scarus swallows have built
 in cleopatra's sails their nests the augurers
 say they know not they cannot tell look grimly
 and dare not speak their knowledge antony

 his fretted fortunes give him hope and fear
 of what he has and has not
 alarum afar off as at a seafight

mark antony all is lost
 this foul egyptian hath betrayed me
 my fleet hath yielded to the foe and yonder
 they cast their caps up and carouse together
 like friends long lost tripleturn'd whore

 hast sold me to this novice and my heart
 makes only wars on thee bid them all fly
 for when i am revenged upon my charm
 i have done all bid them all fly begone
 exit scarus
 o sun thy uprise shall i see no more
 fortune and antony part here even here
 do we shake hands all come to this the hearts
 that spaniel'd me at heels to whom i gave
 their wishes do discandy melt their sweets
 on blossoming caesar and this pine is bark'd
 that overtopp'd them all betray'd i am
 o this false soul of egypt this grave charm
 whose eye beck'd forth my wars and call'd them home
 whose bosom was my crownet my chief end
 like a right gipsy hath at fast and loose
 beguiled me to the very heart of loss

mark antony eros thou yet behold'st me
eros ay noble lord
mark antony sometimes we see a cloud that's dragonish
 a vapour sometime like a bear or lion
 a tower'd citadel a pendent rock
 a forked mountain or blue promontory
 with trees upon't that nod unto the world
 and mock our eyes with air thou hast seen
 these signs
 they are black vesper's pageants
eros ay my lord
mark antony that which is now a horse even with a thought
 the rack dislimns and makes it indistinct
 as water is in water

 yet cannot hold this visible shape my knave
 i made these wars for egypt and the queen
 whose heart i thought i had for she had mine
 which whilst it was mine had annex'd unto't
 a million more now lostshe eros has
 pack'd cards with caesar and falseplay'd my glory

mardian death of one person can be paid but once
 and that she has discharged what thou wouldst do
 is done unto thy hand the last she spake

 the name of antony it was divided
 between her heart and lips she render'd life
 thy name so buried in her

eros what would my lord
mark antony since cleopatra died
 i have lived in such dishonour that the gods
 detest my baseness i that with my sword
 quarter'd the world and o'er green neptune's back
 with ships made cities condemn myself to lack
 the courage of a woman less noble mind
 than she which by her death our caesar tells
 i am conqueror of myself thou art sworn eros
 that when the exigent should come which now
 is come indeed when i should see behind me
 the inevitable prosecution of
 disgrace and horror that on my command
 thou then wouldst kill me do't the time is come
 thou strikest not me tis caesar thou defeat'st
 put colour in thy cheek
eros the gods withhold me
 shall i do that which all the parthian darts
 though enemy lost aim and could not
mark antony eros
 wouldst thou be window'd in great rome and see
 thy master thus with pleach'd arms bending down
 his corrigible neck his face subdued
 to penetrative shame whilst the wheel'd seat
 of fortunate caesar drawn before him branded
 his baseness that ensued
eros i would not see't
mark antony come then for with a wound i must be cured
 draw that thy honest sword which thou hast worn
 most useful for thy country
eros o sir pardon me
mark antony when i did make thee free sworest thou not then
 to do this when i bade thee do it at once
 or thy precedent services are all
 but accidents unpurposed draw and come
eros turn from me then that noble countenance
 wherein the worship of the whole world lies
mark antony lo thee
 turning from him
eros my sword is drawn
mark antony then let it do at once
 the thing why thou hast drawn it
eros my dear master
 my captain and my emperor let me say
 before i strike this bloody stroke farewell
mark antony tis said man and farewell
eros farewell great chief shall i strike now
mark antony now eros
eros why there then thus i do escape the sorrow
