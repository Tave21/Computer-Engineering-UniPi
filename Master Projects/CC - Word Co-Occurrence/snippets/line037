1sm97 then said saul to his servant but behold if we go what shall we bring the man for the bread is spent in our vessels and there is not a present to bring to the man of god what have we
1sm98 and the servant answered saul again and said behold i have here at hand the fourth part of a shekel of silver that will i give to the man of god to tell us our way
1sm99 beforetime in israel when a man went to enquire of god thus he spake come and let us go to the seer for he that is now called a prophet was beforetime called a seer
1sm910 then said saul to his servant well said come let us go so they went unto the city where the man of god was
1sm911 and as they went up the hill to the city they found young maidens going out to draw water and said unto them is the seer here
1sm912 and they answered them and said he is behold he is before you make haste now for he came to day to the city for there is a sacrifice of the people to day in the high place
1sm913 as soon as ye be come into the city ye shall straightway find him before he go up to the high place to eat for the people will not eat until he come because he doth bless the sacrifice and afterwards they eat that be bidden now therefore get you up for about this time ye shall find him
1sm914 and they went up into the city and when they were come into the city behold samuel came out against them for to go up to the high place
1sm915 now the lord had told samuel in his ear a day before saul came saying
1sm916 to morrow about this time i will send thee a man out of the land of benjamin and thou shalt anoint him to be captain over my people israel that he may save my people out of the hand of the philistines for i have looked upon my people because their cry is come unto me
1sm917 and when samuel saw saul the lord said unto him behold the man whom i spake to thee of this same shall reign over my people
1sm918 then saul drew near to samuel in the gate and said tell me i pray thee where the seer's house is
1sm919 and samuel answered saul and said i am the seer go up before me unto the high place for ye shall eat with me to day and to morrow i will let thee go and will tell thee all that is in thine heart
1sm920 and as for thine asses that were lost three days ago set not thy mind on them for they are found and on whom is all the desire of israel is it not on thee and on all thy father's house
1sm921 and saul answered and said am not i a benjamite of the smallest of the tribes of israel and my family the least of all the families of the tribe of benjamin wherefore then speakest thou so to me
1sm922 and samuel took saul and his servant and brought them into the parlour and made them sit in the chiefest place among them that were bidden which were about thirty persons
1sm923 and samuel said unto the cook bring the portion which i gave thee of which i said unto thee set it by thee
1sm924 and the cook took up the shoulder and that which was upon it and set it before saul and samuel said behold that which is left set it before thee and eat for unto this time hath it been kept for thee since i said i have invited the people so saul did eat with samuel that day
1sm925 and when they were come down from the high place into the city samuel communed with saul upon the top of the house
1sm926 and they arose early and it came to pass about the spring of the day that samuel called saul to the top of the house saying up that i may send thee away and saul arose and they went out both of them he and samuel abroad
1sm927 and as they were going down to the end of the city samuel said to saul bid the servant pass on before us and he passed on but stand thou still a while that i may shew thee the word of god
1sm101 then samuel took a vial of oil and poured it upon his head and kissed him and said is it not because the lord hath anointed thee to be captain over his inheritance
1sm102 when thou art departed from me to day then thou shalt find two men by rachel's sepulchre in the border of benjamin at zelzah and they will say unto thee the asses which thou wentest to seek are found and lo thy father hath left the care of the asses and sorroweth for you saying what shall i do for my son
1sm103 then shalt thou go on forward from thence and thou shalt come to the plain of tabor and there shall meet thee three men going up to god to bethel one carrying three kids and another carrying three loaves of bread and another carrying a bottle of wine
1sm104 and they will salute thee and give thee two loaves of bread which thou shalt receive of their hands
1sm105 after that thou shalt come to the hill of god where is the garrison of the philistines and it shall come to pass when thou art come thither to the city that thou shalt meet a company of prophets coming down from the high place with a psaltery and a tabret and a pipe and a harp before them and they shall prophesy
1sm106 and the spirit of the lord will come upon thee and thou shalt prophesy with them and shalt be turned into another man
1sm107 and let it be when these signs are come unto thee that thou do as occasion serve thee for god is with thee
1sm108 and thou shalt go down before me to gilgal and behold i will come down unto thee to offer burnt offerings and to sacrifice sacrifices of peace offerings seven days shalt thou tarry till i come to thee and shew thee what thou shalt do
1sm109 and it was so that when he had turned his back to go from samuel god gave him another heart and all those signs came to pass that day
1sm1010 and when they came thither to the hill behold a company of prophets met him and the spirit of god came upon him and he prophesied among them
1sm1011 and it came to pass when all that knew him beforetime saw that behold he prophesied among the prophets then the people said one to another what is this that is come unto the son of kish is saul also among the prophets
1sm1012 and one of the same place answered and said but who is their father therefore it became a proverb is saul also among the prophets
1sm1013 and when he had made an end of prophesying he came to the high place
1sm1014 and saul's uncle said unto him and to his servant whither went ye and he said to seek the asses and when we saw that they were no where we came to samuel
1sm1015 and saul's uncle said tell me i pray thee what samuel said unto you
1sm1016 and saul said unto his uncle he told us plainly that the asses were found but of the matter of the kingdom whereof samuel spake he told him not
1sm1017 and samuel called the people together unto the lord to mizpeh
1sm1018 and said unto the children of israel thus saith the lord god of israel i brought up israel out of egypt and delivered you out of the hand of the egyptians and out of the hand of all kingdoms and of them that oppressed you
1sm1019 and ye have this day rejected your god who himself saved you out of all your adversities and your tribulations and ye have said unto him nay but set a king over us now therefore present yourselves before the lord by your tribes and by your thousands
1sm1020 and when samuel had caused all the tribes of israel to come near the tribe of benjamin was taken
1sm1021 when he had caused the tribe of benjamin to come near by their families the family of matri was taken and saul the son of kish was taken and when they sought him he could not be found
1sm1022 therefore they enquired of the lord further if the man should yet come thither and the lord answered behold he hath hid himself among the stuff
1sm1023 and they ran and fetched him thence and when he stood among the people he was higher than any of the people from his shoulders and upward
1sm1024 and samuel said to all the people see ye him whom the lord hath chosen that there is none like him among all the people and all the people shouted and said god save the king
1sm1025 then samuel told the people the manner of the kingdom and wrote it in a book and laid it up before the lord and samuel sent all the people away every man to his house
1sm1026 and saul also went home to gibeah and there went with him a band of men whose hearts god had touched
1sm1027 but the children of belial said how shall this man save us and they despised him and brought him no presents but he held his peace
1sm111 then nahash the ammonite came up and encamped against jabeshgilead and all the men of jabesh said unto nahash make a covenant with us and we will serve thee
1sm112 and nahash the ammonite answered them on this condition will i make a covenant with you that i may thrust out all your right eyes and lay it for a reproach upon all israel
1sm113 and the elders of jabesh said unto him give us seven days respite that we may send messengers unto all the coasts of israel and then if there be no man to save us we will come out to thee
1sm114 then came the messengers to gibeah of saul and told the tidings in the ears of the people and all the people lifted up their voices and wept
1sm115 and behold saul came after the herd out of the field and saul said what aileth the people that they weep and they told him the tidings of the men of jabesh
1sm116 and the spirit of god came upon saul when he heard those tidings and his anger was kindled greatly
1sm117 and he took a yoke of oxen and hewed them in pieces and sent them throughout all the coasts of israel by the hands of messengers saying whosoever cometh not forth after saul and after samuel so shall it be done unto his oxen and the fear of the lord fell on the people and they came out with one consent
1sm118 and when he numbered them in bezek the children of israel were three hundred thousand and the men of judah thirty thousand
1sm119 and they said unto the messengers that came thus shall ye say unto the men of jabeshgilead to morrow by that time the sun be hot ye shall have help and the messengers came and shewed it to the men of jabesh and they were glad
1sm1110 therefore the men of jabesh said to morrow we will come out unto you and ye shall do with us all that seemeth good unto you
1sm1111 and it was so on the morrow that saul put the people in three companies and they came into the midst of the host in the morning watch and slew the ammonites until the heat of the day and it came to pass that they which remained were scattered so that two of them were not left together
1sm1112 and the people said unto samuel who is he that said shall saul reign over us bring the men that we may put them to death
1sm1113 and saul said there shall not a man be put to death this day for to day the lord hath wrought salvation in israel
1sm1114 then said samuel to the people come and let us go to gilgal and renew the kingdom there
1sm1115 and all the people went to gilgal and there they made saul king before the lord in gilgal and there they sacrificed sacrifices of peace offerings before the lord and there saul and all the men of israel rejoiced greatly
1sm121 and samuel said unto all israel behold i have hearkened unto your voice in all that ye said unto me and have made a king over you
1sm122 and now behold the king walketh before you and i am old and grayheaded and behold my sons are with you and i have walked before you from my childhood unto this day
1sm123 behold here i am witness against me before the lord and before his anointed whose ox have i taken or whose ass have i taken or whom have i defrauded whom have i oppressed or of whose hand have i received any bribe to blind mine eyes therewith and i will restore it you
1sm124 and they said thou hast not defrauded us nor oppressed us neither hast thou taken ought of any man's hand
1sm125 and he said unto them the lord is witness against you and his anointed is witness this day that ye have not found ought in my hand and they answered he is witness
1sm126 and samuel said unto the people it is the lord that advanced moses and aaron and that brought your fathers up out of the land of egypt
1sm127 now therefore stand still that i may reason with you before the lord of all the righteous acts of the lord which he did to you and to your fathers
1sm128 when jacob was come into egypt and your fathers cried unto the lord then the lord sent moses and aaron which brought forth your fathers out of egypt and made them dwell in this place
1sm129 and when they forgat the lord their god he sold them into the hand of sisera captain of the host of hazor and into the hand of the philistines and into the hand of the king of moab and they fought against them
1sm1210 and they cried unto the lord and said we have sinned because we have forsaken the lord and have served baalim and ashtaroth but now deliver us out of the hand of our enemies and we will serve thee
1sm1211 and the lord sent jerubbaal and bedan and jephthah and samuel and delivered you out of the hand of your enemies on every side and ye dwelled safe
1sm1212 and when ye saw that nahash the king of the children of ammon came against you ye said unto me nay but a king shall reign over us when the lord your god was your king
1sm1213 now therefore behold the king whom ye have chosen and whom ye have desired and behold the lord hath set a king over you
1sm1214 if ye will fear the lord and serve him and obey his voice and not rebel against the commandment of the lord then shall both ye and also the king that reigneth over you continue following the lord your god
1sm1215 but if ye will not obey the voice of the lord but rebel against the commandment of the lord then shall the hand of the lord be against you as it was against your fathers
1sm1216 now therefore stand and see this great thing which the lord will do before your eyes
1sm1217 is it not wheat harvest to day i will call unto the lord and he shall send thunder and rain that ye may perceive and see that your wickedness is great which ye have done in the sight of the lord in asking you a king
1sm1218 so samuel called unto the lord and the lord sent thunder and rain that day and all the people greatly feared the lord and samuel
1sm1219 and all the people said unto samuel pray for thy servants unto the lord thy god that we die not for we have added unto all our sins this evil to ask us a king
1sm1220 and samuel said unto the people fear not ye have done all this wickedness yet turn not aside from following the lord but serve the lord with all your heart
1sm1221 and turn ye not aside for then should ye go after vain things which cannot profit nor deliver for they are vain
1sm1222 for the lord will not forsake his people for his great name's sake because it hath pleased the lord to make you his people
1sm1223 moreover as for me god forbid that i should sin against the lord in ceasing to pray for you but i will teach you the good and the right way
1sm1224 only fear the lord and serve him in truth with all your heart for consider how great things he hath done for you
1sm1225 but if ye shall still do wickedly ye shall be consumed both ye and your king
1sm131 saul reigned one year and when he had reigned two years over israel
1sm132 saul chose him three thousand men of israel whereof two thousand were with saul in michmash and in mount bethel and a thousand were with jonathan in gibeah of benjamin and the rest of the people he sent every man to his tent
1sm133 and jonathan smote the garrison of the philistines that was in geba and the philistines heard of it and saul blew the trumpet throughout all the land saying let the hebrews hear
1sm134 and all israel heard say that saul had smitten a garrison of the philistines and that israel also was had in abomination with the philistines and the people were called together after saul to gilgal
1sm135 and the philistines gathered themselves together to fight with israel thirty thousand chariots and six thousand horsemen and people as the sand which is on the sea shore in multitude and they came up and pitched in michmash eastward from bethaven
1sm136 when the men of israel saw that they were in a strait for the people were distressed then the people did hide themselves in caves and in thickets and in rocks and in high places and in pits
1sm137 and some of the hebrews went over jordan to the land of gad and gilead as for saul he was yet in gilgal and all the people followed him trembling
1sm138 and he tarried seven days according to the set time that samuel had appointed but samuel came not to gilgal and the people were scattered from him
1sm139 and saul said bring hither a burnt offering to me and peace offerings and he offered the burnt offering
1sm1310 and it came to pass that as soon as he had made an end of offering the burnt offering behold samuel came and saul went out to meet him that he might salute him
1sm1311 and samuel said what hast thou done and saul said because i saw that the people were scattered from me and that thou camest not within the days appointed and that the philistines gathered themselves together at michmash
1sm1312 therefore said i the philistines will come down now upon me to gilgal and i have not made supplication unto the lord i forced myself therefore and offered a burnt offering
1sm1313 and samuel said to saul thou hast done foolishly thou hast not kept the commandment of the lord thy god which he commanded thee for now would the lord have established thy kingdom upon israel for ever
1sm1314 but now thy kingdom shall not continue the lord hath sought him a man after his own heart and the lord hath commanded him to be captain over his people because thou hast not kept that which the lord commanded thee
1sm1315 and samuel arose and gat him up from gilgal unto gibeah of benjamin and saul numbered the people that were present with him about six hundred men
1sm1316 and saul and jonathan his son and the people that were present with them abode in gibeah of benjamin but the philistines encamped in michmash
1sm1317 and the spoilers came out of the camp of the philistines in three companies one company turned unto the way that leadeth to ophrah unto the land of shual
1sm1318 and another company turned the way to bethhoron and another company turned to the way of the border that looketh to the valley of zeboim toward the wilderness
1sm1319 now there was no smith found throughout all the land of israel for the philistines said lest the hebrews make them swords or spears
1sm1320 but all the israelites went down to the philistines to sharpen every man his share and his coulter and his axe and his mattock
1sm1321 yet they had a file for the mattocks and for the coulters and for the forks and for the axes and to sharpen the goads
1sm1322 so it came to pass in the day of battle that there was neither sword nor spear found in the hand of any of the people that were with saul and jonathan but with saul and with jonathan his son was there found
1sm1323 and the garrison of the philistines went out to the passage of michmash
1sm141 now it came to pass upon a day that jonathan the son of saul said unto the young man that bare his armour come and let us go over to the philistines garrison that is on the other side but he told not his father
1sm142 and saul tarried in the uttermost part of gibeah under a pomegranate tree which is in migron and the people that were with him were about six hundred men
1sm143 and ahiah the son of ahitub ichabod's brother the son of phinehas the son of eli the lord's priest in shiloh wearing an ephod and the people knew not that jonathan was gone
1sm144 and between the passages by which jonathan sought to go over unto the philistines garrison there was a sharp rock on the one side and a sharp rock on the other side and the name of the one was bozez and the name of the other seneh
1sm145 the forefront of the one was situate northward over against michmash and the other southward over against gibeah
1sm146 and jonathan said to the young man that bare his armour come and let us go over unto the garrison of these uncircumcised it may be that the lord will work for us for there is no restraint to the lord to save by many or by few
1sm147 and his armourbearer said unto him do all that is in thine heart turn thee behold i am with thee according to thy heart
1sm148 then said jonathan behold we will pass over unto these men and we will discover ourselves unto them
1sm149 if they say thus unto us tarry until we come to you then we will stand still in our place and will not go up unto them
1sm1410 but if they say thus come up unto us then we will go up for the lord hath delivered them into our hand and this shall be a sign unto us
1sm1411 and both of them discovered themselves unto the garrison of the philistines and the philistines said behold the hebrews come forth out of the holes where they had hid themselves
1sm1412 and the men of the garrison answered jonathan and his armourbearer and said come up to us and we will shew you a thing and jonathan said unto his armourbearer come up after me for the lord hath delivered them into the hand of israel
1sm1413 and jonathan climbed up upon his hands and upon his feet and his armourbearer after him and they fell before jonathan and his armourbearer slew after him
1sm1414 and that first slaughter which jonathan and his armourbearer made was about twenty men within as it were an half acre of land which a yoke of oxen might plow
1sm1415 and there was trembling in the host in the field and among all the people the garrison and the spoilers they also trembled and the earth quaked so it was a very great trembling
1sm1416 and the watchmen of saul in gibeah of benjamin looked and behold the multitude melted away and they went on beating down one another
1sm1417 then said saul unto the people that were with him number now and see who is gone from us and when they had numbered behold jonathan and his armourbearer were not there
1sm1418 and saul said unto ahiah bring hither the ark of god for the ark of god was at that time with the children of israel
1sm1419 and it came to pass while saul talked unto the priest that the noise that was in the host of the philistines went on and increased and saul said unto the priest withdraw thine hand
1sm1420 and saul and all the people that were with him assembled themselves and they came to the battle and behold every man's sword was against his fellow and there was a very great discomfiture
1sm1421 moreover the hebrews that were with the philistines before that time which went up with them into the camp from the country round about even they also turned to be with the israelites that were with saul and jonathan
1sm1422 likewise all the men of israel which had hid themselves in mount ephraim when they heard that the philistines fled even they also followed hard after them in the battle
1sm1423 so the lord saved israel that day and the battle passed over unto bethaven
1sm1424 and the men of israel were distressed that day for saul had adjured the people saying cursed be the man that eateth any food until evening that i may be avenged on mine enemies so none of the people tasted any food
1sm1425 and all they of the land came to a wood and there was honey upon the ground
1sm1426 and when the people were come into the wood behold the honey dropped but no man put his hand to his mouth for the people feared the oath
1sm1427 but jonathan heard not when his father charged the people with the oath wherefore he put forth the end of the rod that was in his hand and dipped it in an honeycomb and put his hand to his mouth and his eyes were enlightened
1sm1428 then answered one of the people and said thy father straitly charged the people with an oath saying cursed be the man that eateth any food this day and the people were faint
1sm1429 then said jonathan my father hath troubled the land see i pray you how mine eyes have been enlightened because i tasted a little of this honey
1sm1430 how much more if haply the people had eaten freely to day of the spoil of their enemies which they found for had there not been now a much greater slaughter among the philistines
1sm1431 and they smote the philistines that day from michmash to aijalon and the people were very faint
1sm1432 and the people flew upon the spoil and took sheep and oxen and calves and slew them on the ground and the people did eat them with the blood
1sm1433 then they told saul saying behold the people sin against the lord in that they eat with the blood and he said ye have transgressed roll a great stone unto me this day
1sm1434 and saul said disperse yourselves among the people and say unto them bring me hither every man his ox and every man his sheep and slay them here and eat and sin not against the lord in eating with the blood and all the people brought every man his ox with him that night and slew them there
1sm1435 and saul built an altar unto the lord the same was the first altar that he built unto the lord
1sm1436 and saul said let us go down after the philistines by night and spoil them until the morning light and let us not leave a man of them and they said do whatsoever seemeth good unto thee then said the priest let us draw near hither unto god
1sm1437 and saul asked counsel of god shall i go down after the philistines wilt thou deliver them into the hand of israel but he answered him not that day
1sm1438 and saul said draw ye near hither all the chief of the people and know and see wherein this sin hath been this day
1sm1439 for as the lord liveth which saveth israel though it be in jonathan my son he shall surely die but there was not a man among all the people that answered him
1sm1440 then said he unto all israel be ye on one side and i and jonathan my son will be on the other side and the people said unto saul do what seemeth good unto thee
1sm1441 therefore saul said unto the lord god of israel give a perfect lot and saul and jonathan were taken but the people escaped
1sm1442 and saul said cast lots between me and jonathan my son and jonathan was taken
1sm1443 then saul said to jonathan tell me what thou hast done and jonathan told him and said i did but taste a little honey with the end of the rod that was in mine hand and lo i must die
1sm1444 and saul answered god do so and more also for thou shalt surely die jonathan
1sm1445 and the people said unto saul shall jonathan die who hath wrought this great salvation in israel god forbid as the lord liveth there shall not one hair of his head fall to the ground for he hath wrought with god this day so the people rescued jonathan that he died not
1sm1446 then saul went up from following the philistines and the philistines went to their own place
1sm1447 so saul took the kingdom over israel and fought against all his enemies on every side against moab and against the children of ammon and against edom and against the kings of zobah and against the philistines and whithersoever he turned himself he vexed them
1sm1448 and he gathered an host and smote the amalekites and delivered israel out of the hands of them that spoiled them
1sm1449 now the sons of saul were jonathan and ishui and melchishua and the names of his two daughters were these the name of the firstborn merab and the name of the younger michal
1sm1450 and the name of saul's wife was ahinoam the daughter of ahimaaz and the name of the captain of his host was abner the son of ner saul's uncle
1sm1451 and kish was the father of saul and ner the father of abner was the son of abiel
1sm1452 and there was sore war against the philistines all the days of saul and when saul saw any strong man or any valiant man he took him unto him
1sm151 samuel also said unto saul the lord sent me to anoint thee to be king over his people over israel now therefore hearken thou unto the voice of the words of the lord
1sm152 thus saith the lord of hosts i remember that which amalek did to israel how he laid wait for him in the way when he came up from egypt
1sm153 now go and smite amalek and utterly destroy all that they have and spare them not but slay both man and woman infant and suckling ox and sheep camel and ass
1sm154 and saul gathered the people together and numbered them in telaim two hundred thousand footmen and ten thousand men of judah
1sm155 and saul came to a city of amalek and laid wait in the valley
1sm156 and saul said unto the kenites go depart get you down from among the amalekites lest i destroy you with them for ye shewed kindness to all the children of israel when they came up out of egypt so the kenites departed from among the amalekites
1sm157 and saul smote the amalekites from havilah until thou comest to shur that is over against egypt
1sm158 and he took agag the king of the amalekites alive and utterly destroyed all the people with the edge of the sword
1sm159 but saul and the people spared agag and the best of the sheep and of the oxen and of the fatlings and the lambs and all that was good and would not utterly destroy them but every thing that was vile and refuse that they destroyed utterly
1sm1510 then came the word of the lord unto samuel saying
1sm1511 it repenteth me that i have set up saul to be king for he is turned back from following me and hath not performed my commandments and it grieved samuel and he cried unto the lord all night
1sm1512 and when samuel rose early to meet saul in the morning it was told samuel saying saul came to carmel and behold he set him up a place and is gone about and passed on and gone down to gilgal
1sm1513 and samuel came to saul and saul said unto him blessed be thou of the lord i have performed the commandment of the lord
1sm1514 and samuel said what meaneth then this bleating of the sheep in mine ears and the lowing of the oxen which i hear
1sm1515 and saul said they have brought them from the amalekites for the people spared the best of the sheep and of the oxen to sacrifice unto the lord thy god and the rest we have utterly destroyed
1sm1516 then samuel said unto saul stay and i will tell thee what the lord hath said to me this night and he said unto him say on
1sm1517 and samuel said when thou wast little in thine own sight wast thou not made the head of the tribes of israel and the lord anointed thee king over israel
1sm1518 and the lord sent thee on a journey and said go and utterly destroy the sinners the amalekites and fight against them until they be consumed
1sm1519 wherefore then didst thou not obey the voice of the lord but didst fly upon the spoil and didst evil in the sight of the lord
1sm1520 and saul said unto samuel yea i have obeyed the voice of the lord and have gone the way which the lord sent me and have brought agag the king of amalek and have utterly destroyed the amalekites
1sm1521 but the people took of the spoil sheep and oxen the chief of the things which should have been utterly destroyed to sacrifice unto the lord thy god in gilgal
1sm1522 and samuel said hath the lord as great delight in burnt offerings and sacrifices as in obeying the voice of the lord behold to obey is better than sacrifice and to hearken than the fat of rams
1sm1523 for rebellion is as the sin of witchcraft and stubbornness is as iniquity and idolatry because thou hast rejected the word of the lord he hath also rejected thee from being king
1sm1524 and saul said unto samuel i have sinned for i have transgressed the commandment of the lord and thy words because i feared the people and obeyed their voice
1sm1525 now therefore i pray thee pardon my sin and turn again with me that i may worship the lord
1sm1526 and samuel said unto saul i will not return with thee for thou hast rejected the word of the lord and the lord hath rejected thee from being king over israel
1sm1527 and as samuel turned about to go away he laid hold upon the skirt of his mantle and it rent
1sm1528 and samuel said unto him the lord hath rent the kingdom of israel from thee this day and hath given it to a neighbour of thine that is better than thou
1sm1529 and also the strength of israel will not lie nor repent for he is not a man that he should repent
1sm1530 then he said i have sinned yet honour me now i pray thee before the elders of my people and before israel and turn again with me that i may worship the lord thy god
1sm1531 so samuel turned again after saul and saul worshipped the lord
1sm1532 then said samuel bring ye hither to me agag the king of the amalekites and agag came unto him delicately and agag said surely the bitterness of death is past
1sm1533 and samuel said as thy sword hath made women childless so shall thy mother be childless among women and samuel hewed agag in pieces before the lord in gilgal
1sm1534 then samuel went to ramah and saul went up to his house to gibeah of saul
1sm1535 and samuel came no more to see saul until the day of his death nevertheless samuel mourned for saul and the lord repented that he had made saul king over israel
1sm161 and the lord said unto samuel how long wilt thou mourn for saul seeing i have rejected him from reigning over israel fill thine horn with oil and go i will send thee to jesse the bethlehemite for i have provided me a king among his sons
1sm162 and samuel said how can i go if saul hear it he will kill me and the lord said take an heifer with thee and say i am come to sacrifice to the lord
