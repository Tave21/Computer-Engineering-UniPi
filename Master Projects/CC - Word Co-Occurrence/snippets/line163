second servant as they pinch one another by the disposition he
 cries out no more reconciles them to his
 entreaty and himself to the drink
first servant but it raises the greater war between him and
 his discretion
second servant why this is to have a name in great men's
 fellowship i had as lief have a reed that will do
 me no service as a partisan i could not heave
first servant to be called into a huge sphere and not to be seen
 to move in't are the holes where eyes should be
 which pitifully disaster the cheeks
 a sennet sounded enter octavius caesar mark
 antony lepidus pompey agrippa mecaenas
 domitius enobarbus menas with other captains
mark antony to octavius caesar thus do they sir they take
 the flow o the nile
 by certain scales i the pyramid they know
 by the height the lowness or the mean if dearth
 or foison follow the higher nilus swells
 the more it promises as it ebbs the seedsman
 upon the slime and ooze scatters his grain
 and shortly comes to harvest

 operation of your sun so is your crocodile

lepidus what manner o thing is your crocodile
mark antony it is shaped sir like itself and it is as broad
 as it hath breadth it is just so high as it is
 and moves with its own organs it lives by that
 which nourisheth it and the elements once out of
 it it transmigrates
lepidus what colour is it of
mark antony of it own colour too
lepidus tis a strange serpent
mark antony tis so and the tears of it are wet
octavius caesar will this description satisfy him
mark antony with the health that pompey gives him else he is a
 very epicure

pompey ah this thou shouldst have done
 and not have spoke on't in me tis villany
 in thee't had been good service thou must know
 tis not my profit that does lead mine honour
 mine honour it repent that e'er thy tongue
 hath so betray'd thine act being done unknown
 i should have found it afterwards well done
 but must condemn it now desist and drink
menas aside for this

 antony and cleopatra
act iii
scene i a plain in syria
 enter ventidius as it were in triumph with silius
 and other romans officers and soldiers the dead
 body of pacorus borne before him
ventidius now darting parthia art thou struck and now
 pleased fortune does of marcus crassus death
 make me revenger bear the king's son's body
 before our army thy pacorus orodes
 pays this for marcus crassus
silius noble ventidius
 whilst yet with parthian blood thy sword is warm
 the fugitive parthians follow spur through media
 mesopotamia and the shelters whither
 the routed fly so thy grand captain antony
 shall set thee on triumphant chariots and
 put garlands on thy head
ventidius o silius silius
 i have done enough a lower place note well
 may make too great an act for learn this silius
 better to leave undone than by our deed
 acquire too high a fame when him we serve's away
 caesar and antony have ever won
 more in their officer than person sossius
 one of my place in syria his lieutenant
 for quick accumulation of renown
 which he achieved by the minute lost his favour
 who does i the wars more than his captain can
 becomes his captain's captain and ambition
 the soldier's virtue rather makes choice of loss
 than gain which darkens him
 i could do more to do antonius good
