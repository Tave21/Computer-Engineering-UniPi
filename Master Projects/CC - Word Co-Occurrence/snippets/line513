 wishing him my meat sure he's a gallant gentleman
simonides he's but a country gentleman
 has done no more than other knights have done
 has broken a staff or so so let it pass
thaisa to me he seems like diamond to glass
pericles yon king's to me like to my father's picture
 which tells me in that glory once he was
 had princes sit like stars about his throne
 and he the sun for them to reverence
 none that beheld him but like lesser lights
 did vail their crowns to his supremacy
 where now his son's like a glowworm in the night
 the which hath fire in darkness none in light
 whereby i see that time's the king of men
 he's both their parent and he is their grave
 and gives them what he will not what they crave
simonides what are you merry knights
knights who can be other in this royal presence
simonides here with a cup that's stored unto the brim
 as you do love fill to your mistress lips
 we drink this health to you
knights we thank your grace
simonides yet pause awhile
 yon knight doth sit too melancholy
 as if the entertainment in our court
 had not a show might countervail his worth
 note it not you thaisa
thaisa what is it
 to me my father
simonides o attend my daughter
 princes in this should live like gods above
 who freely give to every one that comes
 to honour them
 and princes not doing so are like to gnats
 which make a sound but kill'd are wonder'd at
 therefore to make his entrance more sweet
 here say we drink this standingbowl of wine to him
thaisa alas my father it befits not me
 unto a stranger knight to be so bold
 he may my proffer take for an offence
 since men take women's gifts for impudence
simonides how
 do as i bid you or you'll move me else
thaisa aside now by the gods he could not please me better
simonides and furthermore tell him we desire to know of him
 of whence he is his name and parentage
thaisa the king my father sir has drunk to you
pericles i thank him
thaisa wishing it so much blood unto your life
pericles i thank both him and you and pledge him freely
thaisa and further he desires to know of you
 of whence you are your name and parentage
pericles a gentleman of tyre my name pericles
 my education been in arts and arms
 who looking for adventures in the world
 was by the rough seas reft of ships and men
 and after shipwreck driven upon this shore
thaisa he thanks your grace names himself pericles
 a gentleman of tyre
 who only by misfortune of the seas
 bereft of ships and men cast on this shore
simonides now by the gods i pity his misfortune
 and will awake him from his melancholy
 come gentlemen we sit too long on trifles
 and waste the time which looks for other revels
 even in your armours as you are address'd
 will very well become a soldier's dance
 i will not have excuse with saying this
 loud music is too harsh for ladies heads
 since they love men in arms as well as beds
 the knights dance
 so this was well ask'd'twas so well perform'd
 come sir
 here is a lady that wants breathing too
 and i have heard you knights of tyre
 are excellent in making ladies trip
 and that their measures are as excellent
pericles in those that practise them they are my lord
simonides o that's as much as you would be denied
 of your fair courtesy
 the knights and ladies dance
 unclasp unclasp
 thanks gentlemen to all all have done well
 to pericles
 but you the best pages and lights to conduct
 these knights unto their several lodgings
 to pericles
 yours sir
 we have given order to be next our own
pericles i am at your grace's pleasure
simonides princes it is too late to talk of love
 and that's the mark i know you level at
 therefore each one betake him to his rest
 tomorrow all for speeding do their best

 pericles prince of tyre
act ii
scene iv tyre a room in the governor's house
 enter helicanus and escanes
helicanus no escanes know this of me
 antiochus from incest lived not free
 for which the most high gods not minding longer
 to withhold the vengeance that they had in store
 due to this heinous capital offence
 even in the height and pride of all his glory
 when he was seated in a chariot
 of an inestimable value and his daughter with him
 a fire from heaven came and shrivell'd up
 their bodies even to loathing for they so stunk
 that all those eyes adored them ere their fall
 scorn now their hand should give them burial
escanes twas very strange
helicanus and yet but justice for though
 this king were great his greatness was no guard
 to bar heaven's shaft but sin had his reward
escanes tis very true
 enter two or three lords
first lord see not a man in private conference
 or council has respect with him but he
second lord it shall no longer grieve without reproof
third lord and cursed be he that will not second it
first lord follow me then lord helicane a word
helicanus with me and welcome happy day my lords
first lord know that our griefs are risen to the top
 and now at length they overflow their banks
helicanus your griefs for what wrong not your prince you love
first lord wrong not yourself then noble helicane
 but if the prince do live let us salute him
 or know what ground's made happy by his breath
 if in the world he live we'll seek him out
 if in his grave he rest we'll find him there
 and be resolved he lives to govern us
 or dead give's cause to mourn his funeral
 and leave us to our free election
second lord whose death indeed's the strongest in our censure
 and knowing this kingdom is without a head
 like goodly buildings left without a roof
 soon fall to ruinyour noble self
 that best know how to rule and how to reign
 we thus submit untoour sovereign
all live noble helicane
helicanus for honour's cause forbear your suffrages
 if that you love prince pericles forbear
 take i your wish i leap into the seas
 where's hourly trouble for a minute's ease
 a twelvemonth longer let me entreat you to
 forbear the absence of your king
 if in which time expired he not return
 i shall with aged patience bear your yoke
 but if i cannot win you to this love
 go search like nobles like noble subjects
 and in your search spend your adventurous worth
 whom if you find and win unto return
 you shall like diamonds sit about his crown
first lord to wisdom he's a fool that will not yield
 and since lord helicane enjoineth us
 we with our travels will endeavour us
helicanus then you love us we you and we'll clasp hands
 when peers thus knit a kingdom ever stands

act ii
scene v pentapolis a room in the palace
 enter simonides reading a letter at one door
 the knights meet him
first knight good morrow to the good simonides
simonides knights from my daughter this i let you know
 that for this twelvemonth she'll not undertake
 a married life
 her reason to herself is only known
 which yet from her by no means can i get
second knight may we not get access to her my lord
simonides faith by no means she has so strictly tied
 her to her chamber that tis impossible
 one twelve moons more she'll wear diana's livery
 this by the eye of cynthia hath she vow'd
 and on her virgin honour will not break it
third knight loath to bid farewell we take our leaves
 exeunt knights
simonides so
 they are well dispatch'd now to my daughter's letter
 she tells me here she'd wed the stranger knight
 or never more to view nor day nor light
 tis well mistress your choice agrees with mine
 i like that well nay how absolute she's in't
 not minding whether i dislike or no
 well i do commend her choice
 and will no longer have it be delay'd
 soft here he comes i must dissemble it
 enter pericles
pericles all fortune to the good simonides
simonides to you as much sir i am beholding to you
 for your sweet music this last night i do
 protest my ears were never better fed
 with such delightful pleasing harmony
pericles it is your grace's pleasure to commend
 not my desert
simonides sir you are music's master
pericles the worst of all her scholars my good lord
simonides let me ask you one thing
