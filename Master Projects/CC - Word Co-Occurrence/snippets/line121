his countenance was like lightning and his raiment white as snow
and for fear of him the keepers did shake and became as dead men
and the angel answered and said unto the women fear not ye for i know that ye seek jesus which was crucified
he is not here for he is risen as he said come see the place where the lord lay
and go quickly and tell his disciples that he is risen from the dead and behold he goeth before you into galilee there shall ye see him lo i have told you
and they departed quickly from the sepulchre with fear and great joy and did run to bring his disciples word
and as they went to tell his disciples behold jesus met them saying all hail and they came and held him by the feet and worshipped him
then said jesus unto them be not afraid go tell my brethren that they go into galilee and there shall they see me
now when they were going behold some of the watch came into the city and shewed unto the chief priests all the things that were done
and when they were assembled with the elders and had taken counsel they gave large money unto the soldiers
saying say ye his disciples came by night and stole him away while we slept
and if this come to the governor's ears we will persuade him and secure you
so they took the money and did as they were taught and this saying is commonly reported among the jews until this day
then the eleven disciples went away into galilee into a mountain where jesus had appointed them
and when they saw him they worshipped him but some doubted
and jesus came and spake unto them saying all power is given unto me in heaven and in earth
go ye therefore and teach all nations baptizing them in the name of the father and of the son and of the holy ghost
teaching them to observe all things whatsoever i have commanded you and lo i am with you alway even unto the end of the world amen
the beginning of the gospel of jesus christ the son of god
as it is written in the prophets behold i send my messenger before thy face which shall prepare thy way before thee
the voice of one crying in the wilderness prepare ye the way of the lord make his paths straight
john did baptize in the wilderness and preach the baptism of repentance for the remission of sins
and there went out unto him all the land of judaea and they of jerusalem and were all baptized of him in the river of jordan confessing their sins
and john was clothed with camel's hair and with a girdle of a skin about his loins and he did eat locusts and wild honey
and preached saying there cometh one mightier than i after me the latchet of whose shoes i am not worthy to stoop down and unloose
i indeed have baptized you with water but he shall baptize you with the holy ghost
and it came to pass in those days that jesus came from nazareth of galilee and was baptized of john in jordan
and straightway coming up out of the water he saw the heavens opened and the spirit like a dove descending upon him
and there came a voice from heaven saying thou art my beloved son in whom i am well pleased
and immediately the spirit driveth him into the wilderness
and he was there in the wilderness forty days tempted of satan and was with the wild beasts and the angels ministered unto him
now after that john was put in prison jesus came into galilee preaching the gospel of the kingdom of god
and saying the time is fulfilled and the kingdom of god is at hand repent ye and believe the gospel
now as he walked by the sea of galilee he saw simon and andrew his brother casting a net into the sea for they were fishers
and jesus said unto them come ye after me and i will make you to become fishers of men
and straightway they forsook their nets and followed him
and when he had gone a little farther thence he saw james the son of zebedee and john his brother who also were in the ship mending their nets
and straightway he called them and they left their father zebedee in the ship with the hired servants and went after him
and they went into capernaum and straightway on the sabbath day he entered into the synagogue and taught
and they were astonished at his doctrine for he taught them as one that had authority and not as the scribes
and there was in their synagogue a man with an unclean spirit and he cried out
saying let us alone what have we to do with thee thou jesus of nazareth art thou come to destroy us i know thee who thou art the holy one of god
and jesus rebuked him saying hold thy peace and come out of him
and when the unclean spirit had torn him and cried with a loud voice he came out of him
and they were all amazed insomuch that they questioned among themselves saying what thing is this what new doctrine is this for with authority commandeth he even the unclean spirits and they do obey him
and immediately his fame spread abroad throughout all the region round about galilee
and forthwith when they were come out of the synagogue they entered into the house of simon and andrew with james and john
but simon's wife's mother lay sick of a fever and anon they tell him of her
and he came and took her by the hand and lifted her up and immediately the fever left her and she ministered unto them
and at even when the sun did set they brought unto him all that were diseased and them that were possessed with devils
and all the city was gathered together at the door
and he healed many that were sick of divers diseases and cast out many devils and suffered not the devils to speak because they knew him
and in the morning rising up a great while before day he went out and departed into a solitary place and there prayed
and simon and they that were with him followed after him
and when they had found him they said unto him all men seek for thee
and he said unto them let us go into the next towns that i may preach there also for therefore came i forth
and he preached in their synagogues throughout all galilee and cast out devils
and there came a leper to him beseeching him and kneeling down to him and saying unto him if thou wilt thou canst make me clean
and jesus moved with compassion put forth his hand and touched him and saith unto him i will be thou clean
and as soon as he had spoken immediately the leprosy departed from him and he was cleansed
and he straitly charged him and forthwith sent him away
and saith unto him see thou say nothing to any man but go thy way shew thyself to the priest and offer for thy cleansing those things which moses commanded for a testimony unto them
but he went out and began to publish it much and to blaze abroad the matter insomuch that jesus could no more openly enter into the city but was without in desert places and they came to him from every quarter
and again he entered into capernaum after some days and it was noised that he was in the house
and straightway many were gathered together insomuch that there was no room to receive them no not so much as about the door and he preached the word unto them
and they come unto him bringing one sick of the palsy which was borne of four
and when they could not come nigh unto him for the press they uncovered the roof where he was and when they had broken it up they let down the bed wherein the sick of the palsy lay
when jesus saw their faith he said unto the sick of the palsy son thy sins be forgiven thee
but there were certain of the scribes sitting there and reasoning in their hearts
why doth this man thus speak blasphemies who can forgive sins but god only
and immediately when jesus perceived in his spirit that they so reasoned within themselves he said unto them why reason ye these things in your hearts
whether is it easier to say to the sick of the palsy thy sins be forgiven thee or to say arise and take up thy bed and walk
but that ye may know that the son of man hath power on earth to forgive sins he saith to the sick of the palsy
i say unto thee arise and take up thy bed and go thy way into thine house
and immediately he arose took up the bed and went forth before them all insomuch that they were all amazed and glorified god saying we never saw it on this fashion
and he went forth again by the sea side and all the multitude resorted unto him and he taught them
and as he passed by he saw levi the son of alphaeus sitting at the receipt of custom and said unto him follow me and he arose and followed him
and it came to pass that as jesus sat at meat in his house many publicans and sinners sat also together with jesus and his disciples for there were many and they followed him
and when the scribes and pharisees saw him eat with publicans and sinners they said unto his disciples how is it that he eateth and drinketh with publicans and sinners
when jesus heard it he saith unto them they that are whole have no need of the physician but they that are sick i came not to call the righteous but sinners to repentance
and the disciples of john and of the pharisees used to fast and they come and say unto him why do the disciples of john and of the pharisees fast but thy disciples fast not
and jesus said unto them can the children of the bridechamber fast while the bridegroom is with them as long as they have the bridegroom with them they cannot fast
but the days will come when the bridegroom shall be taken away from them and then shall they fast in those days
no man also seweth a piece of new cloth on an old garment else the new piece that filled it up taketh away from the old and the rent is made worse
and no man putteth new wine into old bottles else the new wine doth burst the bottles and the wine is spilled and the bottles will be marred but new wine must be put into new bottles
and it came to pass that he went through the corn fields on the sabbath day and his disciples began as they went to pluck the ears of corn
and the pharisees said unto him behold why do they on the sabbath day that which is not lawful
and he said unto them have ye never read what david did when he had need and was an hungred he and they that were with him
how he went into the house of god in the days of abiathar the high priest and did eat the shewbread which is not lawful to eat but for the priests and gave also to them which were with him
and he said unto them the sabbath was made for man and not man for the sabbath
therefore the son of man is lord also of the sabbath
and he entered again into the synagogue and there was a man there which had a withered hand
and they watched him whether he would heal him on the sabbath day that they might accuse him
and he saith unto the man which had the withered hand stand forth
and he saith unto them is it lawful to do good on the sabbath days or to do evil to save life or to kill but they held their peace
and when he had looked round about on them with anger being grieved for the hardness of their hearts he saith unto the man stretch forth thine hand and he stretched it out and his hand was restored whole as the other
and the pharisees went forth and straightway took counsel with the herodians against him how they might destroy him
but jesus withdrew himself with his disciples to the sea and a great multitude from galilee followed him and from judaea
and from jerusalem and from idumaea and from beyond jordan and they about tyre and sidon a great multitude when they had heard what great things he did came unto him
and he spake to his disciples that a small ship should wait on him because of the multitude lest they should throng him
for he had healed many insomuch that they pressed upon him for to touch him as many as had plagues
and unclean spirits when they saw him fell down before him and cried saying thou art the son of god
and he straitly charged them that they should not make him known
and he goeth up into a mountain and calleth unto him whom he would and they came unto him
and he ordained twelve that they should be with him and that he might send them forth to preach
and to have power to heal sicknesses and to cast out devils
and simon he surnamed peter
and james the son of zebedee and john the brother of james and he surnamed them boanerges which is the sons of thunder
and andrew and philip and bartholomew and matthew and thomas and james the son of alphaeus and thaddaeus and simon the canaanite
and judas iscariot which also betrayed him and they went into an house
and the multitude cometh together again so that they could not so much as eat bread
and when his friends heard of it they went out to lay hold on him for they said he is beside himself
and the scribes which came down from jerusalem said he hath beelzebub and by the prince of the devils casteth he out devils
and he called them unto him and said unto them in parables how can satan cast out satan
and if a kingdom be divided against itself that kingdom cannot stand
and if a house be divided against itself that house cannot stand
and if satan rise up against himself and be divided he cannot stand but hath an end
no man can enter into a strong man's house and spoil his goods except he will first bind the strong man and then he will spoil his house
verily i say unto you all sins shall be forgiven unto the sons of men and blasphemies wherewith soever they shall blaspheme
but he that shall blaspheme against the holy ghost hath never forgiveness but is in danger of eternal damnation
because they said he hath an unclean spirit
there came then his brethren and his mother and standing without sent unto him calling him
and the multitude sat about him and they said unto him behold thy mother and thy brethren without seek for thee
and he answered them saying who is my mother or my brethren
and he looked round about on them which sat about him and said behold my mother and my brethren
for whosoever shall do the will of god the same is my brother and my sister and mother
and he began again to teach by the sea side and there was gathered unto him a great multitude so that he entered into a ship and sat in the sea and the whole multitude was by the sea on the land
and he taught them many things by parables and said unto them in his doctrine
hearken behold there went out a sower to sow
and it came to pass as he sowed some fell by the way side and the fowls of the air came and devoured it up
and some fell on stony ground where it had not much earth and immediately it sprang up because it had no depth of earth
but when the sun was up it was scorched and because it had no root it withered away
and some fell among thorns and the thorns grew up and choked it and it yielded no fruit
and other fell on good ground and did yield fruit that sprang up and increased and brought forth some thirty and some sixty and some an hundred
and he said unto them he that hath ears to hear let him hear
and when he was alone they that were about him with the twelve asked of him the parable
and he said unto them unto you it is given to know the mystery of the kingdom of god but unto them that are without all these things are done in parables
that seeing they may see and not perceive and hearing they may hear and not understand lest at any time they should be converted and their sins should be forgiven them
and he said unto them know ye not this parable and how then will ye know all parables
the sower soweth the word
and these are they by the way side where the word is sown but when they have heard satan cometh immediately and taketh away the word that was sown in their hearts
and these are they likewise which are sown on stony ground who when they have heard the word immediately receive it with gladness
and have no root in themselves and so endure but for a time afterward when affliction or persecution ariseth for the word's sake immediately they are offended
and these are they which are sown among thorns such as hear the word
and the cares of this world and the deceitfulness of riches and the lusts of other things entering in choke the word and it becometh unfruitful
and these are they which are sown on good ground such as hear the word and receive it and bring forth fruit some thirtyfold some sixty and some an hundred
and he said unto them is a candle brought to be put under a bushel or under a bed and not to be set on a candlestick
for there is nothing hid which shall not be manifested neither was any thing kept secret but that it should come abroad
if any man have ears to hear let him hear
and he said unto them take heed what ye hear with what measure ye mete it shall be measured to you and unto you that hear shall more be given
for he that hath to him shall be given and he that hath not from him shall be taken even that which he hath
and he said so is the kingdom of god as if a man should cast seed into the ground
and should sleep and rise night and day and the seed should spring and grow up he knoweth not how
for the earth bringeth forth fruit of herself first the blade then the ear after that the full corn in the ear
but when the fruit is brought forth immediately he putteth in the sickle because the harvest is come
and he said whereunto shall we liken the kingdom of god or with what comparison shall we compare it
it is like a grain of mustard seed which when it is sown in the earth is less than all the seeds that be in the earth
but when it is sown it groweth up and becometh greater than all herbs and shooteth out great branches so that the fowls of the air may lodge under the shadow of it
and with many such parables spake he the word unto them as they were able to hear it
but without a parable spake he not unto them and when they were alone he expounded all things to his disciples
and the same day when the even was come he saith unto them let us pass over unto the other side
and when they had sent away the multitude they took him even as he was in the ship and there were also with him other little ships
and there arose a great storm of wind and the waves beat into the ship so that it was now full
and he was in the hinder part of the ship asleep on a pillow and they awake him and say unto him master carest thou not that we perish
and he arose and rebuked the wind and said unto the sea peace be still and the wind ceased and there was a great calm
and he said unto them why are ye so fearful how is it that ye have no faith
and they feared exceedingly and said one to another what manner of man is this that even the wind and the sea obey him
and they came over unto the other side of the sea into the country of the gadarenes
and when he was come out of the ship immediately there met him out of the tombs a man with an unclean spirit
who had his dwelling among the tombs and no man could bind him no not with chains
because that he had been often bound with fetters and chains and the chains had been plucked asunder by him and the fetters broken in pieces neither could any man tame him
and always night and day he was in the mountains and in the tombs crying and cutting himself with stones
but when he saw jesus afar off he ran and worshipped him
and cried with a loud voice and said what have i to do with thee jesus thou son of the most high god i adjure thee by god that thou torment me not
for he said unto him come out of the man thou unclean spirit
and he asked him what is thy name and he answered saying my name is legion for we are many
and he besought him much that he would not send them away out of the country
now there was there nigh unto the mountains a great herd of swine feeding
and all the devils besought him saying send us into the swine that we may enter into them
and forthwith jesus gave them leave and the unclean spirits went out and entered into the swine and the herd ran violently down a steep place into the sea they were about two thousand and were choked in the sea
and they that fed the swine fled and told it in the city and in the country and they went out to see what it was that was done
and they come to jesus and see him that was possessed with the devil and had the legion sitting and clothed and in his right mind and they were afraid
and they that saw it told them how it befell to him that was possessed with the devil and also concerning the swine
and they began to pray him to depart out of their coasts
and when he was come into the ship he that had been possessed with the devil prayed him that he might be with him
howbeit jesus suffered him not but saith unto him go home to thy friends and tell them how great things the lord hath done for thee and hath had compassion on thee
and he departed and began to publish in decapolis how great things jesus had done for him and all men did marvel
and when jesus was passed over again by ship unto the other side much people gathered unto him and he was nigh unto the sea
and behold there cometh one of the rulers of the synagogue jairus by name and when he saw him he fell at his feet
and besought him greatly saying my little daughter lieth at the point of death i pray thee come and lay thy hands on her that she may be healed and she shall live
and jesus went with him and much people followed him and thronged him
and a certain woman which had an issue of blood twelve years
and had suffered many things of many physicians and had spent all that she had and was nothing bettered but rather grew worse
when she had heard of jesus came in the press behind and touched his garment
for she said if i may touch but his clothes i shall be whole
and straightway the fountain of her blood was dried up and she felt in her body that she was healed of that plague
and jesus immediately knowing in himself that virtue had gone out of him turned him about in the press and said who touched my clothes
and his disciples said unto him thou seest the multitude thronging thee and sayest thou who touched me
and he looked round about to see her that had done this thing
but the woman fearing and trembling knowing what was done in her came and fell down before him and told him all the truth
