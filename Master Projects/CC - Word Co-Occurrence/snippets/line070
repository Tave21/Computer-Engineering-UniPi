o lord my god if i have done this if there be iniquity in my hands
if i have rewarded evil unto him that was at peace with me yea i have delivered him that without cause is mine enemy
let the enemy persecute my soul and take it yea let him tread down my life upon the earth and lay mine honour in the dust selah
arise o lord in thine anger lift up thyself because of the rage of mine enemies and awake for me to the judgment that thou hast commanded
so shall the congregation of the people compass thee about for their sakes therefore return thou on high
the lord shall judge the people judge me o lord according to my righteousness and according to mine integrity that is in me
oh let the wickedness of the wicked come to an end but establish the just for the righteous god trieth the hearts and reins
my defence is of god which saveth the upright in heart
god judgeth the righteous and god is angry with the wicked every day
if he turn not he will whet his sword he hath bent his bow and made it ready
he hath also prepared for him the instruments of death he ordaineth his arrows against the persecutors
behold he travaileth with iniquity and hath conceived mischief and brought forth falsehood
he made a pit and digged it and is fallen into the ditch which he made
his mischief shall return upon his own head and his violent dealing shall come down upon his own pate
i will praise the lord according to his righteousness and will sing praise to the name of the lord most high
o lord our lord how excellent is thy name in all the earth who hast set thy glory above the heavens
out of the mouth of babes and sucklings hast thou ordained strength because of thine enemies that thou mightest still the enemy and the avenger
when i consider thy heavens the work of thy fingers the moon and the stars which thou hast ordained
what is man that thou art mindful of him and the son of man that thou visitest him
for thou hast made him a little lower than the angels and hast crowned him with glory and honour
thou madest him to have dominion over the works of thy hands thou hast put all things under his feet
all sheep and oxen yea and the beasts of the field
the fowl of the air and the fish of the sea and whatsoever passeth through the paths of the seas
o lord our lord how excellent is thy name in all the earth
i will praise thee o lord with my whole heart i will shew forth all thy marvellous works
i will be glad and rejoice in thee i will sing praise to thy name o thou most high
when mine enemies are turned back they shall fall and perish at thy presence
for thou hast maintained my right and my cause thou satest in the throne judging right
thou hast rebuked the heathen thou hast destroyed the wicked thou hast put out their name for ever and ever
o thou enemy destructions are come to a perpetual end and thou hast destroyed cities their memorial is perished with them
but the lord shall endure for ever he hath prepared his throne for judgment
and he shall judge the world in righteousness he shall minister judgment to the people in uprightness
the lord also will be a refuge for the oppressed a refuge in times of trouble
and they that know thy name will put their trust in thee for thou lord hast not forsaken them that seek thee
sing praises to the lord which dwelleth in zion declare among the people his doings
when he maketh inquisition for blood he remembereth them he forgetteth not the cry of the humble
have mercy upon me o lord consider my trouble which i suffer of them that hate me thou that liftest me up from the gates of death
that i may shew forth all thy praise in the gates of the daughter of zion i will rejoice in thy salvation
the heathen are sunk down in the pit that they made in the net which they hid is their own foot taken
the lord is known by the judgment which he executeth the wicked is snared in the work of his own hands higgaion selah
the wicked shall be turned into hell and all the nations that forget god
for the needy shall not alway be forgotten the expectation of the poor shall not perish for ever
arise o lord let not man prevail let the heathen be judged in thy sight
put them in fear o lord that the nations may know themselves to be but men selah
why standest thou afar off o lord why hidest thou thyself in times of trouble
the wicked in his pride doth persecute the poor let them be taken in the devices that they have imagined
for the wicked boasteth of his heart's desire and blesseth the covetous whom the lord abhorreth
the wicked through the pride of his countenance will not seek after god god is not in all his thoughts
his ways are always grievous thy judgments are far above out of his sight as for all his enemies he puffeth at them
he hath said in his heart i shall not be moved for i shall never be in adversity
his mouth is full of cursing and deceit and fraud under his tongue is mischief and vanity
he sitteth in the lurking places of the villages in the secret places doth he murder the innocent his eyes are privily set against the poor
he lieth in wait secretly as a lion in his den he lieth in wait to catch the poor he doth catch the poor when he draweth him into his net
he croucheth and humbleth himself that the poor may fall by his strong ones
he hath said in his heart god hath forgotten he hideth his face he will never see it
arise o lord o god lift up thine hand forget not the humble
wherefore doth the wicked contemn god he hath said in his heart thou wilt not require it
thou hast seen it for thou beholdest mischief and spite to requite it with thy hand the poor committeth himself unto thee thou art the helper of the fatherless
break thou the arm of the wicked and the evil man seek out his wickedness till thou find none
the lord is king for ever and ever the heathen are perished out of his land
lord thou hast heard the desire of the humble thou wilt prepare their heart thou wilt cause thine ear to hear
to judge the fatherless and the oppressed that the man of the earth may no more oppress
in the lord put i my trust how say ye to my soul flee as a bird to your mountain
for lo the wicked bend their bow they make ready their arrow upon the string that they may privily shoot at the upright in heart
if the foundations be destroyed what can the righteous do
the lord is in his holy temple the lord's throne is in heaven his eyes behold his eyelids try the children of men
the lord trieth the righteous but the wicked and him that loveth violence his soul hateth
upon the wicked he shall rain snares fire and brimstone and an horrible tempest this shall be the portion of their cup
for the righteous lord loveth righteousness his countenance doth behold the upright
help lord for the godly man ceaseth for the faithful fail from among the children of men
they speak vanity every one with his neighbour with flattering lips and with a double heart do they speak
the lord shall cut off all flattering lips and the tongue that speaketh proud things
who have said with our tongue will we prevail our lips are our own who is lord over us
for the oppression of the poor for the sighing of the needy now will i arise saith the lord i will set him in safety from him that puffeth at him
the words of the lord are pure words as silver tried in a furnace of earth purified seven times
thou shalt keep them o lord thou shalt preserve them from this generation for ever
the wicked walk on every side when the vilest men are exalted
how long wilt thou forget me o lord for ever how long wilt thou hide thy face from me
how long shall i take counsel in my soul having sorrow in my heart daily how long shall mine enemy be exalted over me
consider and hear me o lord my god lighten mine eyes lest i sleep the sleep of death
lest mine enemy say i have prevailed against him and those that trouble me rejoice when i am moved
but i have trusted in thy mercy my heart shall rejoice in thy salvation
i will sing unto the lord because he hath dealt bountifully with me
the fool hath said in his heart there is no god they are corrupt they have done abominable works there is none that doeth good
the lord looked down from heaven upon the children of men to see if there were any that did understand and seek god
they are all gone aside they are all together become filthy there is none that doeth good no not one
have all the workers of iniquity no knowledge who eat up my people as they eat bread and call not upon the lord
there were they in great fear for god is in the generation of the righteous
ye have shamed the counsel of the poor because the lord is his refuge
oh that the salvation of israel were come out of zion when the lord bringeth back the captivity of his people jacob shall rejoice and israel shall be glad
lord who shall abide in thy tabernacle who shall dwell in thy holy hill
he that walketh uprightly and worketh righteousness and speaketh the truth in his heart
he that backbiteth not with his tongue nor doeth evil to his neighbour nor taketh up a reproach against his neighbour
in whose eyes a vile person is contemned but he honoureth them that fear the lord he that sweareth to his own hurt and changeth not
he that putteth not out his money to usury nor taketh reward against the innocent he that doeth these things shall never be moved
preserve me o god for in thee do i put my trust
o my soul thou hast said unto the lord thou art my lord my goodness extendeth not to thee
but to the saints that are in the earth and to the excellent in whom is all my delight
their sorrows shall be multiplied that hasten after another god their drink offerings of blood will i not offer nor take up their names into my lips
the lord is the portion of mine inheritance and of my cup thou maintainest my lot
the lines are fallen unto me in pleasant places yea i have a goodly heritage
i will bless the lord who hath given me counsel my reins also instruct me in the night seasons
i have set the lord always before me because he is at my right hand i shall not be moved
therefore my heart is glad and my glory rejoiceth my flesh also shall rest in hope
for thou wilt not leave my soul in hell neither wilt thou suffer thine holy one to see corruption
thou wilt shew me the path of life in thy presence is fulness of joy at thy right hand there are pleasures for evermore
hear the right o lord attend unto my cry give ear unto my prayer that goeth not out of feigned lips
let my sentence come forth from thy presence let thine eyes behold the things that are equal
thou hast proved mine heart thou hast visited me in the night thou hast tried me and shalt find nothing i am purposed that my mouth shall not transgress
concerning the works of men by the word of thy lips i have kept me from the paths of the destroyer
hold up my goings in thy paths that my footsteps slip not
i have called upon thee for thou wilt hear me o god incline thine ear unto me and hear my speech
shew thy marvellous lovingkindness o thou that savest by thy right hand them which put their trust in thee from those that rise up against them
keep me as the apple of the eye hide me under the shadow of thy wings
from the wicked that oppress me from my deadly enemies who compass me about
they are inclosed in their own fat with their mouth they speak proudly
they have now compassed us in our steps they have set their eyes bowing down to the earth
like as a lion that is greedy of his prey and as it were a young lion lurking in secret places
arise o lord disappoint him cast him down deliver my soul from the wicked which is thy sword
from men which are thy hand o lord from men of the world which have their portion in this life and whose belly thou fillest with thy hid treasure they are full of children and leave the rest of their substance to their babes
as for me i will behold thy face in righteousness i shall be satisfied when i awake with thy likeness
i will love thee o lord my strength
the lord is my rock and my fortress and my deliverer my god my strength in whom i will trust my buckler and the horn of my salvation and my high tower
i will call upon the lord who is worthy to be praised so shall i be saved from mine enemies
the sorrows of death compassed me and the floods of ungodly men made me afraid
the sorrows of hell compassed me about the snares of death prevented me
in my distress i called upon the lord and cried unto my god he heard my voice out of his temple and my cry came before him even into his ears
then the earth shook and trembled the foundations also of the hills moved and were shaken because he was wroth
there went up a smoke out of his nostrils and fire out of his mouth devoured coals were kindled by it
he bowed the heavens also and came down and darkness was under his feet
and he rode upon a cherub and did fly yea he did fly upon the wings of the wind
he made darkness his secret place his pavilion round about him were dark waters and thick clouds of the skies
at the brightness that was before him his thick clouds passed hail stones and coals of fire
the lord also thundered in the heavens and the highest gave his voice hail stones and coals of fire
yea he sent out his arrows and scattered them and he shot out lightnings and discomfited them
then the channels of waters were seen and the foundations of the world were discovered at thy rebuke o lord at the blast of the breath of thy nostrils
he sent from above he took me he drew me out of many waters
he delivered me from my strong enemy and from them which hated me for they were too strong for me
they prevented me in the day of my calamity but the lord was my stay
he brought me forth also into a large place he delivered me because he delighted in me
the lord rewarded me according to my righteousness according to the cleanness of my hands hath he recompensed me
for i have kept the ways of the lord and have not wickedly departed from my god
for all his judgments were before me and i did not put away his statutes from me
i was also upright before him and i kept myself from mine iniquity
therefore hath the lord recompensed me according to my righteousness according to the cleanness of my hands in his eyesight
with the merciful thou wilt shew thyself merciful with an upright man thou wilt shew thyself upright
with the pure thou wilt shew thyself pure and with the froward thou wilt shew thyself froward
for thou wilt save the afflicted people but wilt bring down high looks
for thou wilt light my candle the lord my god will enlighten my darkness
for by thee i have run through a troop and by my god have i leaped over a wall
as for god his way is perfect the word of the lord is tried he is a buckler to all those that trust in him
for who is god save the lord or who is a rock save our god
it is god that girdeth me with strength and maketh my way perfect
he maketh my feet like hinds feet and setteth me upon my high places
he teacheth my hands to war so that a bow of steel is broken by mine arms
thou hast also given me the shield of thy salvation and thy right hand hath holden me up and thy gentleness hath made me great
thou hast enlarged my steps under me that my feet did not slip
i have pursued mine enemies and overtaken them neither did i turn again till they were consumed
i have wounded them that they were not able to rise they are fallen under my feet
for thou hast girded me with strength unto the battle thou hast subdued under me those that rose up against me
thou hast also given me the necks of mine enemies that i might destroy them that hate me
they cried but there was none to save them even unto the lord but he answered them not
then did i beat them small as the dust before the wind i did cast them out as the dirt in the streets
thou hast delivered me from the strivings of the people and thou hast made me the head of the heathen a people whom i have not known shall serve me
as soon as they hear of me they shall obey me the strangers shall submit themselves unto me
the strangers shall fade away and be afraid out of their close places
the lord liveth and blessed be my rock and let the god of my salvation be exalted
it is god that avengeth me and subdueth the people under me
he delivereth me from mine enemies yea thou liftest me up above those that rise up against me thou hast delivered me from the violent man
therefore will i give thanks unto thee o lord among the heathen and sing praises unto thy name
great deliverance giveth he to his king and sheweth mercy to his anointed to david and to his seed for evermore
the heavens declare the glory of god and the firmament sheweth his handywork
day unto day uttereth speech and night unto night sheweth knowledge
there is no speech nor language where their voice is not heard
their line is gone out through all the earth and their words to the end of the world in them hath he set a tabernacle for the sun
which is as a bridegroom coming out of his chamber and rejoiceth as a strong man to run a race
his going forth is from the end of the heaven and his circuit unto the ends of it and there is nothing hid from the heat thereof
the law of the lord is perfect converting the soul the testimony of the lord is sure making wise the simple
the statutes of the lord are right rejoicing the heart the commandment of the lord is pure enlightening the eyes
the fear of the lord is clean enduring for ever the judgments of the lord are true and righteous altogether
more to be desired are they than gold yea than much fine gold sweeter also than honey and the honeycomb
moreover by them is thy servant warned and in keeping of them there is great reward
who can understand his errors cleanse thou me from secret faults
keep back thy servant also from presumptuous sins let them not have dominion over me then shall i be upright and i shall be innocent from the great transgression
let the words of my mouth and the meditation of my heart be acceptable in thy sight o lord my strength and my redeemer
the lord hear thee in the day of trouble the name of the god of jacob defend thee
send thee help from the sanctuary and strengthen thee out of zion
remember all thy offerings and accept thy burnt sacrifice selah
grant thee according to thine own heart and fulfil all thy counsel
we will rejoice in thy salvation and in the name of our god we will set up our banners the lord fulfil all thy petitions
now know i that the lord saveth his anointed he will hear him from his holy heaven with the saving strength of his right hand
some trust in chariots and some in horses but we will remember the name of the lord our god
they are brought down and fallen but we are risen and stand upright
save lord let the king hear us when we call
the king shall joy in thy strength o lord and in thy salvation how greatly shall he rejoice
thou hast given him his heart's desire and hast not withholden the request of his lips selah
for thou preventest him with the blessings of goodness thou settest a crown of pure gold on his head
he asked life of thee and thou gavest it him even length of days for ever and ever
his glory is great in thy salvation honour and majesty hast thou laid upon him
for thou hast made him most blessed for ever thou hast made him exceeding glad with thy countenance
