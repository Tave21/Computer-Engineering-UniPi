 my peace we will begin and caius lucius
 although the victor we submit to caesar
 and to the roman empire promising
 to pay our wonted tribute from the which
 we were dissuaded by our wicked queen
 whom heavens in justice both on her and hers
 have laid most heavy hand
soothsayer the fingers of the powers above do tune
 the harmony of this peace the vision
 which i made known to lucius ere the stroke
 of this yet scarcecold battle at this instant
 is full accomplish'd for the roman eagle
 from south to west on wing soaring aloft
 lessen'd herself and in the beams o the sun
 so vanish'd which foreshow'd our princely eagle
 the imperial caesar should again unite
 his favour with the radiant cymbeline
 which shines here in the west
cymbeline laud we the gods
 and let our crooked smokes climb to their nostrils
 from our blest altars publish we this peace
 to all our subjects set we forward let
 a roman and a british ensign wave
 friendly together so through lud'stown march
 and in the temple of great jupiter
 our peace we'll ratify seal it with feasts
 set on there never was a war did cease
 ere bloody hands were wash'd with such a peace

scene i the king of navarre's park
 enter ferdinand king of navarre biron longaville
 and dumain
ferdinand let fame that all hunt after in their lives
 live register'd upon our brazen tombs
 and then grace us in the disgrace of death
 when spite of cormorant devouring time
 the endeavor of this present breath may buy
 that honour which shall bate his scythe's keen edge
 and make us heirs of all eternity
 therefore brave conquerorsfor so you are
 that war against your own affections
 and the huge army of the world's desires
 our late edict shall strongly stand in force
 navarre shall be the wonder of the world
 our court shall be a little academe
 still and contemplative in living art
 you three biron dumain and longaville
 have sworn for three years term to live with me
 my fellowscholars and to keep those statutes
 that are recorded in this schedule here
 your oaths are pass'd and now subscribe your names
 that his own hand may strike his honour down
 that violates the smallest branch herein
 if you are arm'd to do as sworn to do
 subscribe to your deep oaths and keep it too
longaville i am resolved tis but a three years fast
 the mind shall banquet though the body pine
 fat paunches have lean pates and dainty bits
 make rich the ribs but bankrupt quite the wits
dumain my loving lord dumain is mortified
 the grosser manner of these world's delights
 he throws upon the gross world's baser slaves
 to love to wealth to pomp i pine and die
 with all these living in philosophy
biron i can but say their protestation over
 so much dear liege i have already sworn
 that is to live and study here three years
 but there are other strict observances
 as not to see a woman in that term
 which i hope well is not enrolled there
 and one day in a week to touch no food
 and but one meal on every day beside
 the which i hope is not enrolled there
 and then to sleep but three hours in the night
 and not be seen to wink of all the day
 when i was wont to think no harm all night
 and make a dark night too of half the day
 which i hope well is not enrolled there
 o these are barren tasks too hard to keep
 not to see ladies study fast not sleep
ferdinand your oath is pass'd to pass away from these
biron let me say no my liege an if you please
 i only swore to study with your grace
 and stay here in your court for three years space
longaville you swore to that biron and to the rest
biron by yea and nay sir then i swore in jest
 what is the end of study let me know
ferdinand why that to know which else we should not know
biron things hid and barr'd you mean from common sense
ferdinand ay that is study's godlike recompense
biron come on then i will swear to study so
 to know the thing i am forbid to know
 as thusto study where i well may dine
 when i to feast expressly am forbid
 or study where to meet some mistress fine
 when mistresses from common sense are hid
 or having sworn too hard a keeping oath
 study to break it and not break my troth
 if study's gain be thus and this be so
 study knows that which yet it doth not know
 swear me to this and i will ne'er say no
ferdinand these be the stops that hinder study quite
 and train our intellects to vain delight
biron why all delights are vain but that most vain
 which with pain purchased doth inherit pain
 as painfully to pore upon a book
 to seek the light of truth while truth the while
 doth falsely blind the eyesight of his look
 light seeking light doth light of light beguile
 so ere you find where light in darkness lies
 your light grows dark by losing of your eyes
 study me how to please the eye indeed
 by fixing it upon a fairer eye
 who dazzling so that eye shall be his heed
 and give him light that it was blinded by
 study is like the heaven's glorious sun
 that will not be deepsearch'd with saucy looks
 small have continual plodders ever won
 save base authority from others books
 these earthly godfathers of heaven's lights
 that give a name to every fixed star
 have no more profit of their shining nights
 than those that walk and wot not what they are
 too much to know is to know nought but fame
 and every godfather can give a name
ferdinand how well he's read to reason against reading
dumain proceeded well to stop all good proceeding
longaville he weeds the corn and still lets grow the weeding
biron the spring is near when green geese are abreeding
dumain how follows that
biron fit in his place and time
dumain in reason nothing
biron something then in rhyme
ferdinand biron is like an envious sneaping frost
 that bites the firstborn infants of the spring
biron well say i am why should proud summer boast
 before the birds have any cause to sing
 why should i joy in any abortive birth
 at christmas i no more desire a rose
 than wish a snow in may's newfangled mirth
 but like of each thing that in season grows
 so you to study now it is too late
 climb o'er the house to unlock the little gate
ferdinand well sit you out go home biron adieu
biron no my good lord i have sworn to stay with you
 and though i have for barbarism spoke more
 than for that angel knowledge you can say
 yet confident i'll keep what i have swore
 and bide the penance of each three years day
 give me the paper let me read the same
 and to the strict'st decrees i'll write my name
ferdinand how well this yielding rescues thee from shame
biron reads item that no woman shall come within a
 mile of my court hath this been proclaimed
longaville four days ago
biron let's see the penalty
 reads
 on pain of losing her tongue who devised this penalty
longaville marry that did i
biron sweet lord and why
longaville to fright them hence with that dread penalty
biron a dangerous law against gentility
 reads
 item if any man be seen to talk with a woman
 within the term of three years he shall endure such
 public shame as the rest of the court can possibly devise'
 this article my liege yourself must break
 for well you know here comes in embassy
 the french king's daughter with yourself to speak
