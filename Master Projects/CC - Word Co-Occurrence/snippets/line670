 had been the regent there instead of me
 he never would have stay'd in france so long
york no not to lose it all as thou hast done
 i rather would have lost my life betimes
 than bring a burthen of dishonour home
 by staying there so long till all were lost
 show me one scar character'd on thy skin
 men's flesh preserved so whole do seldom win
queen margaret nay then this spark will prove a raging fire
 if wind and fuel be brought to feed it with
 no more good york sweet somerset be still
 thy fortune york hadst thou been regent there
 might happily have proved far worse than his
york what worse than nought nay then a shame take all
somerset and in the number thee that wishest shame
cardinal my lord of york try what your fortune is
 the uncivil kerns of ireland are in arms
 and temper clay with blood of englishmen
 to ireland will you lead a band of men
 collected choicely from each county some
 and try your hap against the irishmen
york i will my lord so please his majesty
suffolk why our authority is his consent
 and what we do establish he confirms
 then noble york take thou this task in hand
york i am content provide me soldiers lords
 whiles i take order for mine own affairs
suffolk a charge lord york that i will see perform'd
 but now return we to the false duke humphrey
cardinal no more of him for i will deal with him
 that henceforth he shall trouble us no more
 and so break off the day is almost spent
 lord suffolk you and i must talk of that event
york my lord of suffolk within fourteen days
 at bristol i expect my soldiers
 for there i'll ship them all for ireland
suffolk i'll see it truly done my lord of york
 exeunt all but york
york now york or never steel thy fearful thoughts
 and change misdoubt to resolution
 be that thou hopest to be or what thou art
 resign to death it is not worth the enjoying
 let palefaced fear keep with the meanborn man
 and find no harbour in a royal heart
 faster than springtime showers comes thought
 on thought
 and not a thought but thinks on dignity
 my brain more busy than the labouring spider
 weaves tedious snares to trap mine enemies
 well nobles well tis politicly done
 to send me packing with an host of men
 i fear me you but warm the starved snake
 who cherish'd in your breasts will sting
 your hearts
 twas men i lack'd and you will give them me
 i take it kindly and yet be well assured
 you put sharp weapons in a madman's hands
 whiles i in ireland nourish a mighty band
 i will stir up in england some black storm
 shall blow ten thousand souls to heaven or hell
 and this fell tempest shall not cease to rage
 until the golden circuit on my head
 like to the glorious sun's transparent beams
 do calm the fury of this madbred flaw
 and for a minister of my intent
 i have seduced a headstrong kentishman
 john cade of ashford
 to make commotion as full well he can
 under the title of john mortimer
 in ireland have i seen this stubborn cade
 oppose himself against a troop of kerns
 and fought so long till that his thighs with darts
 were almost like a sharpquill'd porpentine
 and in the end being rescued i have seen
 him caper upright like a wild morisco
 shaking the bloody darts as he his bells
 full often like a shaghair'd crafty kern
 hath he conversed with the enemy
 and undiscover'd come to me again
 and given me notice of their villanies
 this devil here shall be my substitute
 for that john mortimer which now is dead
 in face in gait in speech he doth resemble
 by this i shall perceive the commons mind
 how they affect the house and claim of york
 say he be taken rack'd and tortured
 i know no pain they can inflict upon him
 will make him say i moved him to those arms
 say that he thrive as tis great like he will
 why then from ireland come i with my strength
 and reap the harvest which that rascal sow'd
 for humphrey being dead as he shall be
 and henry put apart the next for me

 according as i gave directions
first murderer tis my good lord

 sound trumpets enter king henry vi queen
 margaret cardinal somerset with attendants
king henry vi go call our uncle to our presence straight
 say we intend to try his grace today
 if he be guilty as tis published
suffolk i'll call him presently my noble lord
 exit
king henry vi lords take your places and i pray you all
 proceed no straiter gainst our uncle gloucester
 than from true evidence of good esteem
 he be approved in practise culpable
queen margaret god forbid any malice should prevail
 that faultless may condemn a nobleman
 pray god he may acquit him of suspicion
king henry vi i thank thee meg these words content me much
 reenter suffolk
 how now why look'st thou pale why tremblest thou
 where is our uncle what's the matter suffolk
suffolk dead in his bed my lord gloucester is dead
queen margaret marry god forfend
cardinal god's secret judgment i did dream tonight
 the duke was dumb and could not speak a word
 king henry vi swoons
queen margaret how fares my lord help lords the king is dead
somerset rear up his body wring him by the nose
queen margaret run go help help o henry ope thine eyes
suffolk he doth revive again madam be patient
king henry vi o heavenly god
queen margaret how fares my gracious lord
suffolk comfort my sovereign gracious henry comfort
king henry vi what doth my lord of suffolk comfort me
 came he right now to sing a raven's note
 whose dismal tune bereft my vital powers
 and thinks he that the chirping of a wren
 by crying comfort from a hollow breast
 can chase away the firstconceived sound
 hide not thy poison with such sugar'd words
 lay not thy hands on me forbear i say
 their touch affrights me as a serpent's sting
 thou baleful messenger out of my sight
 upon thy eyeballs murderous tyranny
 sits in grim majesty to fright the world
 look not upon me for thine eyes are wounding
 yet do not go away come basilisk
 and kill the innocent gazer with thy sight
 for in the shade of death i shall find joy
 in life but double death now gloucester's dead
queen margaret why do you rate my lord of suffolk thus
 although the duke was enemy to him
 yet he most christianlike laments his death
 and for myself foe as he was to me
 might liquid tears or heartoffending groans
 or bloodconsuming sighs recall his life
 i would be blind with weeping sick with groans
 look pale as primrose with blooddrinking sighs
 and all to have the noble duke alive
 what know i how the world may deem of me
 for it is known we were but hollow friends
 it may be judged i made the duke away
 so shall my name with slander's tongue be wounded
 and princes courts be fill'd with my reproach
 this get i by his death ay me unhappy
 to be a queen and crown'd with infamy
king henry vi ah woe is me for gloucester wretched man
queen margaret be woe for me more wretched than he is
 what dost thou turn away and hide thy face
 i am no loathsome leper look on me
 what art thou like the adder waxen deaf
 be poisonous too and kill thy forlorn queen
 is all thy comfort shut in gloucester's tomb
 why then dame margaret was ne'er thy joy
 erect his statue and worship it
 and make my image but an alehouse sign
 was i for this nigh wreck'd upon the sea
 and twice by awkward wind from england's bank
 drove back again unto my native clime
 what boded this but well forewarning wind
 did seem to say seek not a scorpion's nest
 nor set no footing on this unkind shore'
 what did i then but cursed the gentle gusts
 and he that loosed them forth their brazen caves
 and bid them blow towards england's blessed shore
 or turn our stern upon a dreadful rock
 yet aeolus would not be a murderer
 but left that hateful office unto thee
 the prettyvaulting sea refused to drown me
