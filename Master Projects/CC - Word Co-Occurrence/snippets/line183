 when with his amazonian chin he drove
 the bristled lips before him be bestrid
 an o'erpress'd roman and i the consul's view
 slew three opposers tarquin's self he met
 and struck him on his knee in that day's feats
 when he might act the woman in the scene
 he proved best man i the field and for his meed
 was browbound with the oak his pupil age
 manenter'd thus he waxed like a sea
 and in the brunt of seventeen battles since
 he lurch'd all swords of the garland for this last
 before and in corioli let me say
 i cannot speak him home he stopp'd the fliers
 and by his rare example made the coward
 turn terror into sport as weeds before
 a vessel under sail so men obey'd
 and fell below his stem his sword death's stamp
 where it did mark it took from face to foot
 he was a thing of blood whose every motion
 was timed with dying cries alone he enter'd
 the mortal gate of the city which he painted
 with shunless destiny aidless came off
 and with a sudden reinforcement struck
 corioli like a planet now all's his
 when by and by the din of war gan pierce
 his ready sense then straight his doubled spirit
 requicken'd what in flesh was fatigate
 and to the battle came he where he did
 run reeking o'er the lives of men as if
 twere a perpetual spoil and till we call'd
 both field and city ours he never stood
 to ease his breast with panting
menenius worthy man
first senator he cannot but with measure fit the honours
 which we devise him
cominius our spoils he kick'd at
 and look'd upon things precious as they were
 the common muck of the world he covets less
 than misery itself would give rewards
 his deeds with doing them and is content
 to spend the time to end it
menenius he's right noble
 let him be call'd for
first senator call coriolanus
officer he doth appear
 reenter coriolanus
menenius the senate coriolanus are well pleased
 to make thee consul
coriolanus i do owe them still
 my life and services
menenius it then remains
 that you do speak to the people
coriolanus i do beseech you
 let me o'erleap that custom for i cannot
 put on the gown stand naked and entreat them
 for my wounds sake to give their suffrage please you
 that i may pass this doing
sicinius sir the people
 must have their voices neither will they bate
 one jot of ceremony
menenius put them not to't
 pray you go fit you to the custom and
 take to you as your predecessors have
 your honour with your form
coriolanus it is apart
 that i shall blush in acting and might well
 be taken from the people
brutus mark you that
coriolanus to brag unto them thus i did and thus
 show them the unaching scars which i should hide
 as if i had received them for the hire
 of their breath only
menenius do not stand upon't
 we recommend to you tribunes of the people
 our purpose to them and to our noble consul
 wish we all joy and honour
senators to coriolanus come all joy and honour
 flourish of cornets exeunt all but sicinius
 and brutus
brutus you see how he intends to use the people
sicinius may they perceive's intent he will require them
 as if he did contemn what he requested
 should be in them to give
brutus come we'll inform them
 of our proceedings here on the marketplace
 i know they do attend us
 exeunt
 coriolanus
act ii
scene iii the same the forum
 enter seven or eight citizens
first citizen once if he do require our voices we ought not to deny him
second citizen we may sir if we will
third citizen we have power in ourselves to do it but it is a
 power that we have no power to do for if he show us
 his wounds and tell us his deeds we are to put our
 tongues into those wounds and speak for them so if
 he tell us his noble deeds we must also tell him
 our noble acceptance of them ingratitude is
 monstrous and for the multitude to be ingrateful
 were to make a monster of the multitude of the
 which we being members should bring ourselves to be
 monstrous members
first citizen and to make us no better thought of a little help
 will serve for once we stood up about the corn he
 himself stuck not to call us the manyheaded multitude
third citizen we have been called so of many not that our heads
 are some brown some black some auburn some bald
 but that our wits are so diversely coloured and
 truly i think if all our wits were to issue out of
 one skull they would fly east west north south
 and their consent of one direct way should be at
 once to all the points o the compass
second citizen think you so which way do you judge my wit would
 fly
third citizen nay your wit will not so soon out as another man's
 will'tis strongly wedged up in a blockhead but
 if it were at liberty twould sure southward
second citizen why that way
third citizen to lose itself in a fog where being three parts
 melted away with rotten dews the fourth would return
 for conscience sake to help to get thee a wife
second citizen you are never without your tricks you may you may
third citizen are you all resolved to give your voices but
 that's no matter the greater part carries it i
 say if he would incline to the people there was
 never a worthier man
 enter coriolanus in a gown of humility
 with menenius
 here he comes and in the gown of humility mark his
 behavior we are not to stay all together but to
 come by him where he stands by ones by twos and
 by threes he's to make his requests by
 particulars wherein every one of us has a single
 honour in giving him our own voices with our own
 tongues therefore follow me and i direct you how
 you shall go by him
all content content
 exeunt citizens
menenius o sir you are not right have you not known
 the worthiest men have done't
coriolanus what must i say
 i pray sir'plague upon't i cannot bring
 my tongue to such a pace'look sir my wounds
 i got them in my country's service when
 some certain of your brethren roar'd and ran
 from the noise of our own drums'
menenius o me the gods
 you must not speak of that you must desire them
 to think upon you
coriolanus think upon me hang em
 i would they would forget me like the virtues
 which our divines lose by em
menenius you'll mar all
 i'll leave you pray you speak to em i pray you
 in wholesome manner
 exit
coriolanus bid them wash their faces
 and keep their teeth clean
 reenter two of the citizens
 so here comes a brace
 reenter a third citizen
 you know the cause air of my standing here
third citizen we do sir tell us what hath brought you to't
coriolanus mine own desert
second citizen your own desert
coriolanus ay but not mine own desire
third citizen how not your own desire
coriolanus no sir'twas never my desire yet to trouble the
 poor with begging
third citizen you must think if we give you any thing we hope to
 gain by you
coriolanus well then i pray your price o the consulship
first citizen the price is to ask it kindly
coriolanus kindly sir i pray let me ha't i have wounds to
 show you which shall be yours in private your
 good voice sir what say you
second citizen you shall ha it worthy sir
coriolanus a match sir there's in all two worthy voices
 begged i have your alms adieu
third citizen but this is something odd
second citizen an twere to give againbut tis no matter
 exeunt the three citizens
 reenter two other citizens
coriolanus pray you now if it may stand with the tune of your
 voices that i may be consul i have here the
 customary gown
fourth citizen you have deserved nobly of your country and you
 have not deserved nobly
coriolanus your enigma
fourth citizen you have been a scourge to her enemies you have
 been a rod to her friends you have not indeed loved
 the common people
coriolanus you should account me the more virtuous that i have
 not been common in my love i will sir flatter my
 sworn brother the people to earn a dearer
 estimation of them tis a condition they account
 gentle and since the wisdom of their choice is
 rather to have my hat than my heart i will practise
 the insinuating nod and be off to them most
