 exit
 twelfth night
act iv
scene iii olivia's garden
 enter sebastian
sebastian this is the air that is the glorious sun
 this pearl she gave me i do feel't and see't
 and though tis wonder that enwraps me thus
 yet tis not madness where's antonio then
 i could not find him at the elephant
 yet there he was and there i found this credit
 that he did range the town to seek me out
 his counsel now might do me golden service
 for though my soul disputes well with my sense
 that this may be some error but no madness
 yet doth this accident and flood of fortune
 so far exceed all instance all discourse
 that i am ready to distrust mine eyes
 and wrangle with my reason that persuades me
 to any other trust but that i am mad
 or else the lady's mad yet if twere so
 she could not sway her house command her followers
 take and give back affairs and their dispatch
 with such a smooth discreet and stable bearing
 as i perceive she does there's something in't
 that is deceiveable but here the lady comes
 enter olivia and priest
olivia blame not this haste of mine if you mean well
 now go with me and with this holy man
 into the chantry by there before him
 and underneath that consecrated roof
 plight me the full assurance of your faith
 that my most jealous and too doubtful soul
 may live at peace he shall conceal it
 whiles you are willing it shall come to note
 what time we will our celebration keep
 according to my birth what do you say
sebastian i'll follow this good man and go with you
 and having sworn truth ever will be true
olivia then lead the way good father and heavens so shine
 that they may fairly note this act of mine
 exeunt

duke orsino belong you to the lady olivia friends
clown ay sir we are some of her trappings
duke orsino i know thee well how dost thou my good fellow
clown truly sir the better for my foes and the worse
 for my friends
duke orsino just the contrary the better for thy friends
clown no sir the worse
duke orsino how can that be
clown marry sir they praise me and make an ass of me
 now my foes tell me plainly i am an ass so that by
 my foes sir i profit in the knowledge of myself
 and by my friends i am abused so that
 conclusions to be as kisses if your four negatives
 make your two affirmatives why then the worse for
 my friends and the better for my foes
duke orsino why this is excellent
clown by my troth sir no though it please you to be
 one of my friends
duke orsino thou shalt not be the worse for me there's gold
clown but that it would be doubledealing sir i would
 you could make it another
duke orsino o you give me ill counsel
clown put your grace in your pocket sir for this once
 and let your flesh and blood obey it
duke orsino well i will be so much a sinner to be a
 doubledealer there's another
clown primo secundo tertio is a good play and the old
 saying is the third pays for all the triplex
 sir is a good tripping measure or the bells of
 saint bennet sir may put you in mind one two three
duke orsino you can fool no more money out of me at this throw
 if you will let your lady know i am here to speak
 with her and bring her along with you it may awake
 my bounty further
clown marry sir lullaby to your bounty till i come
 again i go sir but i would not have you to think
 that my desire of having is the sin of covetousness
 but as you say sir let your bounty take a nap i
 will awake it anon
 exit
viola here comes the man sir that did rescue me
 enter antonio and officers
duke orsino that face of his i do remember well
 yet when i saw it last it was besmear'd
 as black as vulcan in the smoke of war
 a bawbling vessel was he captain of
 for shallow draught and bulk unprizable
 with which such scathful grapple did he make
 with the most noble bottom of our fleet
 that very envy and the tongue of loss
 cried fame and honour on him what's the matter
first officer orsino this is that antonio
 that took the phoenix and her fraught from candy
 and this is he that did the tiger board
 when your young nephew titus lost his leg
 here in the streets desperate of shame and state
 in private brabble did we apprehend him
viola he did me kindness sir drew on my side
 but in conclusion put strange speech upon me
 i know not what twas but distraction
duke orsino notable pirate thou saltwater thief
 what foolish boldness brought thee to their mercies
 whom thou in terms so bloody and so dear
 hast made thine enemies
antonio orsino noble sir
 be pleased that i shake off these names you give me
 antonio never yet was thief or pirate
 though i confess on base and ground enough
 orsino's enemy a witchcraft drew me hither
 that most ingrateful boy there by your side
 from the rude sea's enraged and foamy mouth
 did i redeem a wreck past hope he was
 his life i gave him and did thereto add
 my love without retention or restraint
 all his in dedication for his sake
 did i expose myself pure for his love
 into the danger of this adverse town
 drew to defend him when he was beset
 where being apprehended his false cunning
 not meaning to partake with me in danger
 taught him to face me out of his acquaintance
 and grew a twenty years removed thing
 while one would wink denied me mine own purse
 which i had recommended to his use
 not half an hour before
viola how can this be
duke orsino when came he to this town
antonio today my lord and for three months before
 no interim not a minute's vacancy
 both day and night did we keep company
 enter olivia and attendants
