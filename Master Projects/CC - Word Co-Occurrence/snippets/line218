 stabs king claudius
all treason treason
king claudius o yet defend me friends i am but hurt
hamlet here thou incestuous murderous damned dane
 drink off this potion is thy union here
 follow my mother
 king claudius dies
laertes he is justly served
 it is a poison temper'd by himself
 exchange forgiveness with me noble hamlet
 mine and my father's death come not upon thee
 nor thine on me
 dies
hamlet heaven make thee free of it i follow thee
 i am dead horatio wretched queen adieu
 you that look pale and tremble at this chance
 that are but mutes or audience to this act
 had i but timeas this fell sergeant death
 is strict in his arresto i could tell you
 but let it be horatio i am dead
 thou livest report me and my cause aright
 to the unsatisfied
horatio never believe it
 i am more an antique roman than a dane
 here's yet some liquor left
hamlet as thou'rt a man
 give me the cup let go by heaven i'll have't
 o good horatio what a wounded name
 things standing thus unknown shall live behind me
 if thou didst ever hold me in thy heart
 absent thee from felicity awhile
 and in this harsh world draw thy breath in pain
 to tell my story
 march afar off and shot within
 what warlike noise is this
osric young fortinbras with conquest come from poland
 to the ambassadors of england gives
 this warlike volley
hamlet o i die horatio
 the potent poison quite o'ercrows my spirit
 i cannot live to hear the news from england
 but i do prophesy the election lights
 on fortinbras he has my dying voice
 so tell him with the occurrents more and less
 which have solicited the rest is silence
 dies
horatio now cracks a noble heart good night sweet prince
 and flights of angels sing thee to thy rest
 why does the drum come hither
 march within
 enter fortinbras the english ambassadors
 and others
prince fortinbras where is this sight
horatio what is it ye would see
 if aught of woe or wonder cease your search
prince fortinbras this quarry cries on havoc o proud death
 what feast is toward in thine eternal cell
 that thou so many princes at a shot
 so bloodily hast struck
first ambassador the sight is dismal
 and our affairs from england come too late
 the ears are senseless that should give us hearing
 to tell him his commandment is fulfill'd
 that rosencrantz and guildenstern are dead
 where should we have our thanks
horatio not from his mouth
 had it the ability of life to thank you
 he never gave commandment for their death
 but since so jump upon this bloody question
 you from the polack wars and you from england
 are here arrived give order that these bodies
 high on a stage be placed to the view
 and let me speak to the yet unknowing world
 how these things came about so shall you hear
 of carnal bloody and unnatural acts
 of accidental judgments casual slaughters
 of deaths put on by cunning and forced cause
 and in this upshot purposes mistook
 fall'n on the inventors reads all this can i
 truly deliver
prince fortinbras let us haste to hear it
 and call the noblest to the audience
 for me with sorrow i embrace my fortune
 i have some rights of memory in this kingdom
 which now to claim my vantage doth invite me
horatio of that i shall have also cause to speak
 and from his mouth whose voice will draw on more
 but let this same be presently perform'd
 even while men's minds are wild lest more mischance
 on plots and errors happen
prince fortinbras let four captains
 bear hamlet like a soldier to the stage
 for he was likely had he been put on
 to have proved most royally and for his passage
 the soldiers music and the rites of war
 speak loudly for him
 take up the bodies such a sight as this
 becomes the field but here shows much amiss
 go bid the soldiers shoot
 a dead march exeunt bearing off the dead
 bodies after which a peal of ordnance is shot off
