 the duke being at the rose within the parish
 saint lawrence poultney did of me demand
 what was the speech among the londoners
 concerning the french journey i replied
 men fear'd the french would prove perfidious
 to the king's danger presently the duke
 said twas the fear indeed and that he doubted
 twould prove the verity of certain words
 spoke by a holy monk that oft says he
 hath sent to me wishing me to permit
 john de la car my chaplain a choice hour
 to hear from him a matter of some moment
 whom after under the confession's seal
 he solemnly had sworn that what he spoke
 my chaplain to no creature living but
 to me should utter with demure confidence
 this pausingly ensued neither the king nor's heirs
 tell you the duke shall prosper bid him strive
 to gain the love o the commonalty the duke
 shall govern england'
queen katharine if i know you well
 you were the duke's surveyor and lost your office
 on the complaint o the tenants take good heed
 you charge not in your spleen a noble person
 and spoil your nobler soul i say take heed
 yes heartily beseech you
king henry viii let him on
 go forward
surveyor on my soul i'll speak but truth
 i told my lord the duke by the devil's illusions
 the monk might be deceived and that twas dangerous for him
 to ruminate on this so far until
 it forged him some design which being believed
 it was much like to do he answer'd tush
 it can do me no damage adding further
 that had the king in his last sickness fail'd
 the cardinal's and sir thomas lovell's heads
 should have gone off
king henry viii ha what so rank ah ha
 there's mischief in this man canst thou say further
surveyor i can my liege
king henry viii proceed
surveyor being at greenwich
 after your highness had reproved the duke
 about sir william blomer
king henry viii i remember
 of such a time being my sworn servant
 the duke retain'd him his but on what hence
surveyor if quoth he i for this had been committed
 as to the tower i thought i would have play'd
 the part my father meant to act upon
 the usurper richard who being at salisbury
 made suit to come in's presence which if granted
 as he made semblance of his duty would
 have put his knife to him'
king henry viii a giant traitor
cardinal wolsey now madam may his highness live in freedom
 and this man out of prison
queen katharine god mend all
king henry viii there's something more would out of thee what say'st
surveyor after the duke his father with the knife'
 he stretch'd him and with one hand on his dagger
 another spread on's breast mounting his eyes
 he did discharge a horrible oath whose tenor
 waswere he evil used he would outgo
 his father by as much as a performance
 does an irresolute purpose
king henry viii there's his period
 to sheathe his knife in us he is attach'd
 call him to present trial if he may
 find mercy in the law tis his if none
 let him not seek t of us by day and night
 he's traitor to the height

act i
scene iii an antechamber in the palace
 enter chamberlain and sands
chamberlain is't possible the spells of france should juggle
 men into such strange mysteries
sands new customs
 though they be never so ridiculous
 nay let em be unmanly yet are follow'd
chamberlain as far as i see all the good our english
 have got by the late voyage is but merely
 a fit or two o the face but they are shrewd ones
 for when they hold em you would swear directly
 their very noses had been counsellors
 to pepin or clotharius they keep state so
sands they have all new legs and lame ones one would take it
 that never saw em pace before the spavin
 or springhalt reign'd among em
chamberlain death my lord
 their clothes are after such a pagan cut too
 that sure they've worn out christendom
 enter lovell
 how now
 what news sir thomas lovell
lovell faith my lord
 i hear of none but the new proclamation
 that's clapp'd upon the courtgate
chamberlain what is't for
lovell the reformation of our travell'd gallants
 that fill the court with quarrels talk and tailors
chamberlain i'm glad tis there now i would pray our monsieurs
 to think an english courtier may be wise
 and never see the louvre
lovell they must either
 for so run the conditions leave those remnants
 of fool and feather that they got in france
 with all their honourable point of ignorance
 pertaining thereunto as fights and fireworks
 abusing better men than they can be
 out of a foreign wisdom renouncing clean
 the faith they have in tennis and tall stockings
 short blister'd breeches and those types of travel
 and understand again like honest men
 or pack to their old playfellows there i take it
 they may cum privilegio wear away
 the lag end of their lewdness and be laugh'd at
sands tis time to give em physic their diseases
 are grown so catching
chamberlain what a loss our ladies
 will have of these trim vanities
lovell ay marry
 there will be woe indeed lords the sly whoresons
 have got a speeding trick to lay down ladies
 a french song and a fiddle has no fellow
sands the devil fiddle em i am glad they are going
 for sure there's no converting of em now
 an honest country lord as i am beaten
 a long time out of play may bring his plainsong
 and have an hour of hearing and by'r lady
 held current music too
chamberlain well said lord sands
 your colt's tooth is not cast yet
sands no my lord
 nor shall not while i have a stump
chamberlain sir thomas
 whither were you agoing
lovell to the cardinal's
 your lordship is a guest too
chamberlain o tis true
 this night he makes a supper and a great one
 to many lords and ladies there will be
 the beauty of this kingdom i'll assure you
lovell that churchman bears a bounteous mind indeed
 a hand as fruitful as the land that feeds us
 his dews fall every where
chamberlain no doubt he's noble
 he had a black mouth that said other of him
sands he may my lord has wherewithal in him
 sparing would show a worse sin than ill doctrine
 men of his way should be most liberal
 they are set here for examples
chamberlain true they are so
 but few now give so great ones my barge stays
 your lordship shall along come good sir thomas
 we shall be late else which i would not be
 for i was spoke to with sir henry guildford
 this night to be comptrollers
sands i am your lordship's

 enter chamberlain sands and lovell
 the very thought of this fair company
 clapp'd wings to me
chamberlain you are young sir harry guildford
sands sir thomas lovell had the cardinal
 but half my lay thoughts in him some of these
 should find a running banquet ere they rested
 i think would better please em by my life
 they are a sweet society of fair ones
lovell o that your lordship were but now confessor
 to one or two of these
sands i would i were
 they should find easy penance
lovell faith how easy
sands as easy as a downbed would afford it
chamberlain sweet ladies will it please you sit sir harry
 place you that side i'll take the charge of this
 his grace is entering nay you must not freeze
 two women placed together makes cold weather
 my lord sands you are one will keep em waking
 pray sit between these ladies
sands by my faith
