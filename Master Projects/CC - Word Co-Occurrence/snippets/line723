surrey sharp enough
 lord for thy justice
cardinal wolsey aside the late queen's gentlewoman
 a knight's daughter
 to be her mistress mistress the queen's queen
 this candle burns not clear tis i must snuff it
 then out it goes what though i know her virtuous
 and well deserving yet i know her for
 a spleeny lutheran and not wholesome to
 our cause that she should lie i the bosom of
 our hardruled king again there is sprung up
 an heretic an arch one cranmer one
 hath crawl'd into the favour of the king
 and is his oracle
norfolk he is vex'd at something
surrey i would twere something that would fret the string
 the mastercord on's heart
 enter king henry viii reading of a schedule and lovell
suffolk the king the king
king henry viii what piles of wealth hath he accumulated
 to his own portion and what expense by the hour
 seems to flow from him how i the name of thrift
 does he rake this together now my lords
 saw you the cardinal
norfolk my lord we have
 stood here observing him some strange commotion
 is in his brain he bites his lip and starts
 stops on a sudden looks upon the ground
 then lays his finger on his temple straight
 springs out into fast gait then stops again
 strikes his breast hard and anon he casts
 his eye against the moon in most strange postures
 we have seen him set himself
king henry viii it may well be
 there is a mutiny in's mind this morning
 papers of state he sent me to peruse
 as i required and wot you what i found
 thereon my conscience put unwittingly
 forsooth an inventory thus importing
 the several parcels of his plate his treasure
 rich stuffs and ornaments of household which
 i find at such proud rate that it outspeaks
 possession of a subject
norfolk it's heaven's will
 some spirit put this paper in the packet
 to bless your eye withal
king henry viii if we did think
 his contemplation were above the earth
 and fix'd on spiritual object he should still
 dwell in his musings but i am afraid
 his thinkings are below the moon not worth
 his serious considering
 king henry viii takes his seat whispers lovell
 who goes to cardinal wolsey
cardinal wolsey heaven forgive me
 ever god bless your highness
king henry viii good my lord
 you are full of heavenly stuff and bear the inventory
 of your best graces in your mind the which
 you were now running o'er you have scarce time
 to steal from spiritual leisure a brief span
 to keep your earthly audit sure in that
 i deem you an ill husband and am glad
 to have you therein my companion
cardinal wolsey sir
 for holy offices i have a time a time
 to think upon the part of business which
 i bear i the state and nature does require
 her times of preservation which perforce
 i her frail son amongst my brethren mortal
 must give my tendence to
king henry viii you have said well
cardinal wolsey and ever may your highness yoke together
 as i will lend you cause my doing well
 with my well saying
king henry viii tis well said again
 and tis a kind of good deed to say well
 and yet words are no deeds my father loved you
 his said he did and with his deed did crown
 his word upon you since i had my office
 i have kept you next my heart have not alone
 employ'd you where high profits might come home
 but pared my present havings to bestow
 my bounties upon you
cardinal wolsey aside what should this mean
surrey aside the lord increase this business
king henry viii have i not made you
 the prime man of the state i pray you tell me
 if what i now pronounce you have found true
 and if you may confess it say withal
 if you are bound to us or no what say you
cardinal wolsey my sovereign i confess your royal graces
 shower'd on me daily have been more than could
 my studied purposes requite which went
 beyond all man's endeavours my endeavours
 have ever come too short of my desires
 yet filed with my abilities mine own ends
 have been mine so that evermore they pointed
 to the good of your most sacred person and
 the profit of the state for your great graces
 heap'd upon me poor undeserver i
 can nothing render but allegiant thanks
 my prayers to heaven for you my loyalty
 which ever has and ever shall be growing
 till death that winter kill it
king henry viii fairly answer'd
 a loyal and obedient subject is
 therein illustrated the honour of it
 does pay the act of it as i the contrary
 the foulness is the punishment i presume
 that as my hand has open'd bounty to you
 my heart dropp'd love my power rain'd honour more
 on you than any so your hand and heart
 your brain and every function of your power
 should notwithstanding that your bond of duty
 as twere in love's particular be more
 to me your friend than any
