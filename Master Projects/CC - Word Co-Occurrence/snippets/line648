 2 king henry iv
act ii
scene ii london another street
 enter prince henry and poins
prince henry before god i am exceeding weary
poins is't come to that i had thought weariness durst not
 have attached one of so high blood
prince henry faith it does me though it discolours the
 complexion of my greatness to acknowledge it doth
 it not show vilely in me to desire small beer
poins why a prince should not be so loosely studied as
 to remember so weak a composition
prince henry belike then my appetite was not princely got for
 by my troth i do now remember the poor creature
 small beer but indeed these humble
 considerations make me out of love with my
 greatness what a disgrace is it to me to remember
 thy name or to know thy face tomorrow or to
 take note how many pair of silk stockings thou
 hast viz these and those that were thy
 peachcoloured ones or to bear the inventory of thy
 shirts as one for superfluity and another for
 use but that the tenniscourtkeeper knows better
 than i for it is a low ebb of linen with thee when
 thou keepest not racket there as thou hast not done
 a great while because the rest of thy low
 countries have made a shift to eat up thy holland
 and god knows whether those that bawl out the ruins
 of thy linen shall inherit his kingdom but the
 midwives say the children are not in the fault
 whereupon the world increases and kindreds are
 mightily strengthened
poins how ill it follows after you have laboured so hard
 you should talk so idly tell me how many good
 young princes would do so their fathers being so
 sick as yours at this time is
prince henry shall i tell thee one thing poins
poins yes faith and let it be an excellent good thing
prince henry it shall serve among wits of no higher breeding than thine
poins go to i stand the push of your one thing that you
 will tell
prince henry marry i tell thee it is not meet that i should be
 sad now my father is sick albeit i could tell
 thee as to one it pleases me for fault of a
 better to call my friend i could be sad and sad
 indeed too
poins very hardly upon such a subject
prince henry by this hand thou thinkest me as far in the devil's
 book as thou and falstaff for obduracy and
 persistency let the end try the man but i tell
 thee my heart bleeds inwardly that my father is so
 sick and keeping such vile company as thou art
 hath in reason taken from me all ostentation of sorrow
poins the reason
prince henry what wouldst thou think of me if i should weep
poins i would think thee a most princely hypocrite
prince henry it would be every man's thought and thou art a
 blessed fellow to think as every man thinks never
 a man's thought in the world keeps the roadway
 better than thine every man would think me an
 hypocrite indeed and what accites your most
 worshipful thought to think so
poins why because you have been so lewd and so much
 engraffed to falstaff
prince henry and to thee
poins by this light i am well spoke on i can hear it
 with my own ears the worst that they can say of
 me is that i am a second brother and that i am a
 proper fellow of my hands and those two things i
 confess i cannot help by the mass here comes bardolph
 enter bardolph and page
prince henry and the boy that i gave falstaff a had him from
 me christian and look if the fat villain have not
 transformed him ape

 lattice and i could discern no part of his face

 new petticoat and so peeped through

bardolph away you whoreson upright rabbit away
page away you rascally althaea's dream away
prince henry instruct us boy what dream boy

 gallows shall have wrong

 town there's a letter for you

 martlemas your master
bardolph in bodily health sir
poins marry the immortal part needs a physician but
 that moves not him though that be sick it dies
 not
prince henry i do allow this wen to be as familiar with me as my
 dog and he holds his place for look you how be writes
poins reads john falstaff knight'every man must
 know that as oft as he has occasion to name
 himself even like those that are kin to the king
 for they never prick their finger but they say
 there's some of the king's blood spilt how
 comes that says he that takes upon him not to
 conceive the answer is as ready as a borrower's
