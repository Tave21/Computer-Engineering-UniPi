 when it was less expected he replied
 it was a bare petition of a state
 to one whom they had punish'd
menenius very well
 could he say less
cominius i offer'd to awaken his regard
 for's private friends his answer to me was
 he could not stay to pick them in a pile
 of noisome musty chaff he said twas folly
 for one poor grain or two to leave unburnt
 and still to nose the offence
menenius for one poor grain or two
 i am one of those his mother wife his child
 and this brave fellow too we are the grains
 you are the musty chaff and you are smelt
 above the moon we must be burnt for you
sicinius nay pray be patient if you refuse your aid
 in this so neverneeded help yet do not
 upbraid's with our distress but sure if you
 would be your country's pleader your good tongue
 more than the instant army we can make
 might stop our countryman
menenius no i'll not meddle
sicinius pray you go to him
menenius what should i do
brutus only make trial what your love can do
 for rome towards marcius
menenius well and say that marcius
 return me as cominius is return'd
 unheard what then
 but as a discontented friend griefshot
 with his unkindness say't be so
sicinius yet your good will
 must have that thanks from rome after the measure
 as you intended well
menenius i'll undertake t
 i think he'll hear me yet to bite his lip
 and hum at good cominius much unhearts me
 he was not taken well he had not dined
 the veins unfill'd our blood is cold and then
 we pout upon the morning are unapt
 to give or to forgive but when we have stuff'd
 these and these conveyances of our blood
 with wine and feeding we have suppler souls
 than in our priestlike fasts therefore i'll watch him
 till he be dieted to my request
 and then i'll set upon him
brutus you know the very road into his kindness
 and cannot lose your way
menenius good faith i'll prove him
 speed how it will i shall ere long have knowledge
 of my success
 exit
cominius he'll never hear him
sicinius not
cominius i tell you he does sit in gold his eye
 red as twould burn rome and his injury
 the gaoler to his pity i kneel'd before him
 twas very faintly he said rise dismiss'd me
 thus with his speechless hand what he would do
 he sent in writing after me what he would not
 bound with an oath to yield to his conditions
 so that all hope is vain
 unless his noble mother and his wife
 who as i hear mean to solicit him
 for mercy to his country therefore let's hence
 and with our fair entreaties haste them on

 coriolanus
act v
scene ii entrance of the volscian camp before rome
 two sentinels on guard
 enter to them menenius
first senator stay whence are you
second senator stand and go back
menenius you guard like men tis well but by your leave
 i am an officer of state and come
 to speak with coriolanus
first senator from whence
menenius from rome
first senator you may not pass you must return our general
 will no more hear from thence
second senator you'll see your rome embraced with fire before
 you'll speak with coriolanus
menenius good my friends
 if you have heard your general talk of rome
 and of his friends there it is lots to blanks
 my name hath touch'd your ears it is menenius
first senator be it so go back the virtue of your name
 is not here passable
menenius i tell thee fellow
 the general is my lover i have been
 the book of his good acts whence men have read
 his name unparallel'd haply amplified
 for i have ever verified my friends
 of whom he's chief with all the size that verity
 would without lapsing suffer nay sometimes
 like to a bowl upon a subtle ground
 i have tumbled past the throw and in his praise
 have almost stamp'd the leasing therefore fellow
 i must have leave to pass
first senator faith sir if you had told as many lies in his
 behalf as you have uttered words in your own you
 should not pass here no though it were as virtuous
 to lie as to live chastely therefore go back
menenius prithee fellow remember my name is menenius
 always factionary on the party of your general
second senator howsoever you have been his liar as you say you
 have i am one that telling true under him must
 say you cannot pass therefore go back
menenius has he dined canst thou tell for i would not
 speak with him till after dinner
first senator you are a roman are you
menenius i am as thy general is
first senator then you should hate rome as he does can you
 when you have pushed out your gates the very
 defender of them and in a violent popular
 ignorance given your enemy your shield think to
 front his revenges with the easy groans of old
 women the virginal palms of your daughters or with
 the palsied intercession of such a decayed dotant as
 you seem to be can you think to blow out the
 intended fire your city is ready to flame in with
 such weak breath as this no you are deceived
 therefore back to rome and prepare for your
 execution you are condemned our general has sworn
 you out of reprieve and pardon
menenius sirrah if thy captain knew i were here he would
 use me with estimation
second senator come my captain knows you not
menenius i mean thy general
first senator my general cares not for you back i say go lest
 i let forth your halfpint of blood backthat's
 the utmost of your having back
menenius nay but fellow fellow
 enter coriolanus and aufidius
coriolanus what's the matter
menenius now you companion i'll say an errand for you
 you shall know now that i am in estimation you shall
 perceive that a jack guardant cannot office me from
 my son coriolanus guess but by my entertainment
 with him if thou standest not i the state of
 hanging or of some death more long in
 spectatorship and crueller in suffering behold now
 presently and swoon for what's to come upon thee
 to coriolanus
 the glorious gods sit in hourly synod about thy
 particular prosperity and love thee no worse than
 thy old father menenius does o my son my son
 thou art preparing fire for us look thee here's
 water to quench it i was hardly moved to come to
 thee but being assured none but myself could move
 thee i have been blown out of your gates with
 sighs and conjure thee to pardon rome and thy
 petitionary countrymen the good gods assuage thy
 wrath and turn the dregs of it upon this varlet
 herethis who like a block hath denied my
 access to thee
coriolanus away
menenius how away
coriolanus wife mother child i know not my affairs
 are servanted to others though i owe
 my revenge properly my remission lies
 in volscian breasts that we have been familiar
 ingrate forgetfulness shall poison rather
 than pity note how much therefore be gone
 mine ears against your suits are stronger than
 your gates against my force yet for i loved thee
 take this along i writ it for thy sake
 gives a letter
 and would have rent it another word menenius
 i will not hear thee speak this man aufidius
 was my beloved in rome yet thou behold'st
aufidius you keep a constant temper
 exeunt coriolanus and aufidius
first senator now sir is your name menenius
second senator tis a spell you see of much power you know the
 way home again
first senator do you hear how we are shent for keeping your
 greatness back
second senator what cause do you think i have to swoon
menenius i neither care for the world nor your general for
 such things as you i can scarce think there's any
 ye're so slight he that hath a will to die by
 himself fears it not from another let your general
 do his worst for you be that you are long and
 your misery increase with your age i say to you
 as i was said to away
 exit
first senator a noble fellow i warrant him
second senator the worthy fellow is our general he's the rock the
 oak not to be windshaken
