 the two gentlemen of verona
act iii
scene ii the same the duke's palace
 enter duke and thurio
duke sir thurio fear not but that she will love you
 now valentine is banish'd from her sight
thurio since his exile she hath despised me most
 forsworn my company and rail'd at me
 that i am desperate of obtaining her
duke this weak impress of love is as a figure
 trenched in ice which with an hour's heat
 dissolves to water and doth lose his form
 a little time will melt her frozen thoughts
 and worthless valentine shall be forgot
 enter proteus
 how now sir proteus is your countryman
 according to our proclamation gone
proteus gone my good lord
duke my daughter takes his going grievously
proteus a little time my lord will kill that grief
duke so i believe but thurio thinks not so
 proteus the good conceit i hold of thee
 for thou hast shown some sign of good desert
 makes me the better to confer with thee
proteus longer than i prove loyal to your grace
 let me not live to look upon your grace
duke thou know'st how willingly i would effect
 the match between sir thurio and my daughter
proteus i do my lord
duke and also i think thou art not ignorant
 how she opposes her against my will
proteus she did my lord when valentine was here
duke ay and perversely she persevers so
 what might we do to make the girl forget
 the love of valentine and love sir thurio
proteus the best way is to slander valentine
 with falsehood cowardice and poor descent
 three things that women highly hold in hate
duke ay but she'll think that it is spoke in hate
proteus ay if his enemy deliver it
 therefore it must with circumstance be spoken
 by one whom she esteemeth as his friend
duke then you must undertake to slander him
proteus and that my lord i shall be loath to do
 tis an ill office for a gentleman
 especially against his very friend
duke where your good word cannot advantage him
 your slander never can endamage him
 therefore the office is indifferent
 being entreated to it by your friend
proteus you have prevail'd my lord if i can do it
 by ought that i can speak in his dispraise
 she shall not long continue love to him
 but say this weed her love from valentine
 it follows not that she will love sir thurio
thurio therefore as you unwind her love from him
 lest it should ravel and be good to none
 you must provide to bottom it on me
 which must be done by praising me as much
 as you in worth dispraise sir valentine
duke and proteus we dare trust you in this kind
 because we know on valentine's report
 you are already love's firm votary
 and cannot soon revolt and change your mind
 upon this warrant shall you have access
 where you with silvia may confer at large
 for she is lumpish heavy melancholy
 and for your friend's sake will be glad of you
 where you may temper her by your persuasion
 to hate young valentine and love my friend
proteus as much as i can do i will effect
 but you sir thurio are not sharp enough
 you must lay lime to tangle her desires
 by wailful sonnets whose composed rhymes
 should be fullfraught with serviceable vows
duke ay
 much is the force of heavenbred poesy
proteus say that upon the altar of her beauty
 you sacrifice your tears your sighs your heart
 write till your ink be dry and with your tears
 moist it again and frame some feeling line
 that may discover such integrity
 for orpheus lute was strung with poets sinews
 whose golden touch could soften steel and stones
 make tigers tame and huge leviathans
 forsake unsounded deeps to dance on sands
 after your direlamenting elegies
 visit by night your lady's chamberwindow
 with some sweet concert to their instruments
 tune a deploring dump the night's dead silence
 will well become such sweetcomplaining grievance
 this or else nothing will inherit her
duke this discipline shows thou hast been in love
thurio and thy advice this night i'll put in practise
 therefore sweet proteus my directiongiver
 let us into the city presently
 to sort some gentlemen well skill'd in music
 i have a sonnet that will serve the turn
 to give the onset to thy good advice
duke about it gentlemen
proteus we'll wait upon your grace till after supper
 and afterward determine our proceedings
duke even now about it i will pardon you
 exeunt
 the two gentlemen of verona
act iv
scene i the frontiers of mantua a forest
 enter certain outlaws
first outlaw fellows stand fast i see a passenger
second outlaw if there be ten shrink not but down with em
 enter valentine and speed
third outlaw stand sir and throw us that you have about ye
 if not we'll make you sit and rifle you
speed sir we are undone these are the villains
 that all the travellers do fear so much
valentine my friends
first outlaw that's not so sir we are your enemies
second outlaw peace we'll hear him
third outlaw ay by my beard will we for he's a proper man
valentine then know that i have little wealth to lose
 a man i am cross'd with adversity
 my riches are these poor habiliments
 of which if you should here disfurnish me
 you take the sum and substance that i have
second outlaw whither travel you
valentine to verona
first outlaw whence came you
valentine from milan
third outlaw have you long sojourned there
valentine some sixteen months and longer might have stay'd
 if crooked fortune had not thwarted me
first outlaw what were you banish'd thence
valentine i was
second outlaw for what offence
valentine for that which now torments me to rehearse
 i kill'd a man whose death i much repent
 but yet i slew him manfully in fight
 without false vantage or base treachery
first outlaw why ne'er repent it if it were done so
 but were you banish'd for so small a fault
valentine i was and held me glad of such a doom
second outlaw have you the tongues
valentine my youthful travel therein made me happy
 or else i often had been miserable
third outlaw by the bare scalp of robin hood's fat friar
 this fellow were a king for our wild faction
first outlaw we'll have him sirs a word
speed master be one of them it's an honourable kind of thievery
valentine peace villain
second outlaw tell us this have you any thing to take to
valentine nothing but my fortune
third outlaw know then that some of us are gentlemen
 such as the fury of ungovern'd youth
 thrust from the company of awful men
 myself was from verona banished
 for practising to steal away a lady
 an heir and near allied unto the duke
second outlaw and i from mantua for a gentleman
