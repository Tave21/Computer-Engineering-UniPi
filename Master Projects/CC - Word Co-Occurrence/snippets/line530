biondello nay by saint jamy
 i hold you a penny
 a horse and a man
 is more than one
 and yet not many
 enter petruchio and grumio
petruchio come where be these gallants who's at home
baptista you are welcome sir
petruchio and yet i come not well
baptista and yet you halt not
tranio not so well apparell'd
 as i wish you were
petruchio were it better i should rush in thus
 but where is kate where is my lovely bride
 how does my father gentles methinks you frown
 and wherefore gaze this goodly company
 as if they saw some wondrous monument
 some comet or unusual prodigy
baptista why sir you know this is your weddingday
 first were we sad fearing you would not come
 now sadder that you come so unprovided
 fie doff this habit shame to your estate
 an eyesore to our solemn festival
tranio and tells us what occasion of import
 hath all so long detain'd you from your wife
 and sent you hither so unlike yourself
petruchio tedious it were to tell and harsh to hear
 sufficeth i am come to keep my word
 though in some part enforced to digress
 which at more leisure i will so excuse
 as you shall well be satisfied withal
 but where is kate i stay too long from her
 the morning wears tis time we were at church
tranio see not your bride in these unreverent robes
 go to my chamber put on clothes of mine
petruchio not i believe me thus i'll visit her
baptista but thus i trust you will not marry her
petruchio good sooth even thus therefore ha done with words
 to me she's married not unto my clothes
 could i repair what she will wear in me
 as i can change these poor accoutrements
 twere well for kate and better for myself
 but what a fool am i to chat with you
 when i should bid good morrow to my bride
 and seal the title with a lovely kiss
 exeunt petruchio and grumio
tranio he hath some meaning in his mad attire
 we will persuade him be it possible
 to put on better ere he go to church
baptista i'll after him and see the event of this
 exeunt baptista gremio and attendants
tranio but to her love concerneth us to add
 her father's liking which to bring to pass
 as i before unparted to your worship
 i am to get a manwhate'er he be
 it skills not much we'll fit him to our turn
 and he shall be vincentio of pisa
 and make assurance here in padua
 of greater sums than i have promised
 so shall you quietly enjoy your hope
 and marry sweet bianca with consent
lucentio were it not that my fellowschoolmaster
 doth watch bianca's steps so narrowly
 twere good methinks to steal our marriage
 which once perform'd let all the world say no
 i'll keep mine own despite of all the world
tranio that by degrees we mean to look into
 and watch our vantage in this business
 we'll overreach the greybeard gremio
 the narrowprying father minola
 the quaint musician amorous licio
 all for my master's sake lucentio
 reenter gremio
 signior gremio came you from the church
gremio as willingly as e'er i came from school
tranio and is the bride and bridegroom coming home
gremio a bridegroom say you tis a groom indeed
 a grumbling groom and that the girl shall find
tranio curster than she why tis impossible
gremio why he's a devil a devil a very fiend
tranio why she's a devil a devil the devil's dam
gremio tut she's a lamb a dove a fool to him
 i'll tell you sir lucentio when the priest
 should ask if katharina should be his wife
 ay by gogswouns quoth he and swore so loud
 that allamazed the priest let fall the book
 and as he stoop'd again to take it up
 the madbrain'd bridegroom took him such a cuff
 that down fell priest and book and book and priest
 now take them up quoth he if any list'
tranio what said the wench when he rose again
gremio trembled and shook for why he stamp'd and swore
 as if the vicar meant to cozen him
 but after many ceremonies done
 he calls for wine a health quoth he as if
 he had been aboard carousing to his mates
 after a storm quaff'd off the muscadel
 and threw the sops all in the sexton's face
 having no other reason
 but that his beard grew thin and hungerly
 and seem'd to ask him sops as he was drinking
 this done he took the bride about the neck
 and kiss'd her lips with such a clamorous smack
 that at the parting all the church did echo
 and i seeing this came thence for very shame
 and after me i know the rout is coming
 such a mad marriage never was before
 hark hark i hear the minstrels play
 music
