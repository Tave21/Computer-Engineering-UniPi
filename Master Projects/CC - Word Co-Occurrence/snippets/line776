 tell me thou villain slave where are my children
duchess of york thou toad thou toad where is thy brother clarence
 and little ned plantagenet his son
queen elizabeth where is kind hastings rivers vaughan grey
king richard iii a flourish trumpets strike alarum drums
 let not the heavens hear these telltale women
 rail on the lord's enointed strike i say
 flourish alarums
 either be patient and entreat me fair
 or with the clamorous report of war
 thus will i drown your exclamations
duchess of york art thou my son
king richard iii ay i thank god my father and yourself
duchess of york then patiently hear my impatience
king richard iii madam i have a touch of your condition
 which cannot brook the accent of reproof
duchess of york o let me speak
king richard iii do then but i'll not hear
duchess of york i will be mild and gentle in my speech
king richard iii and brief good mother for i am in haste
duchess of york art thou so hasty i have stay'd for thee
 god knows in anguish pain and agony
king richard iii and came i not at last to comfort you
duchess of york no by the holy rood thou know'st it well
 thou camest on earth to make the earth my hell
 a grievous burthen was thy birth to me
 tetchy and wayward was thy infancy
 thy schooldays frightful desperate wild and furious
 thy prime of manhood daring bold and venturous
 thy age confirm'd proud subdued bloody
 treacherous
 more mild but yet more harmful kind in hatred
 what comfortable hour canst thou name
 that ever graced me in thy company
king richard iii faith none but humphrey hour that call'd
 your grace
 to breakfast once forth of my company
 if i be so disgracious in your sight
 let me march on and not offend your grace
 strike the drum
duchess of york i prithee hear me speak
king richard iii you speak too bitterly
duchess of york hear me a word
 for i shall never speak to thee again
king richard iii so
duchess of york either thou wilt die by god's just ordinance
 ere from this war thou turn a conqueror
 or i with grief and extreme age shall perish
 and never look upon thy face again
 therefore take with thee my most heavy curse
 which in the day of battle tire thee more
 than all the complete armour that thou wear'st
 my prayers on the adverse party fight
 and there the little souls of edward's children
 whisper the spirits of thine enemies
 and promise them success and victory
 bloody thou art bloody will be thy end
 shame serves thy life and doth thy death attend
 exit
queen elizabeth though far more cause yet much less spirit to curse
 abides in me i say amen to all
king richard iii stay madam i must speak a word with you
queen elizabeth i have no more sons of the royal blood
 for thee to murder for my daughters richard
 they shall be praying nuns not weeping queens
 and therefore level not to hit their lives
king richard iii you have a daughter call'd elizabeth
 virtuous and fair royal and gracious
queen elizabeth and must she die for this o let her live
 and i'll corrupt her manners stain her beauty
 slander myself as false to edward's bed
 throw over her the veil of infamy
 so she may live unscarr'd of bleeding slaughter
 i will confess she was not edward's daughter
king richard iii wrong not her birth she is of royal blood
queen elizabeth to save her life i'll say she is not so
king richard iii her life is only safest in her birth
queen elizabeth and only in that safety died her brothers
king richard iii lo at their births good stars were opposite
queen elizabeth no to their lives bad friends were contrary
king richard iii all unavoided is the doom of destiny
queen elizabeth true when avoided grace makes destiny
 my babes were destined to a fairer death
 if grace had bless'd thee with a fairer life
king richard iii you speak as if that i had slain my cousins
queen elizabeth cousins indeed and by their uncle cozen'd
 of comfort kingdom kindred freedom life
 whose hand soever lanced their tender hearts
 thy head all indirectly gave direction
 no doubt the murderous knife was dull and blunt
 till it was whetted on thy stonehard heart
 to revel in the entrails of my lambs
 but that still use of grief makes wild grief tame
 my tongue should to thy ears not name my boys
 till that my nails were anchor'd in thine eyes
 and i in such a desperate bay of death
 like a poor bark of sails and tackling reft
 rush all to pieces on thy rocky bosom
king richard iii madam so thrive i in my enterprise
 and dangerous success of bloody wars
 as i intend more good to you and yours
 than ever you or yours were by me wrong'd
queen elizabeth what good is cover'd with the face of heaven
 to be discover'd that can do me good
king richard iii the advancement of your children gentle lady
queen elizabeth up to some scaffold there to lose their heads
king richard iii no to the dignity and height of honour
 the high imperial type of this earth's glory
queen elizabeth flatter my sorrows with report of it
 tell me what state what dignity what honour
 canst thou demise to any child of mine
king richard iii even all i have yea and myself and all
 will i withal endow a child of thine
 so in the lethe of thy angry soul
 thou drown the sad remembrance of those wrongs
 which thou supposest i have done to thee
queen elizabeth be brief lest that be process of thy kindness
 last longer telling than thy kindness date
king richard iii then know that from my soul i love thy daughter
queen elizabeth my daughter's mother thinks it with her soul
king richard iii what do you think
queen elizabeth that thou dost love my daughter from thy soul
 so from thy soul's love didst thou love her brothers
 and from my heart's love i do thank thee for it
king richard iii be not so hasty to confound my meaning
 i mean that with my soul i love thy daughter
 and mean to make her queen of england
queen elizabeth say then who dost thou mean shall be her king
king richard iii even he that makes her queen who should be else
queen elizabeth what thou
king richard iii i even i what think you of it madam
queen elizabeth how canst thou woo her
king richard iii that would i learn of you
 as one that are best acquainted with her humour
queen elizabeth and wilt thou learn of me
king richard iii madam with all my heart
queen elizabeth send to her by the man that slew her brothers
 a pair of bleedinghearts thereon engrave
 edward and york then haply she will weep
 therefore present to heras sometime margaret
 did to thy father steep'd in rutland's blood
 a handkerchief which say to her did drain
 the purple sap from her sweet brother's body
 and bid her dry her weeping eyes therewith
 if this inducement force her not to love
 send her a story of thy noble acts
 tell her thou madest away her uncle clarence
 her uncle rivers yea and for her sake
 madest quick conveyance with her good aunt anne
king richard iii come come you mock me this is not the way
 to win our daughter
queen elizabeth there is no other way
 unless thou couldst put on some other shape
 and not be richard that hath done all this
king richard iii say that i did all this for love of her
queen elizabeth nay then indeed she cannot choose but hate thee
 having bought love with such a bloody spoil
king richard iii look what is done cannot be now amended
 men shall deal unadvisedly sometimes
 which after hours give leisure to repent
 if i did take the kingdom from your sons
 to make amends ill give it to your daughter
 if i have kill'd the issue of your womb
 to quicken your increase i will beget
 mine issue of your blood upon your daughter
 a grandam's name is little less in love
 than is the doting title of a mother
 they are as children but one step below
 even of your mettle of your very blood
 of an one pain save for a night of groans
 endured of her for whom you bid like sorrow
 your children were vexation to your youth
 but mine shall be a comfort to your age
 the loss you have is but a son being king
 and by that loss your daughter is made queen
 i cannot make you what amends i would
 therefore accept such kindness as i can
 dorset your son that with a fearful soul
 leads discontented steps in foreign soil
 this fair alliance quickly shall call home
 to high promotions and great dignity
 the king that calls your beauteous daughter wife
 familiarly shall call thy dorset brother
 again shall you be mother to a king
 and all the ruins of distressful times
 repair'd with double riches of content
 what we have many goodly days to see
 the liquid drops of tears that you have shed
 shall come again transform'd to orient pearl
 advantaging their loan with interest
 of ten times double gain of happiness
 go then my mother to thy daughter go
 make bold her bashful years with your experience
 prepare her ears to hear a wooer's tale
 put in her tender heart the aspiring flame
 of golden sovereignty acquaint the princess
 with the sweet silent hours of marriage joys
 and when this arm of mine hath chastised
 the petty rebel dullbrain'd buckingham
 bound with triumphant garlands will i come
