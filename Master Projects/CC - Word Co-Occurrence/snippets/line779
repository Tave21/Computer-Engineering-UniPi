 that i myself have done unto myself
 o no alas i rather hate myself
 for hateful deeds committed by myself
 i am a villain yet i lie i am not
 fool of thyself speak well fool do not flatter
 my conscience hath a thousand several tongues
 and every tongue brings in a several tale
 and every tale condemns me for a villain
 perjury perjury in the high'st degree
 murder stem murder in the direst degree
 all several sins all used in each degree
 throng to the bar crying all guilty guilty
 i shall despair there is no creature loves me
 and if i die no soul shall pity me
 nay wherefore should they since that i myself
 find in myself no pity to myself
 methought the souls of all that i had murder'd
 came to my tent and every one did threat
 tomorrow's vengeance on the head of richard
