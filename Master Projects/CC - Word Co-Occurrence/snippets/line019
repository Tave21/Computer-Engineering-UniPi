speak unto the children of israel when a man or woman shall commit any sin that men commit to do a trespass against the lord and that person be guilty
then they shall confess their sin which they have done and he shall recompense his trespass with the principal thereof and add unto it the fifth part thereof and give it unto him against whom he hath trespassed
but if the man have no kinsman to recompense the trespass unto let the trespass be recompensed unto the lord even to the priest beside the ram of the atonement whereby an atonement shall be made for him
and every offering of all the holy things of the children of israel which they bring unto the priest shall be his
and every man's hallowed things shall be his whatsoever any man giveth the priest it shall be his
and the lord spake unto moses saying
speak unto the children of israel and say unto them if any man's wife go aside and commit a trespass against him
and a man lie with her carnally and it be hid from the eyes of her husband and be kept close and she be defiled and there be no witness against her neither she be taken with the manner
and the spirit of jealousy come upon him and he be jealous of his wife and she be defiled or if the spirit of jealousy come upon him and he be jealous of his wife and she be not defiled
then shall the man bring his wife unto the priest and he shall bring her offering for her the tenth part of an ephah of barley meal he shall pour no oil upon it nor put frankincense thereon for it is an offering of jealousy an offering of memorial bringing iniquity to remembrance
and the priest shall bring her near and set her before the lord
and the priest shall take holy water in an earthen vessel and of the dust that is in the floor of the tabernacle the priest shall take and put it into the water
and the priest shall set the woman before the lord and uncover the woman's head and put the offering of memorial in her hands which is the jealousy offering and the priest shall have in his hand the bitter water that causeth the curse
and the priest shall charge her by an oath and say unto the woman if no man have lain with thee and if thou hast not gone aside to uncleanness with another instead of thy husband be thou free from this bitter water that causeth the curse
but if thou hast gone aside to another instead of thy husband and if thou be defiled and some man have lain with thee beside thine husband
then the priest shall charge the woman with an oath of cursing and the priest shall say unto the woman the lord make thee a curse and an oath among thy people when the lord doth make thy thigh to rot and thy belly to swell
and this water that causeth the curse shall go into thy bowels to make thy belly to swell and thy thigh to rot and the woman shall say amen amen
and the priest shall write these curses in a book and he shall blot them out with the bitter water
and he shall cause the woman to drink the bitter water that causeth the curse and the water that causeth the curse shall enter into her and become bitter
then the priest shall take the jealousy offering out of the woman's hand and shall wave the offering before the lord and offer it upon the altar
and the priest shall take an handful of the offering even the memorial thereof and burn it upon the altar and afterward shall cause the woman to drink the water
and when he hath made her to drink the water then it shall come to pass that if she be defiled and have done trespass against her husband that the water that causeth the curse shall enter into her and become bitter and her belly shall swell and her thigh shall rot and the woman shall be a curse among her people
and if the woman be not defiled but be clean then she shall be free and shall conceive seed
this is the law of jealousies when a wife goeth aside to another instead of her husband and is defiled
or when the spirit of jealousy cometh upon him and he be jealous over his wife and shall set the woman before the lord and the priest shall execute upon her all this law
then shall the man be guiltless from iniquity and this woman shall bear her iniquity
and the lord spake unto moses saying
speak unto the children of israel and say unto them when either man or woman shall separate themselves to vow a vow of a nazarite to separate themselves unto the lord
he shall separate himself from wine and strong drink and shall drink no vinegar of wine or vinegar of strong drink neither shall he drink any liquor of grapes nor eat moist grapes or dried
all the days of his separation shall he eat nothing that is made of the vine tree from the kernels even to the husk
all the days of the vow of his separation there shall no razor come upon his head until the days be fulfilled in the which he separateth himself unto the lord he shall be holy and shall let the locks of the hair of his head grow
all the days that he separateth himself unto the lord he shall come at no dead body
he shall not make himself unclean for his father or for his mother for his brother or for his sister when they die because the consecration of his god is upon his head
all the days of his separation he is holy unto the lord
and if any man die very suddenly by him and he hath defiled the head of his consecration then he shall shave his head in the day of his cleansing on the seventh day shall he shave it
and on the eighth day he shall bring two turtles or two young pigeons to the priest to the door of the tabernacle of the congregation
and the priest shall offer the one for a sin offering and the other for a burnt offering and make an atonement for him for that he sinned by the dead and shall hallow his head that same day
and he shall consecrate unto the lord the days of his separation and shall bring a lamb of the first year for a trespass offering but the days that were before shall be lost because his separation was defiled
and this is the law of the nazarite when the days of his separation are fulfilled he shall be brought unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation
and he shall offer his offering unto the lord one he lamb of the first year without blemish for a burnt offering and one ewe lamb of the first year without blemish for a sin offering and one ram without blemish for peace offerings
and a basket of unleavened bread cakes of fine flour mingled with oil and wafers of unleavened bread anointed with oil and their meat offering and their drink offerings
and the priest shall bring them before the lord and shall offer his sin offering and his burnt offering
and he shall offer the ram for a sacrifice of peace offerings unto the lord with the basket of unleavened bread the priest shall offer also his meat offering and his drink offering
and the nazarite shall shave the head of his separation at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation and shall take the hair of the head of his separation and put it in the fire which is under the sacrifice of the peace offerings
and the priest shall take the sodden shoulder of the ram and one unleavened cake out of the basket and one unleavened wafer and shall put them upon the hands of the nazarite after the hair of his separation is shaven
and the priest shall wave them for a wave offering before the lord this is holy for the priest with the wave breast and heave shoulder and after that the nazarite may drink wine
this is the law of the nazarite who hath vowed and of his offering unto the lord for his separation beside that that his hand shall get according to the vow which he vowed so he must do after the law of his separation
and the lord spake unto moses saying
speak unto aaron and unto his sons saying on this wise ye shall bless the children of israel saying unto them
the lord bless thee and keep thee
the lord make his face shine upon thee and be gracious unto thee
the lord lift up his countenance upon thee and give thee peace
and they shall put my name upon the children of israel and i will bless them

and when moses was gone into the tabernacle of the congregation to speak with him then he heard the voice of one speaking unto him from off the mercy seat that was upon the ark of testimony from between the two cherubims and he spake unto him
and the lord spake unto moses saying
speak unto aaron and say unto him when thou lightest the lamps the seven lamps shall give light over against the candlestick
and aaron did so he lighted the lamps thereof over against the candlestick as the lord commanded moses
and this work of the candlestick was of beaten gold unto the shaft thereof unto the flowers thereof was beaten work according unto the pattern which the lord had shewed moses so he made the candlestick
and the lord spake unto moses saying
take the levites from among the children of israel and cleanse them
and thus shalt thou do unto them to cleanse them sprinkle water of purifying upon them and let them shave all their flesh and let them wash their clothes and so make themselves clean
then let them take a young bullock with his meat offering even fine flour mingled with oil and another young bullock shalt thou take for a sin offering
and thou shalt bring the levites before the tabernacle of the congregation and thou shalt gather the whole assembly of the children of israel together
and thou shalt bring the levites before the lord and the children of israel shall put their hands upon the levites
and aaron shall offer the levites before the lord for an offering of the children of israel that they may execute the service of the lord
and the levites shall lay their hands upon the heads of the bullocks and thou shalt offer the one for a sin offering and the other for a burnt offering unto the lord to make an atonement for the levites
and thou shalt set the levites before aaron and before his sons and offer them for an offering unto the lord
thus shalt thou separate the levites from among the children of israel and the levites shall be mine
and after that shall the levites go in to do the service of the tabernacle of the congregation and thou shalt cleanse them and offer them for an offering
for they are wholly given unto me from among the children of israel instead of such as open every womb even instead of the firstborn of all the children of israel have i taken them unto me
for all the firstborn of the children of israel are mine both man and beast on the day that i smote every firstborn in the land of egypt i sanctified them for myself
and i have taken the levites for all the firstborn of the children of israel
and i have given the levites as a gift to aaron and to his sons from among the children of israel to do the service of the children of israel in the tabernacle of the congregation and to make an atonement for the children of israel that there be no plague among the children of israel when the children of israel come nigh unto the sanctuary
and moses and aaron and all the congregation of the children of israel did to the levites according unto all that the lord commanded moses concerning the levites so did the children of israel unto them
and the levites were purified and they washed their clothes and aaron offered them as an offering before the lord and aaron made an atonement for them to cleanse them
and after that went the levites in to do their service in the tabernacle of the congregation before aaron and before his sons as the lord had commanded moses concerning the levites so did they unto them
and the lord spake unto moses saying
this is it that belongeth unto the levites from twenty and five years old and upward they shall go in to wait upon the service of the tabernacle of the congregation
and from the age of fifty years they shall cease waiting upon the service thereof and shall serve no more
but shall minister with their brethren in the tabernacle of the congregation to keep the charge and shall do no service thus shalt thou do unto the levites touching their charge
and the lord spake unto moses in the wilderness of sinai in the first month of the second year after they were come out of the land of egypt saying
let the children of israel also keep the passover at his appointed season
in the fourteenth day of this month at even ye shall keep it in his appointed season according to all the rites of it and according to all the ceremonies thereof shall ye keep it
and moses spake unto the children of israel that they should keep the passover
and they kept the passover on the fourteenth day of the first month at even in the wilderness of sinai according to all that the lord commanded moses so did the children of israel
and there were certain men who were defiled by the dead body of a man that they could not keep the passover on that day and they came before moses and before aaron on that day
and those men said unto him we are defiled by the dead body of a man wherefore are we kept back that we may not offer an offering of the lord in his appointed season among the children of israel
and moses said unto them stand still and i will hear what the lord will command concerning you
and the lord spake unto moses saying
speak unto the children of israel saying if any man of you or of your posterity shall be unclean by reason of a dead body or be in a journey afar off yet he shall keep the passover unto the lord
the fourteenth day of the second month at even they shall keep it and eat it with unleavened bread and bitter herbs
they shall leave none of it unto the morning nor break any bone of it according to all the ordinances of the passover they shall keep it
but the man that is clean and is not in a journey and forbeareth to keep the passover even the same soul shall be cut off from among his people because he brought not the offering of the lord in his appointed season that man shall bear his sin
and if a stranger shall sojourn among you and will keep the passover unto the lord according to the ordinance of the passover and according to the manner thereof so shall he do ye shall have one ordinance both for the stranger and for him that was born in the land
and on the day that the tabernacle was reared up the cloud covered the tabernacle namely the tent of the testimony and at even there was upon the tabernacle as it were the appearance of fire until the morning
so it was alway the cloud covered it by day and the appearance of fire by night
and when the cloud was taken up from the tabernacle then after that the children of israel journeyed and in the place where the cloud abode there the children of israel pitched their tents
at the commandment of the lord the children of israel journeyed and at the commandment of the lord they pitched as long as the cloud abode upon the tabernacle they rested in their tents
and when the cloud tarried long upon the tabernacle many days then the children of israel kept the charge of the lord and journeyed not
and so it was when the cloud was a few days upon the tabernacle according to the commandment of the lord they abode in their tents and according to the commandment of the lord they journeyed
and so it was when the cloud abode from even unto the morning and that the cloud was taken up in the morning then they journeyed whether it was by day or by night that the cloud was taken up they journeyed
or whether it were two days or a month or a year that the cloud tarried upon the tabernacle remaining thereon the children of israel abode in their tents and journeyed not but when it was taken up they journeyed
at the commandment of the lord they rested in the tents and at the commandment of the lord they journeyed they kept the charge of the lord at the commandment of the lord by the hand of moses
and the lord spake unto moses saying
make thee two trumpets of silver of a whole piece shalt thou make them that thou mayest use them for the calling of the assembly and for the journeying of the camps
and when they shall blow with them all the assembly shall assemble themselves to thee at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation
and if they blow but with one trumpet then the princes which are heads of the thousands of israel shall gather themselves unto thee
when ye blow an alarm then the camps that lie on the east parts shall go forward
when ye blow an alarm the second time then the camps that lie on the south side shall take their journey they shall blow an alarm for their journeys
but when the congregation is to be gathered together ye shall blow but ye shall not sound an alarm
and the sons of aaron the priests shall blow with the trumpets and they shall be to you for an ordinance for ever throughout your generations
and if ye go to war in your land against the enemy that oppresseth you then ye shall blow an alarm with the trumpets and ye shall be remembered before the lord your god and ye shall be saved from your enemies
