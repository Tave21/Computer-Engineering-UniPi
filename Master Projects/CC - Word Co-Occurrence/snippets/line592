 the air hath starved the roses in her cheeks
 and pinch'd the lilytincture of her face
 that now she is become as black as i
silvia how tall was she
julia about my stature for at pentecost
 when all our pageants of delight were play'd
 our youth got me to play the woman's part
 and i was trimm'd in madam julia's gown
 which served me as fit by all men's judgments
 as if the garment had been made for me
 therefore i know she is about my height
 and at that time i made her weep agood
 for i did play a lamentable part
 madam twas ariadne passioning
 for theseus perjury and unjust flight
 which i so lively acted with my tears
 that my poor mistress moved therewithal
 wept bitterly and would i might be dead
 if i in thought felt not her very sorrow
silvia she is beholding to thee gentle youth
 alas poor lady desolate and left
 i weep myself to think upon thy words
 here youth there is my purse i give thee this
 for thy sweet mistress sake because thou lovest her
 farewell
 exit silvia with attendants
julia and she shall thank you for't if e'er you know her
 a virtuous gentlewoman mild and beautiful
 i hope my master's suit will be but cold
 since she respects my mistress love so much
 alas how love can trifle with itself
 here is her picture let me see i think
 if i had such a tire this face of mine
 were full as lovely as is this of hers
 and yet the painter flatter'd her a little
 unless i flatter with myself too much
 her hair is auburn mine is perfect yellow
 if that be all the difference in his love
 i'll get me such a colour'd periwig
 her eyes are grey as glass and so are mine
 ay but her forehead's low and mine's as high
 what should it be that he respects in her
 but i can make respective in myself
 if this fond love were not a blinded god
 come shadow come and take this shadow up
 for tis thy rival o thou senseless form
 thou shalt be worshipp'd kiss'd loved and adored
 and were there sense in his idolatry
 my substance should be statue in thy stead
 i'll use thee kindly for thy mistress sake
 that used me so or else by jove i vow
 i should have scratch'd out your unseeing eyes
 to make my master out of love with thee

scene i milan an abbey
 enter eglamour
eglamour the sun begins to gild the western sky
 and now it is about the very hour
 that silvia at friar patrick's cell should meet me
 she will not fail for lovers break not hours
 unless it be to come before their time
 so much they spur their expedition
 see where she comes
 enter silvia
 lady a happy evening
silvia amen amen go on good eglamour
 out at the postern by the abbeywall
 i fear i am attended by some spies
eglamour fear not the forest is not three leagues off
 if we recover that we are sure enough

act v
scene ii the same the duke's palace
 enter thurio proteus and julia
thurio sir proteus what says silvia to my suit
proteus o sir i find her milder than she was
 and yet she takes exceptions at your person
thurio what that my leg is too long
proteus no that it is too little
thurio i'll wear a boot to make it somewhat rounder
julia aside but love will not be spurr'd to what
 it loathes
thurio what says she to my face
proteus she says it is a fair one
thurio nay then the wanton lies my face is black
proteus but pearls are fair and the old saying is
 black men are pearls in beauteous ladies eyes
julia aside tis true such pearls as put out
 ladies eyes
 for i had rather wink than look on them
thurio how likes she my discourse
proteus ill when you talk of war
thurio but well when i discourse of love and peace
julia aside but better indeed when you hold your peace
thurio what says she to my valour
proteus o sir she makes no doubt of that
julia aside she needs not when she knows it cowardice
thurio what says she to my birth
proteus that you are well derived
julia aside true from a gentleman to a fool
thurio considers she my possessions
proteus o ay and pities them
thurio wherefore
julia aside that such an ass should owe them
proteus that they are out by lease
julia here comes the duke
 enter duke
duke how now sir proteus how now thurio
 which of you saw sir eglamour of late
thurio not i
proteus nor i
duke saw you my daughter
proteus neither
duke why then
 she's fled unto that peasant valentine
 and eglamour is in her company
 tis true for friar laurence met them both
 as he in penance wander'd through the forest
 him he knew well and guess'd that it was she
 but being mask'd he was not sure of it
 besides she did intend confession
 at patrick's cell this even and there she was not
 these likelihoods confirm her flight from hence
 therefore i pray you stand not to discourse
 but mount you presently and meet with me
 upon the rising of the mountainfoot
 that leads towards mantua whither they are fled
 dispatch sweet gentlemen and follow me
 exit
thurio why this it is to be a peevish girl
 that flies her fortune when it follows her
 i'll after more to be revenged on eglamour
 than for the love of reckless silvia
 exit
proteus and i will follow more for silvia's love
 than hate of eglamour that goes with her
 exit
julia and i will follow more to cross that love
 than hate for silvia that is gone for love

act v
scene iii the frontiers of mantua the forest
 enter outlaws with silvia
first outlaw come come
 be patient we must bring you to our captain
silvia a thousand more mischances than this one
 have learn'd me how to brook this patiently
second outlaw come bring her away
first outlaw where is the gentleman that was with her
third outlaw being nimblefooted he hath outrun us
 but moyses and valerius follow him
 go thou with her to the west end of the wood
 there is our captain we'll follow him that's fled
 the thicket is beset he cannot scape
first outlaw come i must bring you to our captain's cave
 fear not he bears an honourable mind
 and will not use a woman lawlessly
silvia o valentine this i endure for thee
 exeunt
 the two gentlemen of verona
act v
scene iv another part of the forest
 enter valentine
valentine how use doth breed a habit in a man
 this shadowy desert unfrequented woods
 i better brook than flourishing peopled towns
 here can i sit alone unseen of any
 and to the nightingale's complaining notes
 tune my distresses and record my woes
 o thou that dost inhabit in my breast
 leave not the mansion so long tenantless
 lest growing ruinous the building fall
 and leave no memory of what it was
 repair me with thy presence silvia
 thou gentle nymph cherish thy forlorn swain
 what halloing and what stir is this today
 these are my mates that make their wills their law
 have some unhappy passenger in chase
 they love me well yet i have much to do
 to keep them from uncivil outrages
 withdraw thee valentine who's this comes here
 enter proteus silvia and julia
proteus madam this service i have done for you
 though you respect not aught your servant doth
 to hazard life and rescue you from him
 that would have forced your honour and your love
 vouchsafe me for my meed but one fair look
 a smaller boon than this i cannot beg
 and less than this i am sure you cannot give
valentine aside how like a dream is this i see and hear
 love lend me patience to forbear awhile
silvia o miserable unhappy that i am
proteus unhappy were you madam ere i came
 but by my coming i have made you happy
silvia by thy approach thou makest me most unhappy
julia aside and me when he approacheth to your presence
