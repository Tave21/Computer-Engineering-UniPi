 reenter hostess
hostess as ever you came of women come in quickly to sir
 john ah poor heart he is so shaked of a burning
 quotidian tertian that it is most lamentable to
 behold sweet men come to him
nym the king hath run bad humours on the knight that's
 the even of it

 king henry v
act ii
scene ii southampton a councilchamber
 enter exeter bedford and westmoreland
bedford fore god his grace is bold to trust these traitors
exeter they shall be apprehended by and by
westmoreland how smooth and even they do bear themselves
 as if allegiance in their bosoms sat
 crowned with faith and constant loyalty
bedford the king hath note of all that they intend
 by interception which they dream not of
exeter nay but the man that was his bedfellow
 whom he hath dull'd and cloy'd with gracious favours
 that he should for a foreign purse so sell
 his sovereign's life to death and treachery
 trumpets sound enter king henry v scroop
 cambridge grey and attendants
king henry v now sits the wind fair and we will aboard
 my lord of cambridge and my kind lord of masham
 and you my gentle knight give me your thoughts
 think you not that the powers we bear with us
 will cut their passage through the force of france
 doing the execution and the act
 for which we have in head assembled them
scroop no doubt my liege if each man do his best
king henry v i doubt not that since we are well persuaded
 we carry not a heart with us from hence
 that grows not in a fair consent with ours
 nor leave not one behind that doth not wish
 success and conquest to attend on us
cambridge never was monarch better fear'd and loved
 than is your majesty there's not i think a subject
 that sits in heartgrief and uneasiness
 under the sweet shade of your government
grey true those that were your father's enemies
 have steep'd their galls in honey and do serve you
 with hearts create of duty and of zeal
king henry v we therefore have great cause of thankfulness
 and shall forget the office of our hand
 sooner than quittance of desert and merit
 according to the weight and worthiness
scroop so service shall with steeled sinews toil
 and labour shall refresh itself with hope
 to do your grace incessant services
king henry v we judge no less uncle of exeter
 enlarge the man committed yesterday
 that rail'd against our person we consider
 it was excess of wine that set him on
 and on his more advice we pardon him
scroop that's mercy but too much security
 let him be punish'd sovereign lest example
 breed by his sufferance more of such a kind
king henry v o let us yet be merciful
cambridge so may your highness and yet punish too
grey sir
 you show great mercy if you give him life
 after the taste of much correction
king henry v alas your too much love and care of me
 are heavy orisons gainst this poor wretch
 if little faults proceeding on distemper
 shall not be wink'd at how shall we stretch our eye
 when capital crimes chew'd swallow'd and digested
 appear before us we'll yet enlarge that man
 though cambridge scroop and grey in their dear care
 and tender preservation of our person
 would have him punished and now to our french causes
 who are the late commissioners
cambridge i one my lord
 your highness bade me ask for it today
scroop so did you me my liege
grey and i my royal sovereign
king henry v then richard earl of cambridge there is yours
 there yours lord scroop of masham and sir knight
 grey of northumberland this same is yours
 read them and know i know your worthiness
 my lord of westmoreland and uncle exeter
 we will aboard to night why how now gentlemen
 what see you in those papers that you lose
 so much complexion look ye how they change
 their cheeks are paper why what read you there
 that hath so cowarded and chased your blood
 out of appearance
cambridge i do confess my fault
 and do submit me to your highness mercy
grey 
 to which we all appeal
scroop 
king henry v the mercy that was quick in us but late
 by your own counsel is suppress'd and kill'd
 you must not dare for shame to talk of mercy
 for your own reasons turn into your bosoms
 as dogs upon their masters worrying you
 see you my princes and my noble peers
 these english monsters my lord of cambridge here
 you know how apt our love was to accord
 to furnish him with all appertinents
 belonging to his honour and this man
 hath for a few light crowns lightly conspired
 and sworn unto the practises of france
 to kill us here in hampton to the which
 this knight no less for bounty bound to us
 than cambridge is hath likewise sworn but o
 what shall i say to thee lord scroop thou cruel
 ingrateful savage and inhuman creature
 thou that didst bear the key of all my counsels
 that knew'st the very bottom of my soul
 that almost mightst have coin'd me into gold
 wouldst thou have practised on me for thy use
 may it be possible that foreign hire
 could out of thee extract one spark of evil
 that might annoy my finger tis so strange
 that though the truth of it stands off as gross
 as black and white my eye will scarcely see it
 treason and murder ever kept together
 as two yokedevils sworn to either's purpose
 working so grossly in a natural cause
 that admiration did not whoop at them
 but thou gainst all proportion didst bring in
 wonder to wait on treason and on murder
 and whatsoever cunning fiend it was
 that wrought upon thee so preposterously
 hath got the voice in hell for excellence
 all other devils that suggest by treasons
 do botch and bungle up damnation
 with patches colours and with forms being fetch'd
 from glistering semblances of piety
 but he that temper'd thee bade thee stand up
 gave thee no instance why thou shouldst do treason
 unless to dub thee with the name of traitor
 if that same demon that hath gull'd thee thus
 should with his lion gait walk the whole world
 he might return to vasty tartar back
 and tell the legions i can never win
 a soul so easy as that englishman's'
 o how hast thou with jealousy infected
 the sweetness of affiance show men dutiful
 why so didst thou seem they grave and learned
 why so didst thou come they of noble family
 why so didst thou seem they religious
 why so didst thou or are they spare in diet
 free from gross passion or of mirth or anger
 constant in spirit not swerving with the blood
 garnish'd and deck'd in modest complement
 not working with the eye without the ear
 and but in purged judgment trusting neither
 such and so finely bolted didst thou seem
 and thus thy fall hath left a kind of blot
 to mark the fullfraught man and best indued
 with some suspicion i will weep for thee
 for this revolt of thine methinks is like
 another fall of man their faults are open
 arrest them to the answer of the law
 and god acquit them of their practises
exeter i arrest thee of high treason by the name of
 richard earl of cambridge
 i arrest thee of high treason by the name of
 henry lord scroop of masham
 i arrest thee of high treason by the name of
 thomas grey knight of northumberland
scroop our purposes god justly hath discover'd
 and i repent my fault more than my death
 which i beseech your highness to forgive
 although my body pay the price of it
cambridge for me the gold of france did not seduce
 although i did admit it as a motive
 the sooner to effect what i intended
 but god be thanked for prevention
 which i in sufferance heartily will rejoice
 beseeching god and you to pardon me
grey never did faithful subject more rejoice
 at the discovery of most dangerous treason
 than i do at this hour joy o'er myself
 prevented from a damned enterprise
 my fault but not my body pardon sovereign
