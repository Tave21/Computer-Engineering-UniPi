 all sirrah all
 i'll once more feast the rascals
flavius o my lord
 you only speak from your distracted soul
 there is not so much left to furnish out
 a moderate table
timon be't not in thy care go
 i charge thee invite them all let in the tide
 of knaves once more my cook and i'll provide

act iii
scene v the same the senatehouse the senate sitting
first senator my lord you have my voice to it the fault's
 bloody tis necessary he should die
 nothing emboldens sin so much as mercy
second senator most true the law shall bruise him
 enter alcibiades with attendants
alcibiades honour health and compassion to the senate
first senator now captain
alcibiades i am an humble suitor to your virtues
 for pity is the virtue of the law
 and none but tyrants use it cruelly
 it pleases time and fortune to lie heavy
 upon a friend of mine who in hot blood
 hath stepp'd into the law which is past depth
 to those that without heed do plunge into t
 he is a man setting his fate aside
 of comely virtues
 nor did he soil the fact with cowardice
 an honour in him which buys out his fault
 but with a noble fury and fair spirit
 seeing his reputation touch'd to death
 he did oppose his foe
 and with such sober and unnoted passion
 he did behave his anger ere twas spent
 as if he had but proved an argument
first senator you undergo too strict a paradox
 striving to make an ugly deed look fair
 your words have took such pains as if they labour'd
 to bring manslaughter into form and set quarrelling
 upon the head of valour which indeed
 is valour misbegot and came into the world
 when sects and factions were newly born
 he's truly valiant that can wisely suffer
 the worst that man can breathe and make his wrongs
 his outsides to wear them like his raiment
 carelessly
 and ne'er prefer his injuries to his heart
 to bring it into danger
 if wrongs be evils and enforce us kill
 what folly tis to hazard life for ill
alcibiades my lord
first senator you cannot make gross sins look clear
 to revenge is no valour but to bear
alcibiades my lords then under favour pardon me
 if i speak like a captain
 why do fond men expose themselves to battle
 and not endure all threats sleep upon't
 and let the foes quietly cut their throats
 without repugnancy if there be
 such valour in the bearing what make we
 abroad why then women are more valiant
 that stay at home if bearing carry it
 and the ass more captain than the lion the felon
 loaden with irons wiser than the judge
 if wisdom be in suffering o my lords
 as you are great be pitifully good
 who cannot condemn rashness in cold blood
 to kill i grant is sin's extremest gust
 but in defence by mercy tis most just
 to be in anger is impiety
 but who is man that is not angry
 weigh but the crime with this
second senator you breathe in vain
alcibiades in vain his service done
 at lacedaemon and byzantium
 were a sufficient briber for his life
first senator what's that
alcibiades i say my lords he has done fair service
 and slain in fight many of your enemies
 how full of valour did he bear himself
 in the last conflict and made plenteous wounds
second senator he has made too much plenty with em
 he's a sworn rioter he has a sin that often
 drowns him and takes his valour prisoner
 if there were no foes that were enough
 to overcome him in that beastly fury
 he has been known to commit outrages
 and cherish factions tis inferr'd to us
 his days are foul and his drink dangerous
first senator he dies
alcibiades hard fate he might have died in war
 my lords if not for any parts in him
 though his right arm might purchase his own time
 and be in debt to noneyet more to move you
 take my deserts to his and join em both
 and for i know your reverend ages love
 security i'll pawn my victories all
 my honours to you upon his good returns
 if by this crime he owes the law his life
 why let the war receive t in valiant gore
 for law is strict and war is nothing more
first senator we are for law he dies urge it no more
 on height of our displeasure friend or brother
 he forfeits his own blood that spills another
alcibiades must it be so it must not be my lords
 i do beseech you know me
second senator how
alcibiades call me to your remembrances
third senator what
alcibiades i cannot think but your age has forgot me
 it could not else be i should prove so base
 to sue and be denied such common grace
 my wounds ache at you
first senator do you dare our anger
 tis in few words but spacious in effect
 we banish thee for ever
alcibiades banish me
 banish your dotage banish usury
 that makes the senate ugly
first senator if after two days shine athens contain thee
 attend our weightier judgment and not to swell
 our spirit
 he shall be executed presently
 exeunt senators
alcibiades now the gods keep you old enough that you may live
 only in bone that none may look on you
 i'm worse than mad i have kept back their foes
 while they have told their money and let out
 their coin upon large interest i myself
 rich only in large hurts all those for this
 is this the balsam that the usuring senate
 pours into captains wounds banishment
 it comes not ill i hate not to be banish'd
 it is a cause worthy my spleen and fury
 that i may strike at athens i'll cheer up
 my discontented troops and lay for hearts
 tis honour with most lands to be at odds
 soldiers should brook as little wrongs as gods

act iii
scene vi the same a banquetingroom in timon's house
 music tables set out servants attending
 enter divers lords senators and others at
 several doors
first lord the good time of day to you sir
second lord i also wish it to you i think this honourable lord
 did but try us this other day
first lord upon that were my thoughts tiring when we
 encountered i hope it is not so low with him as
 he made it seem in the trial of his several friends
second lord it should not be by the persuasion of his new feasting
first lord i should think so he hath sent me an earnest
 inviting which many my near occasions did urge me
 to put off but he hath conjured me beyond them and
 i must needs appear
second lord in like manner was i in debt to my importunate
 business but he would not hear my excuse i am
 sorry when he sent to borrow of me that my
 provision was out
first lord i am sick of that grief too as i understand how all
 things go
second lord every man here's so what would he have borrowed of
 you
first lord a thousand pieces
second lord a thousand pieces
first lord what of you
second lord he sent to me sirhere he comes
 enter timon and attendants
timon with all my heart gentlemen both and how fare you
first lord ever at the best hearing well of your lordship
second lord the swallow follows not summer more willing than we
 your lordship
timon aside nor more willingly leaves winter such
 summerbirds are men gentlemen our dinner will not
 recompense this long stay feast your ears with the
 music awhile if they will fare so harshly o the
 trumpet's sound we shall to t presently
first lord i hope it remains not unkindly with your lordship
 that i returned you an empty messenger
timon o sir let it not trouble you
second lord my noble lord
timon ah my good friend what cheer
second lord my most honourable lord i am e'en sick of shame
 that when your lordship this other day sent to me
 i was so unfortunate a beggar
timon think not on t sir
second lord if you had sent but two hours before
timon let it not cumber your better remembrance
 the banquet brought in
 come bring in all together
second lord all covered dishes
first lord royal cheer i warrant you
third lord doubt not that if money and the season can yield
 it
first lord how do you what's the news
third lord alcibiades is banished hear you of it
