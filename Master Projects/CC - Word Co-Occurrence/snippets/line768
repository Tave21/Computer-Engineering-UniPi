buckingham you cloudy princes and heartsorrowing peers
 that bear this mutual heavy load of moan
 now cheer each other in each other's love
 though we have spent our harvest of this king
 we are to reap the harvest of his son
 the broken rancour of your highswoln hearts
 but lately splinter'd knit and join'd together
 must gently be preserved cherish'd and kept
 me seemeth good that with some little train
 forthwith from ludlow the young prince be fetch'd
 hither to london to be crown'd our king
rivers why with some little train my lord of buckingham
buckingham marry my lord lest by a multitude
 the newheal'd wound of malice should break out
 which would be so much the more dangerous
 by how much the estate is green and yet ungovern'd
 where every horse bears his commanding rein
 and may direct his course as please himself
 as well the fear of harm as harm apparent
 in my opinion ought to be prevented
gloucester i hope the king made peace with all of us
 and the compact is firm and true in me
rivers and so in me and so i think in all
 yet since it is but green it should be put
 to no apparent likelihood of breach
 which haply by much company might be urged
 therefore i say with noble buckingham
 that it is meet so few should fetch the prince
hastings and so say i
gloucester then be it so and go we to determine
 who they shall be that straight shall post to ludlow
 madam and you my mother will you go
 to give your censures in this weighty business
queen elizabeth 
 with all our harts
duchess of york 
 exeunt all but buckingham and gloucester
buckingham my lord whoever journeys to the prince
 for god's sake let not us two be behind
 for by the way i'll sort occasion
 as index to the story we late talk'd of
 to part the queen's proud kindred from the king
gloucester my other self my counsel's consistory
 my oracle my prophet my dear cousin
 i like a child will go by thy direction
 towards ludlow then for we'll not stay behind
 exeunt

act ii
scene iii london a street
 enter two citizens meeting
first citizen neighbour well met whither away so fast
second citizen i promise you i scarcely know myself
 hear you the news abroad
first citizen ay that the king is dead
second citizen bad news by'r lady seldom comes the better
 i fear i fear twill prove a troublous world
 enter another citizen
third citizen neighbours god speed
first citizen give you good morrow sir
third citizen doth this news hold of good king edward's death
second citizen ay sir it is too true god help the while
third citizen then masters look to see a troublous world
first citizen no no by god's good grace his son shall reign
third citizen woe to the land that's govern'd by a child
second citizen in him there is a hope of government
 that in his nonage council under him
 and in his full and ripen'd years himself
 no doubt shall then and till then govern well
first citizen so stood the state when henry the sixth
 was crown'd in paris but at nine months old
third citizen stood the state so no no good friends god wot
 for then this land was famously enrich'd
 with politic grave counsel then the king
 had virtuous uncles to protect his grace
first citizen why so hath this both by the father and mother
third citizen better it were they all came by the father
 or by the father there were none at all
 for emulation now who shall be nearest
 will touch us all too near if god prevent not
 o full of danger is the duke of gloucester
 and the queen's sons and brothers haught and proud
 and were they to be ruled and not to rule
 this sickly land might solace as before
first citizen come come we fear the worst all shall be well
third citizen when clouds appear wise men put on their cloaks
 when great leaves fall the winter is at hand
 when the sun sets who doth not look for night
 untimely storms make men expect a dearth
 all may be well but if god sort it so
 tis more than we deserve or i expect
second citizen truly the souls of men are full of dread
 ye cannot reason almost with a man
 that looks not heavily and full of fear
third citizen before the times of change still is it so
 by a divine instinct men's minds mistrust
 ensuing dangers as by proof we see
 the waters swell before a boisterous storm
 but leave it all to god whither away
second citizen marry we were sent for to the justices
third citizen and so was i i'll bear you company
 exeunt

york ay mother but i would not have it so
duchess of york why my young cousin it is good to grow
york grandam one night as we did sit at supper
 my uncle rivers talk'd how i did grow
 more than my brother ay quoth my uncle
 gloucester
 small herbs have grace great weeds do grow apace'
 and since methinks i would not grow so fast
 because sweet flowers are slow and weeds make haste
duchess of york good faith good faith the saying did not hold
 in him that did object the same to thee
 he was the wretched'st thing when he was young
 so long agrowing and so leisurely
 that if this rule were true he should be gracious
archbishop of york why madam so no doubt he is
duchess of york i hope he is but yet let mothers doubt
york now by my troth if i had been remember'd
 i could have given my uncle's grace a flout
 to touch his growth nearer than he touch'd mine
duchess of york how my pretty york i pray thee let me hear it
york marry they say my uncle grew so fast
 that he could gnaw a crust at two hours old
 twas full two years ere i could get a tooth
 grandam this would have been a biting jest
duchess of york i pray thee pretty york who told thee this
york grandam his nurse
duchess of york his nurse why she was dead ere thou wert born
york if twere not she i cannot tell who told me
queen elizabeth a parlous boy go to you are too shrewd
archbishop of york good madam be not angry with the child

archbishop of york here comes a messenger what news
messenger such news my lord as grieves me to unfold
queen elizabeth how fares the prince
messenger well madam and in health

duchess of york who hath committed them
messenger the mighty dukes
 gloucester and buckingham
queen elizabeth for what offence
messenger the sum of all i can i have disclosed
 why or for what these nobles were committed
 is all unknown to me my gracious lady
queen elizabeth ay me i see the downfall of our house
 the tiger now hath seized the gentle hind
 insulting tyranny begins to jet
 upon the innocent and aweless throne
 welcome destruction death and massacre
 i see as in a map the end of all
duchess of york accursed and unquiet wrangling days
 how many of you have mine eyes beheld
 my husband lost his life to get the crown
 and often up and down my sons were toss'd
 for me to joy and weep their gain and loss
 and being seated and domestic broils
 clean overblown themselves the conquerors
 make war upon themselves blood against blood
 self against self o preposterous
 and frantic outrage end thy damned spleen
 or let me die to look on death no more
queen elizabeth come come my boy we will to sanctuary
 madam farewell
duchess of york i'll go along with you
queen elizabeth you have no cause
archbishop of york my gracious lady go
 and thither bear your treasure and your goods
 for my part i'll resign unto your grace
 the seal i keep and so betide to me
 as well i tender you and all of yours
 come i'll conduct you to the sanctuary
