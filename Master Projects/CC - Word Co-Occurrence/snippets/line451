 if he be less he's nothing but he's more
 had i more name for badness
duke vincentio by mine honesty
 if she be madas i believe no other
 her madness hath the oddest frame of sense
 such a dependency of thing on thing
 as e'er i heard in madness
isabella o gracious duke
 harp not on that nor do not banish reason
 for inequality but let your reason serve
 to make the truth appear where it seems hid
 and hide the false seems true
duke vincentio many that are not mad
 have sure more lack of reason what would you say
isabella i am the sister of one claudio
 condemn'd upon the act of fornication
 to lose his head condemn'd by angelo
 i in probation of a sisterhood
 was sent to by my brother one lucio
 as then the messenger
lucio that's i an't like your grace
 i came to her from claudio and desired her
 to try her gracious fortune with lord angelo
 for her poor brother's pardon
isabella that's he indeed
duke vincentio you were not bid to speak
lucio no my good lord
 nor wish'd to hold my peace
duke vincentio i wish you now then
 pray you take note of it and when you have
 a business for yourself pray heaven you then
 be perfect
lucio i warrant your honour
duke vincentio the warrants for yourself take heed to't
isabella this gentleman told somewhat of my tale
lucio right
duke vincentio it may be right but you are i the wrong
 to speak before your time proceed
isabella i went
 to this pernicious caitiff deputy
duke vincentio that's somewhat madly spoken
isabella pardon it
 the phrase is to the matter
duke vincentio mended again the matter proceed
isabella in brief to set the needless process by
 how i persuaded how i pray'd and kneel'd
 how he refell'd me and how i replied
 for this was of much lengththe vile conclusion
 i now begin with grief and shame to utter
 he would not but by gift of my chaste body
 to his concupiscible intemperate lust
 release my brother and after much debatement
 my sisterly remorse confutes mine honour
 and i did yield to him but the next morn betimes
 his purpose surfeiting he sends a warrant
 for my poor brother's head
duke vincentio this is most likely
isabella o that it were as like as it is true
duke vincentio by heaven fond wretch thou knowist not what thou speak'st
 or else thou art suborn'd against his honour
 in hateful practise first his integrity
 stands without blemish next it imports no reason
 that with such vehemency he should pursue
 faults proper to himself if he had so offended
 he would have weigh'd thy brother by himself
 and not have cut him off some one hath set you on
 confess the truth and say by whose advice
 thou camest here to complain
isabella and is this all
 then o you blessed ministers above
 keep me in patience and with ripen'd time
 unfold the evil which is here wrapt up
 in countenance heaven shield your grace from woe
 as i thus wrong'd hence unbelieved go
duke vincentio i know you'ld fain be gone an officer
 to prison with her shall we thus permit
 a blasting and a scandalous breath to fall
 on him so near us this needs must be a practise
 who knew of your intent and coming hither
isabella one that i would were here friar lodowick
duke vincentio a ghostly father belike who knows that lodowick
lucio my lord i know him tis a meddling friar
 i do not like the man had he been lay my lord
 for certain words he spake against your grace
 in your retirement i had swinged him soundly
duke vincentio words against me this is a good friar belike
 and to set on this wretched woman here
 against our substitute let this friar be found
lucio but yesternight my lord she and that friar
 i saw them at the prison a saucy friar
 a very scurvy fellow
friar peter blessed be your royal grace
 i have stood by my lord and i have heard
 your royal ear abused first hath this woman
 most wrongfully accused your substitute
 who is as free from touch or soil with her
 as she from one ungot
duke vincentio we did believe no less
 know you that friar lodowick that she speaks of
friar peter i know him for a man divine and holy
 not scurvy nor a temporary meddler
 as he's reported by this gentleman
 and on my trust a man that never yet
 did as he vouches misreport your grace
lucio my lord most villanously believe it
friar peter well he in time may come to clear himself
 but at this instant he is sick my lord
 of a strange fever upon his mere request
 being come to knowledge that there was complaint
 intended gainst lord angelo came i hither
 to speak as from his mouth what he doth know
 is true and false and what he with his oath
 and all probation will make up full clear
 whensoever he's convented first for this woman
 to justify this worthy nobleman
 so vulgarly and personally accused
 her shall you hear disproved to her eyes
 till she herself confess it
duke vincentio good friar let's hear it
 isabella is carried off guarded and mariana comes forward
 do you not smile at this lord angelo
 o heaven the vanity of wretched fools
 give us some seats come cousin angelo
 in this i'll be impartial be you judge
 of your own cause is this the witness friar
 first let her show her face and after speak
mariana pardon my lord i will not show my face
 until my husband bid me
duke vincentio what are you married
mariana no my lord
duke vincentio are you a maid
mariana no my lord
duke vincentio a widow then
mariana neither my lord
duke vincentio why you are nothing then neither maid widow nor wife
lucio my lord she may be a punk for many of them are
 neither maid widow nor wife
duke vincentio silence that fellow i would he had some cause
 to prattle for himself
lucio well my lord
mariana my lord i do confess i ne'er was married
 and i confess besides i am no maid
 i have known my husband yet my husband
 knows not that ever he knew me
lucio he was drunk then my lord it can be no better
duke vincentio for the benefit of silence would thou wert so too
lucio well my lord
duke vincentio this is no witness for lord angelo
mariana now i come to't my lord
 she that accuses him of fornication
 in selfsame manner doth accuse my husband
 and charges him my lord with such a time
 when i'll depose i had him in mine arms
 with all the effect of love
angelo charges she more than me
mariana not that i know
duke vincentio no you say your husband
mariana why just my lord and that is angelo
 who thinks he knows that he ne'er knew my body
 but knows he thinks that he knows isabel's
angelo this is a strange abuse let's see thy face
mariana my husband bids me now i will unmask
 unveiling
 this is that face thou cruel angelo
 which once thou sworest was worth the looking on
 this is the hand which with a vow'd contract
 was fast belock'd in thine this is the body
 that took away the match from isabel
 and did supply thee at thy gardenhouse
 in her imagined person
duke vincentio know you this woman
lucio carnally she says
duke vincentio sirrah no more
lucio enough my lord
angelo my lord i must confess i know this woman
 and five years since there was some speech of marriage
 betwixt myself and her which was broke off
 partly for that her promised proportions
 came short of composition but in chief
 for that her reputation was disvalued
 in levity since which time of five years
 i never spake with her saw her nor heard from her
 upon my faith and honour
mariana noble prince
 as there comes light from heaven and words from breath
 as there is sense in truth and truth in virtue
 i am affianced this man's wife as strongly
 as words could make up vows and my good lord
 but tuesday night last gone in's gardenhouse
 he knew me as a wife as this is true
 let me in safety raise me from my knees
 or else for ever be confixed here
 a marble monument
angelo i did but smile till now
 now good my lord give me the scope of justice
 my patience here is touch'd i do perceive
 these poor informal women are no more
 but instruments of some more mightier member
 that sets them on let me have way my lord
 to find this practise out
