 smiles at her news while warwick frowns at his
prince edward nay mark how lewis stamps as he were nettled
 i hope all's for the best
king lewis xi warwick what are thy news and yours fair queen
queen margaret mine such as fill my heart with unhoped joys
warwick mine full of sorrow and heart's discontent
king lewis xi what has your king married the lady grey
 and now to soothe your forgery and his
 sends me a paper to persuade me patience
 is this the alliance that he seeks with france
 dare he presume to scorn us in this manner
queen margaret i told your majesty as much before
 this proveth edward's love and warwick's honesty
warwick king lewis i here protest in sight of heaven
 and by the hope i have of heavenly bliss
 that i am clear from this misdeed of edward's
 no more my king for he dishonours me
 but most himself if he could see his shame
 did i forget that by the house of york
 my father came untimely to his death
 did i let pass the abuse done to my niece
 did i impale him with the regal crown
 did i put henry from his native right
 and am i guerdon'd at the last with shame
 shame on himself for my desert is honour
 and to repair my honour lost for him
 i here renounce him and return to henry
 my noble queen let former grudges pass
 and henceforth i am thy true servitor
 i will revenge his wrong to lady bona
 and replant henry in his former state
queen margaret warwick these words have turn'd my hate to love
 and i forgive and quite forget old faults
 and joy that thou becomest king henry's friend
warwick so much his friend ay his unfeigned friend
 that if king lewis vouchsafe to furnish us
 with some few bands of chosen soldiers
 i'll undertake to land them on our coast
 and force the tyrant from his seat by war
 tis not his newmade bride shall succor him
 and as for clarence as my letters tell me
 he's very likely now to fall from him
 for matching more for wanton lust than honour
 or than for strength and safety of our country
bona dear brother how shall bona be revenged
 but by thy help to this distressed queen
queen margaret renowned prince how shall poor henry live
 unless thou rescue him from foul despair
bona my quarrel and this english queen's are one
warwick and mine fair lady bona joins with yours
king lewis xi and mine with hers and thine and margaret's
 therefore at last i firmly am resolved
 you shall have aid
queen margaret let me give humble thanks for all at once
king lewis xi then england's messenger return in post
 and tell false edward thy supposed king
 that lewis of france is sending over masquers
 to revel it with him and his new bride
 thou seest what's past go fear thy king withal
bona tell him in hope he'll prove a widower shortly
 i'll wear the willow garland for his sake
queen margaret tell him my mourning weeds are laid aside
 and i am ready to put armour on
warwick tell him from me that he hath done me wrong
 and therefore i'll uncrown him ere't be long
 there's thy reward be gone
 exit post
king lewis xi but warwick
 thou and oxford with five thousand men
 shall cross the seas and bid false edward battle
 and as occasion serves this noble queen
 and prince shall follow with a fresh supply
 yet ere thou go but answer me one doubt
 what pledge have we of thy firm loyalty
warwick this shall assure my constant loyalty
 that if our queen and this young prince agree
 i'll join mine eldest daughter and my joy
 to him forthwith in holy wedlock bands
queen margaret yes i agree and thank you for your motion
 son edward she is fair and virtuous
 therefore delay not give thy hand to warwick
 and with thy hand thy faith irrevocable
 that only warwick's daughter shall be thine
prince edward yes i accept her for she well deserves it
 and here to pledge my vow i give my hand
 he gives his hand to warwick
king lewis xi why stay we now these soldiers shall be levied
 and thou lord bourbon our high admiral
 shalt waft them over with our royal fleet
 i long till edward fall by war's mischance
 for mocking marriage with a dame of france
 exeunt all but warwick
warwick i came from edward as ambassador
 but i return his sworn and mortal foe
 matter of marriage was the charge he gave me
 but dreadful war shall answer his demand
 had he none else to make a stale but me
 then none but i shall turn his jest to sorrow
 i was the chief that raised him to the crown
 and i'll be chief to bring him down again
 not that i pity henry's misery
 but seek revenge on edward's mockery
 exit
 3 king henry vi
act iv
scene i london the palace
 enter gloucester clarence somerset and montague
gloucester now tell me brother clarence what think you
 of this new marriage with the lady grey
 hath not our brother made a worthy choice
clarence alas you know tis far from hence to france
 how could he stay till warwick made return
somerset my lords forbear this talk here comes the king
gloucester and his wellchosen bride
clarence i mind to tell him plainly what i think
 flourish enter king edward iv attended queen
 elizabeth pembroke stafford hastings and others
king edward iv now brother of clarence how like you our choice
 that you stand pensive as half malcontent
clarence as well as lewis of france or the earl of warwick
 which are so weak of courage and in judgment
 that they'll take no offence at our abuse
king edward iv suppose they take offence without a cause
 they are but lewis and warwick i am edward
 your king and warwick's and must have my will
gloucester and shall have your will because our king
 yet hasty marriage seldom proveth well
king edward iv yea brother richard are you offended too
gloucester not i
 no god forbid that i should wish them sever'd
 whom god hath join'd together ay and twere pity
 to sunder them that yoke so well together
king edward iv setting your scorns and your mislike aside
 tell me some reason why the lady grey
 should not become my wife and england's queen
 and you too somerset and montague
 speak freely what you think
clarence then this is mine opinion that king lewis
 becomes your enemy for mocking him
 about the marriage of the lady bona
gloucester and warwick doing what you gave in charge
 is now dishonoured by this new marriage
king edward iv what if both lewis and warwick be appeased
 by such invention as i can devise
montague yet to have join'd with france in such alliance
 would more have strengthen'd this our commonwealth
 gainst foreign storms than any homebred marriage
hastings why knows not montague that of itself
 england is safe if true within itself
montague but the safer when tis back'd with france
hastings tis better using france than trusting france
 let us be back'd with god and with the seas
 which he hath given for fence impregnable
 and with their helps only defend ourselves
 in them and in ourselves our safety lies
clarence for this one speech lord hastings well deserves
 to have the heir of the lord hungerford
king edward iv ay what of that it was my will and grant
 and for this once my will shall stand for law
gloucester and yet methinks your grace hath not done well
 to give the heir and daughter of lord scales
 unto the brother of your loving bride
 she better would have fitted me or clarence
 but in your bride you bury brotherhood
clarence or else you would not have bestow'd the heir
 of the lord bonville on your new wife's son
 and leave your brothers to go speed elsewhere
king edward iv alas poor clarence is it for a wife
 that thou art malcontent i will provide thee
clarence in choosing for yourself you show'd your judgment
 which being shallow you give me leave
 to play the broker in mine own behalf
 and to that end i shortly mind to leave you
king edward iv leave me or tarry edward will be king
 and not be tied unto his brother's will
queen elizabeth my lords before it pleased his majesty
 to raise my state to title of a queen
 do me but right and you must all confess
 that i was not ignoble of descent
 and meaner than myself have had like fortune
 but as this title honours me and mine
 so your dislike to whom i would be pleasing
 doth cloud my joys with danger and with sorrow
king edward iv my love forbear to fawn upon their frowns
 what danger or what sorrow can befall thee
 so long as edward is thy constant friend
 and their true sovereign whom they must obey
 nay whom they shall obey and love thee too
 unless they seek for hatred at my hands
 which if they do yet will i keep thee safe
 and they shall feel the vengeance of my wrath
gloucester aside i hear yet say not much but think the more
 enter a post
king edward iv now messenger what letters or what news
 from france
post my sovereign liege no letters and few words
 but such as i without your special pardon
 dare not relate
king edward iv go to we pardon thee therefore in brief
 tell me their words as near as thou canst guess them
