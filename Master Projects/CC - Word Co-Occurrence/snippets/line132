it is also written in your law that the testimony of two men is true
i am one that bear witness of myself and the father that sent me beareth witness of me
then said they unto him where is thy father jesus answered ye neither know me nor my father if ye had known me ye should have known my father also
these words spake jesus in the treasury as he taught in the temple and no man laid hands on him for his hour was not yet come
then said jesus again unto them i go my way and ye shall seek me and shall die in your sins whither i go ye cannot come
then said the jews will he kill himself because he saith whither i go ye cannot come
and he said unto them ye are from beneath i am from above ye are of this world i am not of this world
i said therefore unto you that ye shall die in your sins for if ye believe not that i am he ye shall die in your sins
then said they unto him who art thou and jesus saith unto them even the same that i said unto you from the beginning
i have many things to say and to judge of you but he that sent me is true and i speak to the world those things which i have heard of him
they understood not that he spake to them of the father
then said jesus unto them when ye have lifted up the son of man then shall ye know that i am he and that i do nothing of myself but as my father hath taught me i speak these things
and he that sent me is with me the father hath not left me alone for i do always those things that please him
as he spake these words many believed on him
then said jesus to those jews which believed on him if ye continue in my word then are ye my disciples indeed
and ye shall know the truth and the truth shall make you free
they answered him we be abraham's seed and were never in bondage to any man how sayest thou ye shall be made free
jesus answered them verily verily i say unto you whosoever committeth sin is the servant of sin
and the servant abideth not in the house for ever but the son abideth ever
if the son therefore shall make you free ye shall be free indeed
i know that ye are abraham's seed but ye seek to kill me because my word hath no place in you
i speak that which i have seen with my father and ye do that which ye have seen with your father
they answered and said unto him abraham is our father jesus saith unto them if ye were abraham's children ye would do the works of abraham
but now ye seek to kill me a man that hath told you the truth which i have heard of god this did not abraham
ye do the deeds of your father then said they to him we be not born of fornication we have one father even god
jesus said unto them if god were your father ye would love me for i proceeded forth and came from god neither came i of myself but he sent me
why do ye not understand my speech even because ye cannot hear my word
ye are of your father the devil and the lusts of your father ye will do he was a murderer from the beginning and abode not in the truth because there is no truth in him when he speaketh a lie he speaketh of his own for he is a liar and the father of it
and because i tell you the truth ye believe me not
which of you convinceth me of sin and if i say the truth why do ye not believe me
he that is of god heareth god's words ye therefore hear them not because ye are not of god
then answered the jews and said unto him say we not well that thou art a samaritan and hast a devil
jesus answered i have not a devil but i honour my father and ye do dishonour me
and i seek not mine own glory there is one that seeketh and judgeth
verily verily i say unto you if a man keep my saying he shall never see death
then said the jews unto him now we know that thou hast a devil abraham is dead and the prophets and thou sayest if a man keep my saying he shall never taste of death
art thou greater than our father abraham which is dead and the prophets are dead whom makest thou thyself
jesus answered if i honour myself my honour is nothing it is my father that honoureth me of whom ye say that he is your god
yet ye have not known him but i know him and if i should say i know him not i shall be a liar like unto you but i know him and keep his saying
your father abraham rejoiced to see my day and he saw it and was glad
then said the jews unto him thou art not yet fifty years old and hast thou seen abraham
jesus said unto them verily verily i say unto you before abraham was i am
then took they up stones to cast at him but jesus hid himself and went out of the temple going through the midst of them and so passed by
and as jesus passed by he saw a man which was blind from his birth
and his disciples asked him saying master who did sin this man or his parents that he was born blind
jesus answered neither hath this man sinned nor his parents but that the works of god should be made manifest in him
i must work the works of him that sent me while it is day the night cometh when no man can work
as long as i am in the world i am the light of the world
when he had thus spoken he spat on the ground and made clay of the spittle and he anointed the eyes of the blind man with the clay
and said unto him go wash in the pool of siloam which is by interpretation sent he went his way therefore and washed and came seeing
the neighbours therefore and they which before had seen him that he was blind said is not this he that sat and begged
some said this is he others said he is like him but he said i am he
therefore said they unto him how were thine eyes opened
he answered and said a man that is called jesus made clay and anointed mine eyes and said unto me go to the pool of siloam and wash and i went and washed and i received sight
then said they unto him where is he he said i know not
they brought to the pharisees him that aforetime was blind
and it was the sabbath day when jesus made the clay and opened his eyes
then again the pharisees also asked him how he had received his sight he said unto them he put clay upon mine eyes and i washed and do see
therefore said some of the pharisees this man is not of god because he keepeth not the sabbath day others said how can a man that is a sinner do such miracles and there was a division among them
they say unto the blind man again what sayest thou of him that he hath opened thine eyes he said he is a prophet
but the jews did not believe concerning him that he had been blind and received his sight until they called the parents of him that had received his sight
and they asked them saying is this your son who ye say was born blind how then doth he now see
his parents answered them and said we know that this is our son and that he was born blind
but by what means he now seeth we know not or who hath opened his eyes we know not he is of age ask him he shall speak for himself
these words spake his parents because they feared the jews for the jews had agreed already that if any man did confess that he was christ he should be put out of the synagogue
therefore said his parents he is of age ask him
then again called they the man that was blind and said unto him give god the praise we know that this man is a sinner
he answered and said whether he be a sinner or no i know not one thing i know that whereas i was blind now i see
then said they to him again what did he to thee how opened he thine eyes
he answered them i have told you already and ye did not hear wherefore would ye hear it again will ye also be his disciples
then they reviled him and said thou art his disciple but we are moses disciples
we know that god spake unto moses as for this fellow we know not from whence he is
the man answered and said unto them why herein is a marvellous thing that ye know not from whence he is and yet he hath opened mine eyes
now we know that god heareth not sinners but if any man be a worshipper of god and doeth his will him he heareth
since the world began was it not heard that any man opened the eyes of one that was born blind
if this man were not of god he could do nothing
they answered and said unto him thou wast altogether born in sins and dost thou teach us and they cast him out
jesus heard that they had cast him out and when he had found him he said unto him dost thou believe on the son of god
he answered and said who is he lord that i might believe on him
and jesus said unto him thou hast both seen him and it is he that talketh with thee
and he said lord i believe and he worshipped him
and jesus said for judgment i am come into this world that they which see not might see and that they which see might be made blind
and some of the pharisees which were with him heard these words and said unto him are we blind also
jesus said unto them if ye were blind ye should have no sin but now ye say we see therefore your sin remaineth
verily verily i say unto you he that entereth not by the door into the sheepfold but climbeth up some other way the same is a thief and a robber
but he that entereth in by the door is the shepherd of the sheep
to him the porter openeth and the sheep hear his voice and he calleth his own sheep by name and leadeth them out
and when he putteth forth his own sheep he goeth before them and the sheep follow him for they know his voice
and a stranger will they not follow but will flee from him for they know not the voice of strangers
this parable spake jesus unto them but they understood not what things they were which he spake unto them
then said jesus unto them again verily verily i say unto you i am the door of the sheep
all that ever came before me are thieves and robbers but the sheep did not hear them
i am the door by me if any man enter in he shall be saved and shall go in and out and find pasture
the thief cometh not but for to steal and to kill and to destroy i am come that they might have life and that they might have it more abundantly
i am the good shepherd the good shepherd giveth his life for the sheep
but he that is an hireling and not the shepherd whose own the sheep are not seeth the wolf coming and leaveth the sheep and fleeth and the wolf catcheth them and scattereth the sheep
the hireling fleeth because he is an hireling and careth not for the sheep
i am the good shepherd and know my sheep and am known of mine
as the father knoweth me even so know i the father and i lay down my life for the sheep
and other sheep i have which are not of this fold them also i must bring and they shall hear my voice and there shall be one fold and one shepherd
therefore doth my father love me because i lay down my life that i might take it again
no man taketh it from me but i lay it down of myself i have power to lay it down and i have power to take it again this commandment have i received of my father
there was a division therefore again among the jews for these sayings
and many of them said he hath a devil and is mad why hear ye him
others said these are not the words of him that hath a devil can a devil open the eyes of the blind
and it was at jerusalem the feast of the dedication and it was winter
and jesus walked in the temple in solomon's porch
then came the jews round about him and said unto him how long dost thou make us to doubt if thou be the christ tell us plainly
jesus answered them i told you and ye believed not the works that i do in my father's name they bear witness of me
but ye believe not because ye are not of my sheep as i said unto you
my sheep hear my voice and i know them and they follow me
and i give unto them eternal life and they shall never perish neither shall any man pluck them out of my hand
my father which gave them me is greater than all and no man is able to pluck them out of my father's hand
i and my father are one
then the jews took up stones again to stone him
jesus answered them many good works have i shewed you from my father for which of those works do ye stone me
the jews answered him saying for a good work we stone thee not but for blasphemy and because that thou being a man makest thyself god
jesus answered them is it not written in your law i said ye are gods
if he called them gods unto whom the word of god came and the scripture cannot be broken
say ye of him whom the father hath sanctified and sent into the world thou blasphemest because i said i am the son of god
if i do not the works of my father believe me not
but if i do though ye believe not me believe the works that ye may know and believe that the father is in me and i in him
therefore they sought again to take him but he escaped out of their hand
and went away again beyond jordan into the place where john at first baptized and there he abode
and many resorted unto him and said john did no miracle but all things that john spake of this man were true
and many believed on him there
now a certain man was sick named lazarus of bethany the town of mary and her sister martha
it was that mary which anointed the lord with ointment and wiped his feet with her hair whose brother lazarus was sick
therefore his sisters sent unto him saying lord behold he whom thou lovest is sick
when jesus heard that he said this sickness is not unto death but for the glory of god that the son of god might be glorified thereby
now jesus loved martha and her sister and lazarus
when he had heard therefore that he was sick he abode two days still in the same place where he was
then after that saith he to his disciples let us go into judaea again
his disciples say unto him master the jews of late sought to stone thee and goest thou thither again
jesus answered are there not twelve hours in the day if any man walk in the day he stumbleth not because he seeth the light of this world
but if a man walk in the night he stumbleth because there is no light in him
these things said he and after that he saith unto them our friend lazarus sleepeth but i go that i may awake him out of sleep
then said his disciples lord if he sleep he shall do well
howbeit jesus spake of his death but they thought that he had spoken of taking of rest in sleep
then said jesus unto them plainly lazarus is dead
and i am glad for your sakes that i was not there to the intent ye may believe nevertheless let us go unto him
then said thomas which is called didymus unto his fellowdisciples let us also go that we may die with him
then when jesus came he found that he had lain in the grave four days already
now bethany was nigh unto jerusalem about fifteen furlongs off
and many of the jews came to martha and mary to comfort them concerning their brother
then martha as soon as she heard that jesus was coming went and met him but mary sat still in the house
then said martha unto jesus lord if thou hadst been here my brother had not died
but i know that even now whatsoever thou wilt ask of god god will give it thee
jesus saith unto her thy brother shall rise again
martha saith unto him i know that he shall rise again in the resurrection at the last day
jesus said unto her i am the resurrection and the life he that believeth in me though he were dead yet shall he live
and whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die believest thou this
she saith unto him yea lord i believe that thou art the christ the son of god which should come into the world
and when she had so said she went her way and called mary her sister secretly saying the master is come and calleth for thee
as soon as she heard that she arose quickly and came unto him
now jesus was not yet come into the town but was in that place where martha met him
the jews then which were with her in the house and comforted her when they saw mary that she rose up hastily and went out followed her saying she goeth unto the grave to weep there
then when mary was come where jesus was and saw him she fell down at his feet saying unto him lord if thou hadst been here my brother had not died
when jesus therefore saw her weeping and the jews also weeping which came with her he groaned in the spirit and was troubled
and said where have ye laid him they said unto him lord come and see
jesus wept
then said the jews behold how he loved him
and some of them said could not this man which opened the eyes of the blind have caused that even this man should not have died
jesus therefore again groaning in himself cometh to the grave it was a cave and a stone lay upon it
jesus said take ye away the stone martha the sister of him that was dead saith unto him lord by this time he stinketh for he hath been dead four days
jesus saith unto her said i not unto thee that if thou wouldest believe thou shouldest see the glory of god
then they took away the stone from the place where the dead was laid and jesus lifted up his eyes and said father i thank thee that thou hast heard me
and i knew that thou hearest me always but because of the people which stand by i said it that they may believe that thou hast sent me
and when he thus had spoken he cried with a loud voice lazarus come forth
and he that was dead came forth bound hand and foot with graveclothes and his face was bound about with a napkin jesus saith unto them loose him and let him go
then many of the jews which came to mary and had seen the things which jesus did believed on him
but some of them went their ways to the pharisees and told them what things jesus had done
then gathered the chief priests and the pharisees a council and said what do we for this man doeth many miracles
if we let him thus alone all men will believe on him and the romans shall come and take away both our place and nation
and one of them named caiaphas being the high priest that same year said unto them ye know nothing at all
nor consider that it is expedient for us that one man should die for the people and that the whole nation perish not
and this spake he not of himself but being high priest that year he prophesied that jesus should die for that nation
and not for that nation only but that also he should gather together in one the children of god that were scattered abroad
then from that day forth they took counsel together for to put him to death
jesus therefore walked no more openly among the jews but went thence unto a country near to the wilderness into a city called ephraim and there continued with his disciples
and the jews passover was nigh at hand and many went out of the country up to jerusalem before the passover to purify themselves
then sought they for jesus and spake among themselves as they stood in the temple what think ye that he will not come to the feast
now both the chief priests and the pharisees had given a commandment that if any man knew where he were he should shew it that they might take him
then jesus six days before the passover came to bethany where lazarus was which had been dead whom he raised from the dead
there they made him a supper and martha served but lazarus was one of them that sat at the table with him
then took mary a pound of ointment of spikenard very costly and anointed the feet of jesus and wiped his feet with her hair and the house was filled with the odour of the ointment
then saith one of his disciples judas iscariot simon's son which should betray him
why was not this ointment sold for three hundred pence and given to the poor
this he said not that he cared for the poor but because he was a thief and had the bag and bare what was put therein
then said jesus let her alone against the day of my burying hath she kept this
for the poor always ye have with you but me ye have not always
much people of the jews therefore knew that he was there and they came not for jesus sake only but that they might see lazarus also whom he had raised from the dead
but the chief priests consulted that they might put lazarus also to death
because that by reason of him many of the jews went away and believed on jesus
on the next day much people that were come to the feast when they heard that jesus was coming to jerusalem
took branches of palm trees and went forth to meet him and cried hosanna blessed is the king of israel that cometh in the name of the lord
and jesus when he had found a young ass sat thereon as it is written
fear not daughter of sion behold thy king cometh sitting on an ass's colt
these things understood not his disciples at the first but when jesus was glorified then remembered they that these things were written of him and that they had done these things unto him
the people therefore that was with him when he called lazarus out of his grave and raised him from the dead bare record
