 are all call'd neatstill virginalling
 upon his palmhow now you wanton calf
 art thou my calf
mamillius yes if you will my lord
leontes thou want'st a rough pash and the shoots that i have
 to be full like me yet they say we are
 almost as like as eggs women say so
 that will say anything but were they false
 as o'erdyed blacks as wind as waters false
 as dice are to be wish'd by one that fixes
 no bourn twixt his and mine yet were it true
 to say this boy were like me come sir page
 look on me with your welkin eye sweet villain
 most dear'st my collop can thy dammay't be
 affection thy intention stabs the centre
 thou dost make possible things not so held
 communicatest with dreamshow can this be
 with what's unreal thou coactive art
 and fellow'st nothing then tis very credent
 thou mayst cojoin with something and thou dost
 and that beyond commission and i find it
 and that to the infection of my brains
 and hardening of my brows
polixenes what means sicilia
hermione he something seems unsettled
polixenes how my lord
 what cheer how is't with you best brother
hermione you look as if you held a brow of much distraction
 are you moved my lord
leontes no in good earnest
 how sometimes nature will betray its folly
 its tenderness and make itself a pastime
 to harder bosoms looking on the lines
 of my boy's face methoughts i did recoil
 twentythree years and saw myself unbreech'd
 in my green velvet coat my dagger muzzled
 lest it should bite its master and so prove
 as ornaments oft do too dangerous
 how like methought i then was to this kernel
 this squash this gentleman mine honest friend
 will you take eggs for money
mamillius no my lord i'll fight
leontes you will why happy man be's dole my brother
 are you so fond of your young prince as we
 do seem to be of ours
polixenes if at home sir
 he's all my exercise my mirth my matter
 now my sworn friend and then mine enemy
 my parasite my soldier statesman all
 he makes a july's day short as december
 and with his varying childness cures in me
 thoughts that would thick my blood
leontes so stands this squire
 officed with me we two will walk my lord
 and leave you to your graver steps hermione
 how thou lovest us show in our brother's welcome
 let what is dear in sicily be cheap
 next to thyself and my young rover he's
 apparent to my heart
hermione if you would seek us
 we are yours i the garden shall's attend you there
leontes to your own bents dispose you you'll be found
 be you beneath the sky
 aside
 i am angling now
 though you perceive me not how i give line
 go to go to
 how she holds up the neb the bill to him
 and arms her with the boldness of a wife
 to her allowing husband
 exeunt polixenes hermione and attendants
 gone already
 inchthick kneedeep o'er head and
 ears a fork'd one
 go play boy play thy mother plays and i
 play too but so disgraced a part whose issue
 will hiss me to my grave contempt and clamour
 will be my knell go play boy play
 there have been
 or i am much deceived cuckolds ere now
 and many a man there is even at this present
 now while i speak this holds his wife by the arm
 that little thinks she has been sluiced in's absence
 and his pond fish'd by his next neighbour by
 sir smile his neighbour nay there's comfort in't
 whiles other men have gates and those gates open'd
 as mine against their will should all despair
 that have revolted wives the tenth of mankind
 would hang themselves physic for't there is none
 it is a bawdy planet that will strike
 where tis predominant and tis powerful think it
 from east west north and south be it concluded
 no barricado for a belly know't
 it will let in and out the enemy
 with bag and baggage many thousand on's
 have the disease and feel't not how now boy
mamillius i am like you they say
leontes why that's some comfort what camillo there
camillo ay my good lord
leontes go play mamillius thou'rt an honest man
 exit mamillius
 camillo this great sir will yet stay longer
camillo you had much ado to make his anchor hold
 when you cast out it still came home
leontes didst note it
camillo he would not stay at your petitions made
 his business more material
leontes didst perceive it
 aside
 they're here with me already whispering rounding
 sicilia is a soforth tis far gone
 when i shall gust it last how came't camillo
 that he did stay
camillo at the good queen's entreaty
leontes at the queen's be't good should be pertinent
 but so it is it is not was this taken
 by any understanding pate but thine
 for thy conceit is soaking will draw in
 more than the common blocks not noted is't
 but of the finer natures by some severals
 of headpiece extraordinary lower messes
 perchance are to this business purblind say
camillo business my lord i think most understand
 bohemia stays here longer
leontes ha
camillo stays here longer
leontes ay but why
camillo to satisfy your highness and the entreaties
 of our most gracious mistress
leontes satisfy
 the entreaties of your mistress satisfy
 let that suffice i have trusted thee camillo
 with all the nearest things to my heart as well
 my chambercouncils wherein priestlike thou
 hast cleansed my bosom i from thee departed
 thy penitent reform'd but we have been
 deceived in thy integrity deceived
 in that which seems so
camillo be it forbid my lord
leontes to bide upon't thou art not honest or
 if thou inclinest that way thou art a coward
 which hoxes honesty behind restraining
 from course required or else thou must be counted
 a servant grafted in my serious trust
 and therein negligent or else a fool
 that seest a game play'd home the rich stake drawn
 and takest it all for jest
camillo my gracious lord
 i may be negligent foolish and fearful
 in every one of these no man is free
 but that his negligence his folly fear
 among the infinite doings of the world
 sometime puts forth in your affairs my lord
 if ever i were wilfulnegligent
 it was my folly if industriously
 i play'd the fool it was my negligence
 not weighing well the end if ever fearful
 to do a thing where i the issue doubted
 where of the execution did cry out
 against the nonperformance twas a fear
 which oft infects the wisest these my lord
 are such allow'd infirmities that honesty
 is never free of but beseech your grace
 be plainer with me let me know my trespass
 by its own visage if i then deny it
 tis none of mine
leontes ha not you seen camillo
 but that's past doubt you have or your eyeglass
 is thicker than a cuckold's hornor heard
 for to a vision so apparent rumour
 cannot be muteor thoughtfor cogitation
 resides not in that man that does not think
 my wife is slippery if thou wilt confess
 or else be impudently negative
 to have nor eyes nor ears nor thought then say
 my wife's a hobbyhorse deserves a name
 as rank as any flaxwench that puts to
 before her trothplight say't and justify't
camillo i would not be a standerby to hear
 my sovereign mistress clouded so without
 my present vengeance taken shrew my heart
 you never spoke what did become you less
 than this which to reiterate were sin
 as deep as that though true
leontes is whispering nothing
 is leaning cheek to cheek is meeting noses
 kissing with inside lip stopping the career
 of laughing with a sigha note infallible
 of breaking honestyhorsing foot on foot
 skulking in corners wishing clocks more swift
 hours minutes noon midnight and all eyes
 blind with the pin and web but theirs theirs only
 that would unseen be wicked is this nothing
 why then the world and all that's in't is nothing
 the covering sky is nothing bohemia nothing
 my wife is nothing nor nothing have these nothings
 if this be nothing
camillo good my lord be cured
 of this diseased opinion and betimes
 for tis most dangerous
