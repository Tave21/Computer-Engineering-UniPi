thus saith the lord let not the wise man glory in his wisdom neither let the mighty man glory in his might let not the rich man glory in his riches
but let him that glorieth glory in this that he understandeth and knoweth me that i am the lord which exercise lovingkindness judgment and righteousness in the earth for in these things i delight saith the lord
behold the days come saith the lord that i will punish all them which are circumcised with the uncircumcised
egypt and judah and edom and the children of ammon and moab and all that are in the utmost corners that dwell in the wilderness for all these nations are uncircumcised and all the house of israel are uncircumcised in the heart
hear ye the word which the lord speaketh unto you o house of israel
thus saith the lord learn not the way of the heathen and be not dismayed at the signs of heaven for the heathen are dismayed at them
for the customs of the people are vain for one cutteth a tree out of the forest the work of the hands of the workman with the axe
they deck it with silver and with gold they fasten it with nails and with hammers that it move not
they are upright as the palm tree but speak not they must needs be borne because they cannot go be not afraid of them for they cannot do evil neither also is it in them to do good
forasmuch as there is none like unto thee o lord thou art great and thy name is great in might
who would not fear thee o king of nations for to thee doth it appertain forasmuch as among all the wise men of the nations and in all their kingdoms there is none like unto thee
but they are altogether brutish and foolish the stock is a doctrine of vanities
silver spread into plates is brought from tarshish and gold from uphaz the work of the workman and of the hands of the founder blue and purple is their clothing they are all the work of cunning men
but the lord is the true god he is the living god and an everlasting king at his wrath the earth shall tremble and the nations shall not be able to abide his indignation
thus shall ye say unto them the gods that have not made the heavens and the earth even they shall perish from the earth and from under these heavens
he hath made the earth by his power he hath established the world by his wisdom and hath stretched out the heavens by his discretion
when he uttereth his voice there is a multitude of waters in the heavens and he causeth the vapours to ascend from the ends of the earth he maketh lightnings with rain and bringeth forth the wind out of his treasures
every man is brutish in his knowledge every founder is confounded by the graven image for his molten image is falsehood and there is no breath in them
they are vanity and the work of errors in the time of their visitation they shall perish
the portion of jacob is not like them for he is the former of all things and israel is the rod of his inheritance the lord of hosts is his name
gather up thy wares out of the land o inhabitant of the fortress
for thus saith the lord behold i will sling out the inhabitants of the land at this once and will distress them that they may find it so
woe is me for my hurt my wound is grievous but i said truly this is a grief and i must bear it
my tabernacle is spoiled and all my cords are broken my children are gone forth of me and they are not there is none to stretch forth my tent any more and to set up my curtains
for the pastors are become brutish and have not sought the lord therefore they shall not prosper and all their flocks shall be scattered
behold the noise of the bruit is come and a great commotion out of the north country to make the cities of judah desolate and a den of dragons
o lord i know that the way of man is not in himself it is not in man that walketh to direct his steps
o lord correct me but with judgment not in thine anger lest thou bring me to nothing
pour out thy fury upon the heathen that know thee not and upon the families that call not on thy name for they have eaten up jacob and devoured him and consumed him and have made his habitation desolate
the word that came to jeremiah from the lord saying
hear ye the words of this covenant and speak unto the men of judah and to the inhabitants of jerusalem
and say thou unto them thus saith the lord god of israel cursed be the man that obeyeth not the words of this covenant
which i commanded your fathers in the day that i brought them forth out of the land of egypt from the iron furnace saying obey my voice and do them according to all which i command you so shall ye be my people and i will be your god
that i may perform the oath which i have sworn unto your fathers to give them a land flowing with milk and honey as it is this day then answered i and said so be it o lord
then the lord said unto me proclaim all these words in the cities of judah and in the streets of jerusalem saying hear ye the words of this covenant and do them
for i earnestly protested unto your fathers in the day that i brought them up out of the land of egypt even unto this day rising early and protesting saying obey my voice
yet they obeyed not nor inclined their ear but walked every one in the imagination of their evil heart therefore i will bring upon them all the words of this covenant which i commanded them to do but they did them not
and the lord said unto me a conspiracy is found among the men of judah and among the inhabitants of jerusalem
they are turned back to the iniquities of their forefathers which refused to hear my words and they went after other gods to serve them the house of israel and the house of judah have broken my covenant which i made with their fathers
therefore thus saith the lord behold i will bring evil upon them which they shall not be able to escape and though they shall cry unto me i will not hearken unto them
then shall the cities of judah and inhabitants of jerusalem go and cry unto the gods unto whom they offer incense but they shall not save them at all in the time of their trouble
for according to the number of thy cities were thy gods o judah and according to the number of the streets of jerusalem have ye set up altars to that shameful thing even altars to burn incense unto baal
therefore pray not thou for this people neither lift up a cry or prayer for them for i will not hear them in the time that they cry unto me for their trouble
what hath my beloved to do in mine house seeing she hath wrought lewdness with many and the holy flesh is passed from thee when thou doest evil then thou rejoicest
the lord called thy name a green olive tree fair and of goodly fruit with the noise of a great tumult he hath kindled fire upon it and the branches of it are broken
for the lord of hosts that planted thee hath pronounced evil against thee for the evil of the house of israel and of the house of judah which they have done against themselves to provoke me to anger in offering incense unto baal
and the lord hath given me knowledge of it and i know it then thou shewedst me their doings
but i was like a lamb or an ox that is brought to the slaughter and i knew not that they had devised devices against me saying let us destroy the tree with the fruit thereof and let us cut him off from the land of the living that his name may be no more remembered
but o lord of hosts that judgest righteously that triest the reins and the heart let me see thy vengeance on them for unto thee have i revealed my cause
therefore thus saith the lord of the men of anathoth that seek thy life saying prophesy not in the name of the lord that thou die not by our hand
therefore thus saith the lord of hosts behold i will punish them the young men shall die by the sword their sons and their daughters shall die by famine
and there shall be no remnant of them for i will bring evil upon the men of anathoth even the year of their visitation
righteous art thou o lord when i plead with thee yet let me talk with thee of thy judgments wherefore doth the way of the wicked prosper wherefore are all they happy that deal very treacherously
thou hast planted them yea they have taken root they grow yea they bring forth fruit thou art near in their mouth and far from their reins
but thou o lord knowest me thou hast seen me and tried mine heart toward thee pull them out like sheep for the slaughter and prepare them for the day of slaughter
how long shall the land mourn and the herbs of every field wither for the wickedness of them that dwell therein the beasts are consumed and the birds because they said he shall not see our last end
if thou hast run with the footmen and they have wearied thee then how canst thou contend with horses and if in the land of peace wherein thou trustedst they wearied thee then how wilt thou do in the swelling of jordan
for even thy brethren and the house of thy father even they have dealt treacherously with thee yea they have called a multitude after thee believe them not though they speak fair words unto thee
i have forsaken mine house i have left mine heritage i have given the dearly beloved of my soul into the hand of her enemies
mine heritage is unto me as a lion in the forest it crieth out against me therefore have i hated it
mine heritage is unto me as a speckled bird the birds round about are against her come ye assemble all the beasts of the field come to devour
many pastors have destroyed my vineyard they have trodden my portion under foot they have made my pleasant portion a desolate wilderness
they have made it desolate and being desolate it mourneth unto me the whole land is made desolate because no man layeth it to heart
the spoilers are come upon all high places through the wilderness for the sword of the lord shall devour from the one end of the land even to the other end of the land no flesh shall have peace
they have sown wheat but shall reap thorns they have put themselves to pain but shall not profit and they shall be ashamed of your revenues because of the fierce anger of the lord
thus saith the lord against all mine evil neighbours that touch the inheritance which i have caused my people israel to inherit behold i will pluck them out of their land and pluck out the house of judah from among them
and it shall come to pass after that i have plucked them out i will return and have compassion on them and will bring them again every man to his heritage and every man to his land
and it shall come to pass if they will diligently learn the ways of my people to swear by my name the lord liveth as they taught my people to swear by baal then shall they be built in the midst of my people
but if they will not obey i will utterly pluck up and destroy that nation saith the lord
thus saith the lord unto me go and get thee a linen girdle and put it upon thy loins and put it not in water
so i got a girdle according to the word of the lord and put it on my loins
and the word of the lord came unto me the second time saying
take the girdle that thou hast got which is upon thy loins and arise go to euphrates and hide it there in a hole of the rock
so i went and hid it by euphrates as the lord commanded me
and it came to pass after many days that the lord said unto me arise go to euphrates and take the girdle from thence which i commanded thee to hide there
then i went to euphrates and digged and took the girdle from the place where i had hid it and behold the girdle was marred it was profitable for nothing
then the word of the lord came unto me saying
thus saith the lord after this manner will i mar the pride of judah and the great pride of jerusalem
this evil people which refuse to hear my words which walk in the imagination of their heart and walk after other gods to serve them and to worship them shall even be as this girdle which is good for nothing
for as the girdle cleaveth to the loins of a man so have i caused to cleave unto me the whole house of israel and the whole house of judah saith the lord that they might be unto me for a people and for a name and for a praise and for a glory but they would not hear
therefore thou shalt speak unto them this word thus saith the lord god of israel every bottle shall be filled with wine and they shall say unto thee do we not certainly know that every bottle shall be filled with wine
then shalt thou say unto them thus saith the lord behold i will fill all the inhabitants of this land even the kings that sit upon david's throne and the priests and the prophets and all the inhabitants of jerusalem with drunkenness
and i will dash them one against another even the fathers and the sons together saith the lord i will not pity nor spare nor have mercy but destroy them
hear ye and give ear be not proud for the lord hath spoken
give glory to the lord your god before he cause darkness and before your feet stumble upon the dark mountains and while ye look for light he turn it into the shadow of death and make it gross darkness
but if ye will not hear it my soul shall weep in secret places for your pride and mine eye shall weep sore and run down with tears because the lord's flock is carried away captive
say unto the king and to the queen humble yourselves sit down for your principalities shall come down even the crown of your glory
the cities of the south shall be shut up and none shall open them judah shall be carried away captive all of it it shall be wholly carried away captive
lift up your eyes and behold them that come from the north where is the flock that was given thee thy beautiful flock
what wilt thou say when he shall punish thee for thou hast taught them to be captains and as chief over thee shall not sorrows take thee as a woman in travail
and if thou say in thine heart wherefore come these things upon me for the greatness of thine iniquity are thy skirts discovered and thy heels made bare
can the ethiopian change his skin or the leopard his spots then may ye also do good that are accustomed to do evil
therefore will i scatter them as the stubble that passeth away by the wind of the wilderness
this is thy lot the portion of thy measures from me saith the lord because thou hast forgotten me and trusted in falsehood
therefore will i discover thy skirts upon thy face that thy shame may appear
i have seen thine adulteries and thy neighings the lewdness of thy whoredom and thine abominations on the hills in the fields woe unto thee o jerusalem wilt thou not be made clean when shall it once be
the word of the lord that came to jeremiah concerning the dearth
judah mourneth and the gates thereof languish they are black unto the ground and the cry of jerusalem is gone up
and their nobles have sent their little ones to the waters they came to the pits and found no water they returned with their vessels empty they were ashamed and confounded and covered their heads
because the ground is chapt for there was no rain in the earth the plowmen were ashamed they covered their heads
yea the hind also calved in the field and forsook it because there was no grass
and the wild asses did stand in the high places they snuffed up the wind like dragons their eyes did fail because there was no grass
o lord though our iniquities testify against us do thou it for thy name's sake for our backslidings are many we have sinned against thee
o the hope of israel the saviour thereof in time of trouble why shouldest thou be as a stranger in the land and as a wayfaring man that turneth aside to tarry for a night
why shouldest thou be as a man astonied as a mighty man that cannot save yet thou o lord art in the midst of us and we are called by thy name leave us not
thus saith the lord unto this people thus have they loved to wander they have not refrained their feet therefore the lord doth not accept them he will now remember their iniquity and visit their sins
then said the lord unto me pray not for this people for their good
when they fast i will not hear their cry and when they offer burnt offering and an oblation i will not accept them but i will consume them by the sword and by the famine and by the pestilence
then said i ah lord god behold the prophets say unto them ye shall not see the sword neither shall ye have famine but i will give you assured peace in this place
then the lord said unto me the prophets prophesy lies in my name i sent them not neither have i commanded them neither spake unto them they prophesy unto you a false vision and divination and a thing of nought and the deceit of their heart
therefore thus saith the lord concerning the prophets that prophesy in my name and i sent them not yet they say sword and famine shall not be in this land by sword and famine shall those prophets be consumed
and the people to whom they prophesy shall be cast out in the streets of jerusalem because of the famine and the sword and they shall have none to bury them them their wives nor their sons nor their daughters for i will pour their wickedness upon them
therefore thou shalt say this word unto them let mine eyes run down with tears night and day and let them not cease for the virgin daughter of my people is broken with a great breach with a very grievous blow
if i go forth into the field then behold the slain with the sword and if i enter into the city then behold them that are sick with famine yea both the prophet and the priest go about into a land that they know not
hast thou utterly rejected judah hath thy soul lothed zion why hast thou smitten us and there is no healing for us we looked for peace and there is no good and for the time of healing and behold trouble
we acknowledge o lord our wickedness and the iniquity of our fathers for we have sinned against thee
do not abhor us for thy name's sake do not disgrace the throne of thy glory remember break not thy covenant with us
are there any among the vanities of the gentiles that can cause rain or can the heavens give showers art not thou he o lord our god therefore we will wait upon thee for thou hast made all these things
then said the lord unto me though moses and samuel stood before me yet my mind could not be toward this people cast them out of my sight and let them go forth
and it shall come to pass if they say unto thee whither shall we go forth then thou shalt tell them thus saith the lord such as are for death to death and such as are for the sword to the sword and such as are for the famine to the famine and such as are for the captivity to the captivity
and i will appoint over them four kinds saith the lord the sword to slay and the dogs to tear and the fowls of the heaven and the beasts of the earth to devour and destroy
and i will cause them to be removed into all kingdoms of the earth because of manasseh the son of hezekiah king of judah for that which he did in jerusalem
for who shall have pity upon thee o jerusalem or who shall bemoan thee or who shall go aside to ask how thou doest
thou hast forsaken me saith the lord thou art gone backward therefore will i stretch out my hand against thee and destroy thee i am weary with repenting
and i will fan them with a fan in the gates of the land i will bereave them of children i will destroy my people since they return not from their ways
their widows are increased to me above the sand of the seas i have brought upon them against the mother of the young men a spoiler at noonday i have caused him to fall upon it suddenly and terrors upon the city
she that hath borne seven languisheth she hath given up the ghost her sun is gone down while it was yet day she hath been ashamed and confounded and the residue of them will i deliver to the sword before their enemies saith the lord
woe is me my mother that thou hast borne me a man of strife and a man of contention to the whole earth i have neither lent on usury nor men have lent to me on usury yet every one of them doth curse me
the lord said verily it shall be well with thy remnant verily i will cause the enemy to entreat thee well in the time of evil and in the time of affliction
shall iron break the northern iron and the steel
thy substance and thy treasures will i give to the spoil without price and that for all thy sins even in all thy borders
and i will make thee to pass with thine enemies into a land which thou knowest not for a fire is kindled in mine anger which shall burn upon you
o lord thou knowest remember me and visit me and revenge me of my persecutors take me not away in thy longsuffering know that for thy sake i have suffered rebuke
thy words were found and i did eat them and thy word was unto me the joy and rejoicing of mine heart for i am called by thy name o lord god of hosts
i sat not in the assembly of the mockers nor rejoiced i sat alone because of thy hand for thou hast filled me with indignation
why is my pain perpetual and my wound incurable which refuseth to be healed wilt thou be altogether unto me as a liar and as waters that fail
therefore thus saith the lord if thou return then will i bring thee again and thou shalt stand before me and if thou take forth the precious from the vile thou shalt be as my mouth let them return unto thee but return not thou unto them
and i will make thee unto this people a fenced brasen wall and they shall fight against thee but they shall not prevail against thee for i am with thee to save thee and to deliver thee saith the lord
and i will deliver thee out of the hand of the wicked and i will redeem thee out of the hand of the terrible
the word of the lord came also unto me saying
thou shalt not take thee a wife neither shalt thou have sons or daughters in this place
for thus saith the lord concerning the sons and concerning the daughters that are born in this place and concerning their mothers that bare them and concerning their fathers that begat them in this land
they shall die of grievous deaths they shall not be lamented neither shall they be buried but they shall be as dung upon the face of the earth and they shall be consumed by the sword and by famine and their carcases shall be meat for the fowls of heaven and for the beasts of the earth
for thus saith the lord enter not into the house of mourning neither go to lament nor bemoan them for i have taken away my peace from this people saith the lord even lovingkindness and mercies
both the great and the small shall die in this land they shall not be buried neither shall men lament for them nor cut themselves nor make themselves bald for them
neither shall men tear themselves for them in mourning to comfort them for the dead neither shall men give them the cup of consolation to drink for their father or for their mother
thou shalt not also go into the house of feasting to sit with them to eat and to drink
for thus saith the lord of hosts the god of israel behold i will cause to cease out of this place in your eyes and in your days the voice of mirth and the voice of gladness the voice of the bridegroom and the voice of the bride
and it shall come to pass when thou shalt shew this people all these words and they shall say unto thee wherefore hath the lord pronounced all this great evil against us or what is our iniquity or what is our sin that we have committed against the lord our god
then shalt thou say unto them because your fathers have forsaken me saith the lord and have walked after other gods and have served them and have worshipped them and have forsaken me and have not kept my law
and ye have done worse than your fathers for behold ye walk every one after the imagination of his evil heart that they may not hearken unto me
therefore will i cast you out of this land into a land that ye know not neither ye nor your fathers and there shall ye serve other gods day and night where i will not shew you favour
therefore behold the days come saith the lord that it shall no more be said the lord liveth that brought up the children of israel out of the land of egypt
but the lord liveth that brought up the children of israel from the land of the north and from all the lands whither he had driven them and i will bring them again into their land that i gave unto their fathers
behold i will send for many fishers saith the lord and they shall fish them and after will i send for many hunters and they shall hunt them from every mountain and from every hill and out of the holes of the rocks
for mine eyes are upon all their ways they are not hid from my face neither is their iniquity hid from mine eyes
and first i will recompense their iniquity and their sin double because they have defiled my land they have filled mine inheritance with the carcases of their detestable and abominable things
o lord my strength and my fortress and my refuge in the day of affliction the gentiles shall come unto thee from the ends of the earth and shall say surely our fathers have inherited lies vanity and things wherein there is no profit
shall a man make gods unto himself and they are no gods
therefore behold i will this once cause them to know i will cause them to know mine hand and my might and they shall know that my name is the lord
the sin of judah is written with a pen of iron and with the point of a diamond it is graven upon the table of their heart and upon the horns of your altars
whilst their children remember their altars and their groves by the green trees upon the high hills
o my mountain in the field i will give thy substance and all thy treasures to the spoil and thy high places for sin throughout all thy borders
and thou even thyself shalt discontinue from thine heritage that i gave thee and i will cause thee to serve thine enemies in the land which thou knowest not for ye have kindled a fire in mine anger which shall burn for ever
thus saith the lord cursed be the man that trusteth in man and maketh flesh his arm and whose heart departeth from the lord
for he shall be like the heath in the desert and shall not see when good cometh but shall inhabit the parched places in the wilderness in a salt land and not inhabited
blessed is the man that trusteth in the lord and whose hope the lord is
for he shall be as a tree planted by the waters and that spreadeth out her roots by the river and shall not see when heat cometh but her leaf shall be green and shall not be careful in the year of drought neither shall cease from yielding fruit
the heart is deceitful above all things and desperately wicked who can know it
i the lord search the heart i try the reins even to give every man according to his ways and according to the fruit of his doings
as the partridge sitteth on eggs and hatcheth them not so he that getteth riches and not by right shall leave them in the midst of his days and at his end shall be a fool
a glorious high throne from the beginning is the place of our sanctuary
o lord the hope of israel all that forsake thee shall be ashamed and they that depart from me shall be written in the earth because they have forsaken the lord the fountain of living waters
heal me o lord and i shall be healed save me and i shall be saved for thou art my praise
behold they say unto me where is the word of the lord let it come now
as for me i have not hastened from being a pastor to follow thee neither have i desired the woeful day thou knowest that which came out of my lips was right before thee
be not a terror unto me thou art my hope in the day of evil
let them be confounded that persecute me but let not me be confounded let them be dismayed but let not me be dismayed bring upon them the day of evil and destroy them with double destruction
thus said the lord unto me go and stand in the gate of the children of the people whereby the kings of judah come in and by the which they go out and in all the gates of jerusalem
and say unto them hear ye the word of the lord ye kings of judah and all judah and all the inhabitants of jerusalem that enter in by these gates
thus saith the lord take heed to yourselves and bear no burden on the sabbath day nor bring it in by the gates of jerusalem
neither carry forth a burden out of your houses on the sabbath day neither do ye any work but hallow ye the sabbath day as i commanded your fathers
but they obeyed not neither inclined their ear but made their neck stiff that they might not hear nor receive instruction
and it shall come to pass if ye diligently hearken unto me saith the lord to bring in no burden through the gates of this city on the sabbath day but hallow the sabbath day to do no work therein
then shall there enter into the gates of this city kings and princes sitting upon the throne of david riding in chariots and on horses they and their princes the men of judah and the inhabitants of jerusalem and this city shall remain for ever
and they shall come from the cities of judah and from the places about jerusalem and from the land of benjamin and from the plain and from the mountains and from the south bringing burnt offerings and sacrifices and meat offerings and incense and bringing sacrifices of praise unto the house of the lord
but if ye will not hearken unto me to hallow the sabbath day and not to bear a burden even entering in at the gates of jerusalem on the sabbath day then will i kindle a fire in the gates thereof and it shall devour the palaces of jerusalem and it shall not be quenched
the word which came to jeremiah from the lord saying
arise and go down to the potter's house and there i will cause thee to hear my words
then i went down to the potter's house and behold he wrought a work on the wheels
and the vessel that he made of clay was marred in the hand of the potter so he made it again another vessel as seemed good to the potter to make it
then the word of the lord came to me saying
o house of israel cannot i do with you as this potter saith the lord behold as the clay is in the potter's hand so are ye in mine hand o house of israel
at what instant i shall speak concerning a nation and concerning a kingdom to pluck up and to pull down and to destroy it
if that nation against whom i have pronounced turn from their evil i will repent of the evil that i thought to do unto them
and at what instant i shall speak concerning a nation and concerning a kingdom to build and to plant it
if it do evil in my sight that it obey not my voice then i will repent of the good wherewith i said i would benefit them
now therefore go to speak to the men of judah and to the inhabitants of jerusalem saying thus saith the lord behold i frame evil against you and devise a device against you return ye now every one from his evil way and make your ways and your doings good
and they said there is no hope but we will walk after our own devices and we will every one do the imagination of his evil heart
therefore thus saith the lord ask ye now among the heathen who hath heard such things the virgin of israel hath done a very horrible thing
