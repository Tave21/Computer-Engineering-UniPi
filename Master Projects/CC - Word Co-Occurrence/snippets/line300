 and fear'st to die famine is in thy cheeks
 need and oppression starveth in thine eyes
 contempt and beggary hangs upon thy back
 the world is not thy friend nor the world's law
 the world affords no law to make thee rich
 then be not poor but break it and take this
apothecary my poverty but not my will consents
romeo i pay thy poverty and not thy will
apothecary put this in any liquid thing you will
 and drink it off and if you had the strength
 of twenty men it would dispatch you straight
romeo there is thy gold worse poison to men's souls
 doing more murders in this loathsome world
 than these poor compounds that thou mayst not sell
 i sell thee poison thou hast sold me none
 farewell buy food and get thyself in flesh
 come cordial and not poison go with me
 to juliet's grave for there must i use thee

act v
scene ii friar laurence's cell
 enter friar john
friar john holy franciscan friar brother ho
 enter friar laurence
friar laurence this same should be the voice of friar john
 welcome from mantua what says romeo
 or if his mind be writ give me his letter
friar john going to find a barefoot brother out
 one of our order to associate me
 here in this city visiting the sick
 and finding him the searchers of the town
 suspecting that we both were in a house
 where the infectious pestilence did reign
 seal'd up the doors and would not let us forth
 so that my speed to mantua there was stay'd
friar laurence who bare my letter then to romeo
friar john i could not send ithere it is again
 nor get a messenger to bring it thee
 so fearful were they of infection
friar laurence unhappy fortune by my brotherhood
 the letter was not nice but full of charge
 of dear import and the neglecting it
 may do much danger friar john go hence
 get me an iron crow and bring it straight
 unto my cell
friar john brother i'll go and bring it thee
 exit
friar laurence now must i to the monument alone
 within three hours will fair juliet wake
 she will beshrew me much that romeo
 hath had no notice of these accidents
 but i will write again to mantua
 and keep her at my cell till romeo come
 poor living corse closed in a dead man's tomb
 exit
 romeo and juliet
act v
scene iii a churchyard in it a tomb belonging to the capulets
 enter paris and his page bearing flowers and a torch
paris give me thy torch boy hence and stand aloof
 yet put it out for i would not be seen
 under yond yewtrees lay thee all along
 holding thine ear close to the hollow ground
 so shall no foot upon the churchyard tread
 being loose unfirm with digging up of graves
 but thou shalt hear it whistle then to me
 as signal that thou hear'st something approach
 give me those flowers do as i bid thee go
page aside i am almost afraid to stand alone
 here in the churchyard yet i will adventure
 retires
paris sweet flower with flowers thy bridal bed i strew
 o woe thy canopy is dust and stones
 which with sweet water nightly i will dew
 or wanting that with tears distill'd by moans
 the obsequies that i for thee will keep
 nightly shall be to strew thy grave and weep
 the page whistles
 the boy gives warning something doth approach
 what cursed foot wanders this way tonight
 to cross my obsequies and true love's rite
 what with a torch muffle me night awhile
 retires
 enter romeo and balthasar with a torch
 mattock &c
romeo give me that mattock and the wrenching iron
 hold take this letter early in the morning
 see thou deliver it to my lord and father
 give me the light upon thy life i charge thee
 whate'er thou hear'st or seest stand all aloof
 and do not interrupt me in my course
 why i descend into this bed of death
 is partly to behold my lady's face
 but chiefly to take thence from her dead finger
 a precious ring a ring that i must use
 in dear employment therefore hence be gone
 but if thou jealous dost return to pry
 in what i further shall intend to do
 by heaven i will tear thee joint by joint
 and strew this hungry churchyard with thy limbs
 the time and my intents are savagewild
 more fierce and more inexorable far
 than empty tigers or the roaring sea
balthasar i will be gone sir and not trouble you
romeo so shalt thou show me friendship take thou that
 live and be prosperous and farewell good fellow
balthasar aside for all this same i'll hide me hereabout
 his looks i fear and his intents i doubt
 retires
romeo thou detestable maw thou womb of death
 gorged with the dearest morsel of the earth
 thus i enforce thy rotten jaws to open
 and in despite i'll cram thee with more food
 opens the tomb
paris this is that banish'd haughty montague
 that murder'd my love's cousin with which grief
 it is supposed the fair creature died
 and here is come to do some villanous shame
 to the dead bodies i will apprehend him
 comes forward
 stop thy unhallow'd toil vile montague
 can vengeance be pursued further than death
 condemned villain i do apprehend thee
 obey and go with me for thou must die
romeo i must indeed and therefore came i hither
 good gentle youth tempt not a desperate man
 fly hence and leave me think upon these gone
 let them affright thee i beseech thee youth
 put not another sin upon my head
 by urging me to fury o be gone
 by heaven i love thee better than myself
 for i come hither arm'd against myself
 stay not be gone live and hereafter say
 a madman's mercy bade thee run away
paris i do defy thy conjurations
 and apprehend thee for a felon here
romeo wilt thou provoke me then have at thee boy
 they fight
page o lord they fight i will go call the watch
 exit
paris o i am slain
 falls
 if thou be merciful
 open the tomb lay me with juliet
 dies
romeo in faith i will let me peruse this face
 mercutio's kinsman noble county paris
 what said my man when my betossed soul
 did not attend him as we rode i think
 he told me paris should have married juliet
 said he not so or did i dream it so
 or am i mad hearing him talk of juliet
 to think it was so o give me thy hand
 one writ with me in sour misfortune's book
 i'll bury thee in a triumphant grave
 a grave o no a lantern slaughter'd youth
 for here lies juliet and her beauty makes
 this vault a feasting presence full of light
 death lie thou there by a dead man interr'd
 laying paris in the tomb
 how oft when men are at the point of death
 have they been merry which their keepers call
 a lightning before death o how may i
 call this a lightning o my love my wife
 death that hath suck'd the honey of thy breath
 hath had no power yet upon thy beauty
 thou art not conquer'd beauty's ensign yet
 is crimson in thy lips and in thy cheeks
 and death's pale flag is not advanced there
 tybalt liest thou there in thy bloody sheet
 o what more favour can i do to thee
 than with that hand that cut thy youth in twain
 to sunder his that was thine enemy
 forgive me cousin ah dear juliet
 why art thou yet so fair shall i believe
 that unsubstantial death is amorous
 and that the lean abhorred monster keeps
 thee here in dark to be his paramour
 for fear of that i still will stay with thee
 and never from this palace of dim night
 depart again here here will i remain
 with worms that are thy chambermaids o here
 will i set up my everlasting rest
 and shake the yoke of inauspicious stars
 from this worldwearied flesh eyes look your last
 arms take your last embrace and lips o you
 the doors of breath seal with a righteous kiss
 a dateless bargain to engrossing death
 come bitter conduct come unsavoury guide
 thou desperate pilot now at once run on
 the dashing rocks thy seasick weary bark
 here's to my love
 drinks
 o true apothecary
 thy drugs are quick thus with a kiss i die
 dies
 enter at the other end of the churchyard friar
 laurence with a lantern crow and spade
friar laurence saint francis be my speed how oft tonight
