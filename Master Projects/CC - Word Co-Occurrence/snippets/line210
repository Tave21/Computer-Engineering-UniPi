 thou turn'st mine eyes into my very soul
 and there i see such black and grained spots
 as will not leave their tinct
hamlet nay but to live
 in the rank sweat of an enseamed bed
 stew'd in corruption honeying and making love
 over the nasty sty
queen gertrude o speak to me no more
 these words like daggers enter in mine ears
 no more sweet hamlet
hamlet a murderer and a villain
 a slave that is not twentieth part the tithe
 of your precedent lord a vice of kings
 a cutpurse of the empire and the rule
 that from a shelf the precious diadem stole
 and put it in his pocket
queen gertrude no more
hamlet a king of shreds and patches
 enter ghost
 save me and hover o'er me with your wings
 you heavenly guards what would your gracious figure
queen gertrude alas he's mad
hamlet do you not come your tardy son to chide
 that lapsed in time and passion lets go by
 the important acting of your dread command o say
ghost do not forget this visitation
 is but to whet thy almost blunted purpose
 but look amazement on thy mother sits
 o step between her and her fighting soul
 conceit in weakest bodies strongest works
 speak to her hamlet
hamlet how is it with you lady
queen gertrude alas how is't with you
 that you do bend your eye on vacancy
 and with the incorporal air do hold discourse
 forth at your eyes your spirits wildly peep
 and as the sleeping soldiers in the alarm
 your bedded hair like life in excrements
 starts up and stands on end o gentle son
 upon the heat and flame of thy distemper
 sprinkle cool patience whereon do you look
hamlet on him on him look you how pale he glares
 his form and cause conjoin'd preaching to stones
 would make them capable do not look upon me
 lest with this piteous action you convert
 my stern effects then what i have to do
 will want true colour tears perchance for blood
queen gertrude to whom do you speak this
hamlet do you see nothing there
queen gertrude nothing at all yet all that is i see
hamlet nor did you nothing hear
queen gertrude no nothing but ourselves
hamlet why look you there look how it steals away
 my father in his habit as he lived
 look where he goes even now out at the portal
 exit ghost
queen gertrude this the very coinage of your brain
 this bodiless creation ecstasy
 is very cunning in
hamlet ecstasy
 my pulse as yours doth temperately keep time
 and makes as healthful music it is not madness
 that i have utter'd bring me to the test
 and i the matter will reword which madness
 would gambol from mother for love of grace
 lay not that mattering unction to your soul
 that not your trespass but my madness speaks
 it will but skin and film the ulcerous place
 whilst rank corruption mining all within
 infects unseen confess yourself to heaven
 repent what's past avoid what is to come
 and do not spread the compost on the weeds
 to make them ranker forgive me this my virtue
 for in the fatness of these pursy times
 virtue itself of vice must pardon beg
 yea curb and woo for leave to do him good
queen gertrude o hamlet thou hast cleft my heart in twain
hamlet o throw away the worser part of it
 and live the purer with the other half
 good night but go not to mine uncle's bed
 assume a virtue if you have it not
 that monster custom who all sense doth eat
 of habits devil is angel yet in this
 that to the use of actions fair and good
 he likewise gives a frock or livery
 that aptly is put on refrain tonight
 and that shall lend a kind of easiness
 to the next abstinence the next more easy
 for use almost can change the stamp of nature
 and either the devil or throw him out
 with wondrous potency once more good night
 and when you are desirous to be bless'd
 i'll blessing beg of you for this same lord
 pointing to polonius
 i do repent but heaven hath pleased it so
 to punish me with this and this with me
 that i must be their scourge and minister
 i will bestow him and will answer well
 the death i gave him so again good night
 i must be cruel only to be kind
 thus bad begins and worse remains behind
 one word more good lady
queen gertrude what shall i do
hamlet not this by no means that i bid you do
 let the bloat king tempt you again to bed
 pinch wanton on your cheek call you his mouse
 and let him for a pair of reechy kisses
 or paddling in your neck with his damn'd fingers
 make you to ravel all this matter out
 that i essentially am not in madness
 but mad in craft twere good you let him know
 for who that's but a queen fair sober wise
 would from a paddock from a bat a gib
 such dear concernings hide who would do so
 no in despite of sense and secrecy
 unpeg the basket on the house's top
 let the birds fly and like the famous ape
 to try conclusions in the basket creep
 and break your own neck down
queen gertrude be thou assured if words be made of breath
 and breath of life i have no life to breathe
 what thou hast said to me
hamlet i must to england you know that
queen gertrude alack
 i had forgot tis so concluded on
hamlet there's letters seal'd and my two schoolfellows
 whom i will trust as i will adders fang'd
 they bear the mandate they must sweep my way
 and marshal me to knavery let it work
 for tis the sport to have the engineer
 hoist with his own petard and t shall go hard
 but i will delve one yard below their mines
 and blow them at the moon o tis most sweet
 when in one line two crafts directly meet
 this man shall set me packing
 i'll lug the guts into the neighbour room
 mother good night indeed this counsellor
 is now most still most secret and most grave
 who was in life a foolish prating knave
 come sir to draw toward an end with you
 good night mother

 enter king claudius queen gertrude rosencrantz
 and guildenstern
king claudius there's matter in these sighs these profound heaves
 you must translate tis fit we understand them
 where is your son
queen gertrude bestow this place on us a little while
 exeunt rosencrantz and guildenstern
 ah my good lord what have i seen tonight
king claudius what gertrude how does hamlet
queen gertrude mad as the sea and wind when both contend
 which is the mightier in his lawless fit
 behind the arras hearing something stir
 whips out his rapier cries a rat a rat'
 and in this brainish apprehension kills
 the unseen good old man
king claudius o heavy deed
 it had been so with us had we been there
 his liberty is full of threats to all
 to you yourself to us to every one
 alas how shall this bloody deed be answer'd
 it will be laid to us whose providence
 should have kept short restrain'd and out of haunt
 this mad young man but so much was our love
 we would not understand what was most fit
 but like the owner of a foul disease
 to keep it from divulging let it feed
 even on the pith of life where is he gone
queen gertrude to draw apart the body he hath kill'd
 o'er whom his very madness like some ore
 among a mineral of metals base
 shows itself pure he weeps for what is done
king claudius o gertrude come away
 the sun no sooner shall the mountains touch
 but we will ship him hence and this vile deed
 we must with all our majesty and skill
 both countenance and excuse ho guildenstern
 reenter rosencrantz and guildenstern
 friends both go join you with some further aid
 hamlet in madness hath polonius slain
 and from his mother's closet hath he dragg'd him
 go seek him out speak fair and bring the body
 into the chapel i pray you haste in this
 exeunt rosencrantz and guildenstern
 come gertrude we'll call up our wisest friends
 and let them know both what we mean to do
 and what's untimely done 
 whose whisper o'er the world's diameter
 as level as the cannon to his blank
 transports his poison'd shot may miss our name
 and hit the woundless air o come away
 my soul is full of discord and dismay
