 o'erbear the shores of my mortality
 and drown me with their sweetness o come hither
 thou that beget'st him that did thee beget
 thou that wast born at sea buried at tarsus
 and found at sea again o helicanus
 down on thy knees thank the holy gods as loud
 as thunder threatens us this is marina
 what was thy mother's name tell me but that
 for truth can never be confirm'd enough
 though doubts did ever sleep
marina first sir i pray
 what is your title
pericles i am pericles of tyre but tell me now
 my drown'd queen's name as in the rest you said
 thou hast been godlike perfect
 the heir of kingdoms and another like
 to pericles thy father
marina is it no more to be your daughter than
 to say my mother's name was thaisa
 thaisa was my mother who did end
 the minute i began
pericles now blessing on thee rise thou art my child
 give me fresh garments mine own helicanus
 she is not dead at tarsus as she should have been
 by savage cleon she shall tell thee all
 when thou shalt kneel and justify in knowledge
 she is thy very princess who is this
helicanus sir tis the governor of mytilene
 who hearing of your melancholy state
 did come to see you
pericles i embrace you
 give me my robes i am wild in my beholding
 o heavens bless my girl but hark what music
 tell helicanus my marina tell him
 o'er point by point for yet he seems to doubt
 how sure you are my daughter but what music
helicanus my lord i hear none
pericles none
 the music of the spheres list my marina
lysimachus it is not good to cross him give him way
pericles rarest sounds do ye not hear
lysimachus my lord i hear
 music
pericles most heavenly music
 it nips me unto listening and thick slumber
 hangs upon mine eyes let me rest
 sleeps
lysimachus a pillow for his head
 so leave him all well my companion friends
 if this but answer to my just belief
 i'll well remember you
 exeunt all but pericles
 diana appears to pericles as in a vision
diana my temple stands in ephesus hie thee thither
 and do upon mine altar sacrifice
 there when my maiden priests are met together
 before the people all
 reveal how thou at sea didst lose thy wife
 to mourn thy crosses with thy daughter's call
 and give them repetition to the life
 or perform my bidding or thou livest in woe
 do it and happy by my silver bow
 awake and tell thy dream
 disappears
pericles celestial dian goddess argentine
 i will obey thee helicanus
 reenter helicanus lysimachus and marina
helicanus sir
pericles my purpose was for tarsus there to strike
 the inhospitable cleon but i am
 for other service first toward ephesus
 turn our blown sails eftsoons i'll tell thee why
 to lysimachus
 shall we refresh us sir upon your shore
 and give you gold for such provision
 as our intents will need
lysimachus sir
 with all my heart and when you come ashore
 i have another suit
pericles you shall prevail
 were it to woo my daughter for it seems
 you have been noble towards her
lysimachus sir lend me your arm
pericles come my marina
 exeunt

act v
scene ii
 enter gower before the temple of diana at ephesus
gower now our sands are almost run
 more a little and then dumb
 this my last boon give me
 for such kindness must relieve me
 that you aptly will suppose
 what pageantry what feats what shows
 what minstrelsy and pretty din
 the regent made in mytilene
 to greet the king so he thrived
 that he is promised to be wived
 to fair marina but in no wise
 till he had done his sacrifice
 as dian bade whereto being bound
 the interim pray you all confound
 in feather'd briefness sails are fill'd
 and wishes fall out as they're will'd
 at ephesus the temple see
 our king and all his company
 that he can hither come so soon
 is by your fancy's thankful doom
 exit

act v
scene iii the temple of diana at ephesus thaisa standing
 near the altar as high priestess a number of
 virgins on each side cerimon and other inhabitants
 of ephesus attending
 enter pericles with his train lysimachus
 helicanus marina and a lady
pericles hail dian to perform thy just command
 i here confess myself the king of tyre
 who frighted from my country did wed
 at pentapolis the fair thaisa
 at sea in childbed died she but brought forth
 a maidchild call'd marina who o goddess
 wears yet thy silver livery she at tarsus
 was nursed with cleon who at fourteen years
 he sought to murder but her better stars
 brought her to mytilene gainst whose shore
 riding her fortunes brought the maid aboard us
 where by her own most clear remembrance she
 made known herself my daughter
thaisa voice and favour
 you are you areo royal pericles
 faints
pericles what means the nun she dies help gentlemen
cerimon noble sir
 if you have told diana's altar true
 this is your wife
pericles reverend appearer no
 i threw her overboard with these very arms
cerimon upon this coast i warrant you
pericles tis most certain
cerimon look to the lady o she's but o'erjoy'd
 early in blustering morn this lady was
 thrown upon this shore i oped the coffin
 found there rich jewels recover'd her and placed her
 here in diana's temple
pericles may we see them
cerimon great sir they shall be brought you to my house
 whither i invite you look thaisa is recovered
thaisa o let me look
 if he be none of mine my sanctity
 will to my sense bend no licentious ear
 but curb it spite of seeing o my lord
 are you not pericles like him you spake
 like him you are did you not name a tempest
 a birth and death
pericles the voice of dead thaisa
thaisa that thaisa am i supposed dead
 and drown'd
pericles immortal dian
thaisa now i know you better
 when we with tears parted pentapolis
 the king my father gave you such a ring
 shows a ring
pericles this this no more you gods your present kindness
 makes my past miseries sports you shall do well
 that on the touching of her lips i may
 melt and no more be seen o come be buried
 a second time within these arms
marina my heart
 leaps to be gone into my mother's bosom
 kneels to thaisa
pericles look who kneels here flesh of thy flesh thaisa
 thy burden at the sea and call'd marina
 for she was yielded there
thaisa blest and mine own
helicanus hail madam and my queen
thaisa i know you not
pericles you have heard me say when i did fly from tyre
 i left behind an ancient substitute
 can you remember what i call'd the man
 i have named him oft
thaisa twas helicanus then
pericles still confirmation
 embrace him dear thaisa this is he
 now do i long to hear how you were found
 how possibly preserved and who to thank
 besides the gods for this great miracle
thaisa lord cerimon my lord this man
 through whom the gods have shown their power that can
 from first to last resolve you
pericles reverend sir
 the gods can have no mortal officer
 more like a god than you will you deliver
 how this dead queen relives
cerimon i will my lord
 beseech you first go with me to my house
 where shall be shown you all was found with her
 how she came placed here in the temple
