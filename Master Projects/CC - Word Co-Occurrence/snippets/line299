 her blood is settled and her joints are stiff
 life and these lips have long been separated
 death lies on her like an untimely frost
 upon the sweetest flower of all the field
nurse o lamentable day
lady capulet o woful time
capulet death that hath ta'en her hence to make me wail
 ties up my tongue and will not let me speak
 enter friar laurence and paris with musicians
friar laurence come is the bride ready to go to church
capulet ready to go but never to return
 o son the night before thy weddingday
 hath death lain with thy wife there she lies
 flower as she was deflowered by him
 death is my soninlaw death is my heir
 my daughter he hath wedded i will die
 and leave him all life living all is death's
paris have i thought long to see this morning's face
 and doth it give me such a sight as this
lady capulet accursed unhappy wretched hateful day
 most miserable hour that e'er time saw
 in lasting labour of his pilgrimage
 but one poor one one poor and loving child
 but one thing to rejoice and solace in
 and cruel death hath catch'd it from my sight
nurse o woe o woful woful woful day
 most lamentable day most woful day
 that ever ever i did yet behold
 o day o day o day o hateful day
 never was seen so black a day as this
 o woful day o woful day
paris beguiled divorced wronged spited slain
 most detestable death by thee beguil'd
 by cruel cruel thee quite overthrown
 o love o life not life but love in death
capulet despised distressed hated martyr'd kill'd
 uncomfortable time why camest thou now
 to murder murder our solemnity
 o child o child my soul and not my child
 dead art thou alack my child is dead
 and with my child my joys are buried
friar laurence peace ho for shame confusion's cure lives not
 in these confusions heaven and yourself
 had part in this fair maid now heaven hath all
 and all the better is it for the maid
 your part in her you could not keep from death
 but heaven keeps his part in eternal life
 the most you sought was her promotion
 for twas your heaven she should be advanced
 and weep ye now seeing she is advanced
 above the clouds as high as heaven itself
 o in this love you love your child so ill
 that you run mad seeing that she is well
 she's not well married that lives married long
 but she's best married that dies married young
 dry up your tears and stick your rosemary
 on this fair corse and as the custom is
 in all her best array bear her to church
 for though fond nature bids us an lament
 yet nature's tears are reason's merriment
capulet all things that we ordained festival
 turn from their office to black funeral
 our instruments to melancholy bells
 our wedding cheer to a sad burial feast
 our solemn hymns to sullen dirges change
 our bridal flowers serve for a buried corse
 and all things change them to the contrary
friar laurence sir go you in and madam go with him
 and go sir paris every one prepare
 to follow this fair corse unto her grave
 the heavens do lour upon you for some ill
 move them no more by crossing their high will

 romeo and juliet
act v
scene i mantua a street
 enter romeo
romeo if i may trust the flattering truth of sleep
 my dreams presage some joyful news at hand
 my bosom's lord sits lightly in his throne
 and all this day an unaccustom'd spirit
 lifts me above the ground with cheerful thoughts
 i dreamt my lady came and found me dead
 strange dream that gives a dead man leave
 to think
 and breathed such life with kisses in my lips
 that i revived and was an emperor
 ah me how sweet is love itself possess'd
 when but love's shadows are so rich in joy
 enter balthasar booted
 news from veronahow now balthasar
 dost thou not bring me letters from the friar
 how doth my lady is my father well
 how fares my juliet that i ask again
 for nothing can be ill if she be well
balthasar then she is well and nothing can be ill
 her body sleeps in capel's monument
 and her immortal part with angels lives
 i saw her laid low in her kindred's vault
 and presently took post to tell it you
 o pardon me for bringing these ill news
 since you did leave it for my office sir
romeo is it even so then i defy you stars
 thou know'st my lodging get me ink and paper
 and hire posthorses i will hence tonight
balthasar i do beseech you sir have patience
 your looks are pale and wild and do import
 some misadventure
romeo tush thou art deceived
 leave me and do the thing i bid thee do
 hast thou no letters to me from the friar
balthasar no my good lord
romeo no matter get thee gone
 and hire those horses i'll be with thee straight
 exit balthasar
 well juliet i will lie with thee tonight
 let's see for means o mischief thou art swift
 to enter in the thoughts of desperate men
 i do remember an apothecary
 and hereabouts he dwellswhich late i noted
 in tatter'd weeds with overwhelming brows
 culling of simples meagre were his looks
 sharp misery had worn him to the bones
 and in his needy shop a tortoise hung
 an alligator stuff'd and other skins
 of illshaped fishes and about his shelves
 a beggarly account of empty boxes
 green earthen pots bladders and musty seeds
 remnants of packthread and old cakes of roses
 were thinly scatter'd to make up a show
 noting this penury to myself i said
 an if a man did need a poison now
 whose sale is present death in mantua
 here lives a caitiff wretch would sell it him'
 o this same thought did but forerun my need
 and this same needy man must sell it me
 as i remember this should be the house
 being holiday the beggar's shop is shut
 what ho apothecary
 enter apothecary
apothecary who calls so loud
romeo come hither man i see that thou art poor
 hold there is forty ducats let me have
 a dram of poison such soonspeeding gear
 as will disperse itself through all the veins
 that the lifeweary taker may fall dead
 and that the trunk may be discharged of breath
 as violently as hasty powder fired
 doth hurry from the fatal cannon's womb
apothecary such mortal drugs i have but mantua's law
 is death to any he that utters them
romeo art thou so bare and full of wretchedness
