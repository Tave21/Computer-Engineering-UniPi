keep thy foot when thou goest to the house of god and be more ready to hear than to give the sacrifice of fools for they consider not that they do evil
be not rash with thy mouth and let not thine heart be hasty to utter any thing before god for god is in heaven and thou upon earth therefore let thy words be few
for a dream cometh through the multitude of business and a fool's voice is known by multitude of words
when thou vowest a vow unto god defer not to pay it for he hath no pleasure in fools pay that which thou hast vowed
better is it that thou shouldest not vow than that thou shouldest vow and not pay
suffer not thy mouth to cause thy flesh to sin neither say thou before the angel that it was an error wherefore should god be angry at thy voice and destroy the work of thine hands
for in the multitude of dreams and many words there are also divers vanities but fear thou god
if thou seest the oppression of the poor and violent perverting of judgment and justice in a province marvel not at the matter for he that is higher than the highest regardeth and there be higher than they
moreover the profit of the earth is for all the king himself is served by the field
he that loveth silver shall not be satisfied with silver nor he that loveth abundance with increase this is also vanity
when goods increase they are increased that eat them and what good is there to the owners thereof saving the beholding of them with their eyes
the sleep of a labouring man is sweet whether he eat little or much but the abundance of the rich will not suffer him to sleep
there is a sore evil which i have seen under the sun namely riches kept for the owners thereof to their hurt
but those riches perish by evil travail and he begetteth a son and there is nothing in his hand
as he came forth of his mother's womb naked shall he return to go as he came and shall take nothing of his labour which he may carry away in his hand
and this also is a sore evil that in all points as he came so shall he go and what profit hath he that hath laboured for the wind
all his days also he eateth in darkness and he hath much sorrow and wrath with his sickness
behold that which i have seen it is good and comely for one to eat and to drink and to enjoy the good of all his labour that he taketh under the sun all the days of his life which god giveth him for it is his portion
every man also to whom god hath given riches and wealth and hath given him power to eat thereof and to take his portion and to rejoice in his labour this is the gift of god
for he shall not much remember the days of his life because god answereth him in the joy of his heart
there is an evil which i have seen under the sun and it is common among men
a man to whom god hath given riches wealth and honour so that he wanteth nothing for his soul of all that he desireth yet god giveth him not power to eat thereof but a stranger eateth it this is vanity and it is an evil disease
if a man beget an hundred children and live many years so that the days of his years be many and his soul be not filled with good and also that he have no burial i say that an untimely birth is better than he
for he cometh in with vanity and departeth in darkness and his name shall be covered with darkness
moreover he hath not seen the sun nor known any thing this hath more rest than the other
yea though he live a thousand years twice told yet hath he seen no good do not all go to one place
all the labour of man is for his mouth and yet the appetite is not filled
for what hath the wise more than the fool what hath the poor that knoweth to walk before the living
better is the sight of the eyes than the wandering of the desire this is also vanity and vexation of spirit
that which hath been is named already and it is known that it is man neither may he contend with him that is mightier than he
seeing there be many things that increase vanity what is man the better
for who knoweth what is good for man in this life all the days of his vain life which he spendeth as a shadow for who can tell a man what shall be after him under the sun
a good name is better than precious ointment and the day of death than the day of one's birth
it is better to go to the house of mourning than to go to the house of feasting for that is the end of all men and the living will lay it to his heart
sorrow is better than laughter for by the sadness of the countenance the heart is made better
the heart of the wise is in the house of mourning but the heart of fools is in the house of mirth
it is better to hear the rebuke of the wise than for a man to hear the song of fools
for as the crackling of thorns under a pot so is the laughter of the fool this also is vanity
surely oppression maketh a wise man mad and a gift destroyeth the heart
better is the end of a thing than the beginning thereof and the patient in spirit is better than the proud in spirit
be not hasty in thy spirit to be angry for anger resteth in the bosom of fools
say not thou what is the cause that the former days were better than these for thou dost not enquire wisely concerning this
wisdom is good with an inheritance and by it there is profit to them that see the sun
for wisdom is a defence and money is a defence but the excellency of knowledge is that wisdom giveth life to them that have it
consider the work of god for who can make that straight which he hath made crooked
in the day of prosperity be joyful but in the day of adversity consider god also hath set the one over against the other to the end that man should find nothing after him
all things have i seen in the days of my vanity there is a just man that perisheth in his righteousness and there is a wicked man that prolongeth his life in his wickedness
be not righteous over much neither make thyself over wise why shouldest thou destroy thyself 
be not over much wicked neither be thou foolish why shouldest thou die before thy time
it is good that thou shouldest take hold of this yea also from this withdraw not thine hand for he that feareth god shall come forth of them all
wisdom strengtheneth the wise more than ten mighty men which are in the city
for there is not a just man upon earth that doeth good and sinneth not
also take no heed unto all words that are spoken lest thou hear thy servant curse thee
for oftentimes also thine own heart knoweth that thou thyself likewise hast cursed others
all this have i proved by wisdom i said i will be wise but it was far from me
that which is far off and exceeding deep who can find it out
i applied mine heart to know and to search and to seek out wisdom and the reason of things and to know the wickedness of folly even of foolishness and madness
and i find more bitter than death the woman whose heart is snares and nets and her hands as bands whoso pleaseth god shall escape from her but the sinner shall be taken by her
behold this have i found saith the preacher counting one by one to find out the account
which yet my soul seeketh but i find not one man among a thousand have i found but a woman among all those have i not found
lo this only have i found that god hath made man upright but they have sought out many inventions
who is as the wise man and who knoweth the interpretation of a thing a man's wisdom maketh his face to shine and the boldness of his face shall be changed
i counsel thee to keep the king's commandment and that in regard of the oath of god
be not hasty to go out of his sight stand not in an evil thing for he doeth whatsoever pleaseth him
where the word of a king is there is power and who may say unto him what doest thou
whoso keepeth the commandment shall feel no evil thing and a wise man's heart discerneth both time and judgment
because to every purpose there is time and judgment therefore the misery of man is great upon him
for he knoweth not that which shall be for who can tell him when it shall be
there is no man that hath power over the spirit to retain the spirit neither hath he power in the day of death and there is no discharge in that war neither shall wickedness deliver those that are given to it
all this have i seen and applied my heart unto every work that is done under the sun there is a time wherein one man ruleth over another to his own hurt
and so i saw the wicked buried who had come and gone from the place of the holy and they were forgotten in the city where they had so done this is also vanity
because sentence against an evil work is not executed speedily therefore the heart of the sons of men is fully set in them to do evil
though a sinner do evil an hundred times and his days be prolonged yet surely i know that it shall be well with them that fear god which fear before him
but it shall not be well with the wicked neither shall he prolong his days which are as a shadow because he feareth not before god
there is a vanity which is done upon the earth that there be just men unto whom it happeneth according to the work of the wicked again there be wicked men to whom it happeneth according to the work of the righteous i said that this also is vanity
then i commended mirth because a man hath no better thing under the sun than to eat and to drink and to be merry for that shall abide with him of his labour the days of his life which god giveth him under the sun
when i applied mine heart to know wisdom and to see the business that is done upon the earth for also there is that neither day nor night seeth sleep with his eyes
then i beheld all the work of god that a man cannot find out the work that is done under the sun because though a man labour to seek it out yet he shall not find it yea farther though a wise man think to know it yet shall he not be able to find it
for all this i considered in my heart even to declare all this that the righteous and the wise and their works are in the hand of god no man knoweth either love or hatred by all that is before them
all things come alike to all there is one event to the righteous and to the wicked to the good and to the clean and to the unclean to him that sacrificeth and to him that sacrificeth not as is the good so is the sinner and he that sweareth as he that feareth an oath
this is an evil among all things that are done under the sun that there is one event unto all yea also the heart of the sons of men is full of evil and madness is in their heart while they live and after that they go to the dead
for to him that is joined to all the living there is hope for a living dog is better than a dead lion
for the living know that they shall die but the dead know not any thing neither have they any more a reward for the memory of them is forgotten
also their love and their hatred and their envy is now perished neither have they any more a portion for ever in any thing that is done under the sun
go thy way eat thy bread with joy and drink thy wine with a merry heart for god now accepteth thy works
let thy garments be always white and let thy head lack no ointment
live joyfully with the wife whom thou lovest all the days of the life of thy vanity which he hath given thee under the sun all the days of thy vanity for that is thy portion in this life and in thy labour which thou takest under the sun
whatsoever thy hand findeth to do do it with thy might for there is no work nor device nor knowledge nor wisdom in the grave whither thou goest
i returned and saw under the sun that the race is not to the swift nor the battle to the strong neither yet bread to the wise nor yet riches to men of understanding nor yet favour to men of skill but time and chance happeneth to them all
for man also knoweth not his time as the fishes that are taken in an evil net and as the birds that are caught in the snare so are the sons of men snared in an evil time when it falleth suddenly upon them
this wisdom have i seen also under the sun and it seemed great unto me
there was a little city and few men within it and there came a great king against it and besieged it and built great bulwarks against it
now there was found in it a poor wise man and he by his wisdom delivered the city yet no man remembered that same poor man
then said i wisdom is better than strength nevertheless the poor man's wisdom is despised and his words are not heard
the words of wise men are heard in quiet more than the cry of him that ruleth among fools
wisdom is better than weapons of war but one sinner destroyeth much good
dead flies cause the ointment of the apothecary to send forth a stinking savour so doth a little folly him that is in reputation for wisdom and honour
a wise man's heart is at his right hand but a fool's heart at his left
yea also when he that is a fool walketh by the way his wisdom faileth him and he saith to every one that he is a fool
if the spirit of the ruler rise up against thee leave not thy place for yielding pacifieth great offences
there is an evil which i have seen under the sun as an error which proceedeth from the ruler
folly is set in great dignity and the rich sit in low place
i have seen servants upon horses and princes walking as servants upon the earth
he that diggeth a pit shall fall into it and whoso breaketh an hedge a serpent shall bite him
whoso removeth stones shall be hurt therewith and he that cleaveth wood shall be endangered thereby
if the iron be blunt and he do not whet the edge then must he put to more strength but wisdom is profitable to direct
surely the serpent will bite without enchantment and a babbler is no better
the words of a wise man's mouth are gracious but the lips of a fool will swallow up himself
the beginning of the words of his mouth is foolishness and the end of his talk is mischievous madness
a fool also is full of words a man cannot tell what shall be and what shall be after him who can tell him
the labour of the foolish wearieth every one of them because he knoweth not how to go to the city
woe to thee o land when thy king is a child and thy princes eat in the morning
blessed art thou o land when thy king is the son of nobles and thy princes eat in due season for strength and not for drunkenness
by much slothfulness the building decayeth and through idleness of the hands the house droppeth through
a feast is made for laughter and wine maketh merry but money answereth all things
curse not the king no not in thy thought and curse not the rich in thy bedchamber for a bird of the air shall carry the voice and that which hath wings shall tell the matter
cast thy bread upon the waters for thou shalt find it after many days
give a portion to seven and also to eight for thou knowest not what evil shall be upon the earth
if the clouds be full of rain they empty themselves upon the earth and if the tree fall toward the south or toward the north in the place where the tree falleth there it shall be
he that observeth the wind shall not sow and he that regardeth the clouds shall not reap
as thou knowest not what is the way of the spirit nor how the bones do grow in the womb of her that is with child even so thou knowest not the works of god who maketh all
in the morning sow thy seed and in the evening withhold not thine hand for thou knowest not whether shall prosper either this or that or whether they both shall be alike good
truly the light is sweet and a pleasant thing it is for the eyes to behold the sun
but if a man live many years and rejoice in them all yet let him remember the days of darkness for they shall be many all that cometh is vanity
rejoice o young man in thy youth and let thy heart cheer thee in the days of thy youth and walk in the ways of thine heart and in the sight of thine eyes but know thou that for all these things god will bring thee into judgment
therefore remove sorrow from thy heart and put away evil from thy flesh for childhood and youth are vanity
remember now thy creator in the days of thy youth while the evil days come not nor the years draw nigh when thou shalt say i have no pleasure in them
while the sun or the light or the moon or the stars be not darkened nor the clouds return after the rain
in the day when the keepers of the house shall tremble and the strong men shall bow themselves and the grinders cease because they are few and those that look out of the windows be darkened
and the doors shall be shut in the streets when the sound of the grinding is low and he shall rise up at the voice of the bird and all the daughters of musick shall be brought low
also when they shall be afraid of that which is high and fears shall be in the way and the almond tree shall flourish and the grasshopper shall be a burden and desire shall fail because man goeth to his long home and the mourners go about the streets
or ever the silver cord be loosed or the golden bowl be broken or the pitcher be broken at the fountain or the wheel broken at the cistern
then shall the dust return to the earth as it was and the spirit shall return unto god who gave it
vanity of vanities saith the preacher all is vanity
and moreover because the preacher was wise he still taught the people knowledge yea he gave good heed and sought out and set in order many proverbs
the preacher sought to find out acceptable words and that which was written was upright even words of truth
the words of the wise are as goads and as nails fastened by the masters of assemblies which are given from one shepherd
and further by these my son be admonished of making many books there is no end and much study is a weariness of the flesh
let us hear the conclusion of the whole matter fear god and keep his commandments for this is the whole duty of man
for god shall bring every work into judgment with every secret thing whether it be good or whether it be evil
the song of songs which is solomon's
let him kiss me with the kisses of his mouth for thy love is better than wine
because of the savour of thy good ointments thy name is as ointment poured forth therefore do the virgins love thee
draw me we will run after thee the king hath brought me into his chambers we will be glad and rejoice in thee we will remember thy love more than wine the upright love thee
i am black but comely o ye daughters of jerusalem as the tents of kedar as the curtains of solomon
look not upon me because i am black because the sun hath looked upon me my mother's children were angry with me they made me the keeper of the vineyards but mine own vineyard have i not kept
tell me o thou whom my soul loveth where thou feedest where thou makest thy flock to rest at noon for why should i be as one that turneth aside by the flocks of thy companions
if thou know not o thou fairest among women go thy way forth by the footsteps of the flock and feed thy kids beside the shepherds tents
i have compared thee o my love to a company of horses in pharaoh's chariots
thy cheeks are comely with rows of jewels thy neck with chains of gold
we will make thee borders of gold with studs of silver
while the king sitteth at his table my spikenard sendeth forth the smell thereof
a bundle of myrrh is my wellbeloved unto me he shall lie all night betwixt my breasts
my beloved is unto me as a cluster of camphire in the vineyards of engedi
behold thou art fair my love behold thou art fair thou hast doves eyes
behold thou art fair my beloved yea pleasant also our bed is green
the beams of our house are cedar and our rafters of fir
i am the rose of sharon and the lily of the valleys
as the lily among thorns so is my love among the daughters
as the apple tree among the trees of the wood so is my beloved among the sons i sat down under his shadow with great delight and his fruit was sweet to my taste
he brought me to the banqueting house and his banner over me was love
stay me with flagons comfort me with apples for i am sick of love
his left hand is under my head and his right hand doth embrace me
i charge you o ye daughters of jerusalem by the roes and by the hinds of the field that ye stir not up nor awake my love till he please
the voice of my beloved behold he cometh leaping upon the mountains skipping upon the hills
my beloved is like a roe or a young hart behold he standeth behind our wall he looketh forth at the windows shewing himself through the lattice
my beloved spake and said unto me rise up my love my fair one and come away
for lo the winter is past the rain is over and gone
the flowers appear on the earth the time of the singing of birds is come and the voice of the turtle is heard in our land
the fig tree putteth forth her green figs and the vines with the tender grape give a good smell arise my love my fair one and come away
o my dove that art in the clefts of the rock in the secret places of the stairs let me see thy countenance let me hear thy voice for sweet is thy voice and thy countenance is comely
take us the foxes the little foxes that spoil the vines for our vines have tender grapes
my beloved is mine and i am his he feedeth among the lilies
until the day break and the shadows flee away turn my beloved and be thou like a roe or a young hart upon the mountains of bether
by night on my bed i sought him whom my soul loveth i sought him but i found him not
i will rise now and go about the city in the streets and in the broad ways i will seek him whom my soul loveth i sought him but i found him not
the watchmen that go about the city found me to whom i said saw ye him whom my soul loveth
it was but a little that i passed from them but i found him whom my soul loveth i held him and would not let him go until i had brought him into my mother's house and into the chamber of her that conceived me
i charge you o ye daughters of jerusalem by the roes and by the hinds of the field that ye stir not up nor awake my love till he please
who is this that cometh out of the wilderness like pillars of smoke perfumed with myrrh and frankincense with all powders of the merchant
behold his bed which is solomon's threescore valiant men are about it of the valiant of israel
they all hold swords being expert in war every man hath his sword upon his thigh because of fear in the night
king solomon made himself a chariot of the wood of lebanon
he made the pillars thereof of silver the bottom thereof of gold the covering of it of purple the midst thereof being paved with love for the daughters of jerusalem
go forth o ye daughters of zion and behold king solomon with the crown wherewith his mother crowned him in the day of his espousals and in the day of the gladness of his heart
behold thou art fair my love behold thou art fair thou hast doves eyes within thy locks thy hair is as a flock of goats that appear from mount gilead
thy teeth are like a flock of sheep that are even shorn which came up from the washing whereof every one bear twins and none is barren among them
thy lips are like a thread of scarlet and thy speech is comely thy temples are like a piece of a pomegranate within thy locks
thy neck is like the tower of david builded for an armoury whereon there hang a thousand bucklers all shields of mighty men
thy two breasts are like two young roes that are twins which feed among the lilies
until the day break and the shadows flee away i will get me to the mountain of myrrh and to the hill of frankincense
thou art all fair my love there is no spot in thee
come with me from lebanon my spouse with me from lebanon look from the top of amana from the top of shenir and hermon from the lions dens from the mountains of the leopards
thou hast ravished my heart my sister my spouse thou hast ravished my heart with one of thine eyes with one chain of thy neck
how fair is thy love my sister my spouse how much better is thy love than wine and the smell of thine ointments than all spices
thy lips o my spouse drop as the honeycomb honey and milk are under thy tongue and the smell of thy garments is like the smell of lebanon
a garden inclosed is my sister my spouse a spring shut up a fountain sealed
thy plants are an orchard of pomegranates with pleasant fruits camphire with spikenard
spikenard and saffron calamus and cinnamon with all trees of frankincense myrrh and aloes with all the chief spices
a fountain of gardens a well of living waters and streams from lebanon
