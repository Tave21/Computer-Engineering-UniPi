 which let thy wiseness fear hold off thy hand
king claudius pluck them asunder
queen gertrude hamlet hamlet
all gentlemen
horatio good my lord be quiet
 the attendants part them and they come out of the grave
hamlet why i will fight with him upon this theme
 until my eyelids will no longer wag
queen gertrude o my son what theme
hamlet i loved ophelia forty thousand brothers
 could not with all their quantity of love
 make up my sum what wilt thou do for her
king claudius o he is mad laertes
queen gertrude for love of god forbear him
hamlet swounds show me what thou'lt do
 woo't weep woo't fight woo't fast woo't tear thyself
 woo't drink up eisel eat a crocodile
 i'll do't dost thou come here to whine
 to outface me with leaping in her grave
 be buried quick with her and so will i
 and if thou prate of mountains let them throw
 millions of acres on us till our ground
 singeing his pate against the burning zone
 make ossa like a wart nay an thou'lt mouth
 i'll rant as well as thou
queen gertrude this is mere madness
 and thus awhile the fit will work on him
 anon as patient as the female dove
 when that her golden couplets are disclosed
 his silence will sit drooping
hamlet hear you sir
 what is the reason that you use me thus
 i loved you ever but it is no matter
 let hercules himself do what he may
 the cat will mew and dog will have his day
 exit
king claudius i pray you good horatio wait upon him
 exit horatio
 to laertes
 strengthen your patience in our last night's speech
 we'll put the matter to the present push
 good gertrude set some watch over your son
 this grave shall have a living monument
 an hour of quiet shortly shall we see
 till then in patience our proceeding be
 exeunt
 hamlet
act v
scene ii a hall in the castle
 enter hamlet and horatio
hamlet so much for this sir now shall you see the other
 you do remember all the circumstance
horatio remember it my lord
hamlet sir in my heart there was a kind of fighting
 that would not let me sleep methought i lay
 worse than the mutines in the bilboes rashly
 and praised be rashness for it let us know
 our indiscretion sometimes serves us well
 when our deep plots do pall and that should teach us
 there's a divinity that shapes our ends
 roughhew them how we will
horatio that is most certain
hamlet up from my cabin
 my seagown scarf'd about me in the dark
 groped i to find out them had my desire
 finger'd their packet and in fine withdrew
 to mine own room again making so bold
 my fears forgetting manners to unseal
 their grand commission where i found horatio
 o royal knaveryan exact command
 larded with many several sorts of reasons
 importing denmark's health and england's too
 with ho such bugs and goblins in my life
 that on the supervise no leisure bated
 no not to stay the grinding of the axe
 my head should be struck off
horatio is't possible
hamlet here's the commission read it at more leisure
 but wilt thou hear me how i did proceed
horatio i beseech you
hamlet being thus benetted round with villanies
 ere i could make a prologue to my brains
 they had begun the playi sat me down
 devised a new commission wrote it fair
 i once did hold it as our statists do
 a baseness to write fair and labour'd much
 how to forget that learning but sir now
 it did me yeoman's service wilt thou know
 the effect of what i wrote
horatio ay good my lord
hamlet an earnest conjuration from the king
 as england was his faithful tributary
 as love between them like the palm might flourish
 as peace should stiff her wheaten garland wear
 and stand a comma tween their amities
 and many suchlike as'es of great charge
 that on the view and knowing of these contents
 without debatement further more or less
 he should the bearers put to sudden death
 not shrivingtime allow'd
horatio how was this seal'd
hamlet why even in that was heaven ordinant
 i had my father's signet in my purse
 which was the model of that danish seal
 folded the writ up in form of the other
 subscribed it gave't the impression placed it safely
 the changeling never known now the next day
 was our seafight and what to this was sequent
 thou know'st already
horatio so guildenstern and rosencrantz go to't
hamlet why man they did make love to this employment
 they are not near my conscience their defeat
 does by their own insinuation grow
 tis dangerous when the baser nature comes
 between the pass and fell incensed points
 of mighty opposites
horatio why what a king is this
hamlet does it not think'st thee stand me now upon
 he that hath kill'd my king and whored my mother
 popp'd in between the election and my hopes
 thrown out his angle for my proper life
 and with such cozenageis't not perfect conscience
 to quit him with this arm and is't not to be damn'd
 to let this canker of our nature come
 in further evil
horatio it must be shortly known to him from england
 what is the issue of the business there
hamlet it will be short the interim is mine
 and a man's life's no more than to say one'
 but i am very sorry good horatio
 that to laertes i forgot myself
 for by the image of my cause i see
 the portraiture of his i'll court his favours
 but sure the bravery of his grief did put me
 into a towering passion
horatio peace who comes here
 enter osric
osric your lordship is right welcome back to denmark
hamlet i humbly thank you sir dost know this waterfly
horatio no my good lord
hamlet thy state is the more gracious for tis a vice to
 know him he hath much land and fertile let a
 beast be lord of beasts and his crib shall stand at
 the king's mess tis a chough but as i say
 spacious in the possession of dirt
osric sweet lord if your lordship were at leisure i
 should impart a thing to you from his majesty
hamlet i will receive it sir with all diligence of
 spirit put your bonnet to his right use tis for the head
osric i thank your lordship it is very hot
hamlet no believe me tis very cold the wind is
 northerly
osric it is indifferent cold my lord indeed
hamlet but yet methinks it is very sultry and hot for my
 complexion
osric exceedingly my lord it is very sultryas
 twerei cannot tell how but my lord his
 majesty bade me signify to you that he has laid a
 great wager on your head sir this is the matter
hamlet i beseech you remember
 hamlet moves him to put on his hat
osric nay good my lord for mine ease in good faith
 sir here is newly come to court laertes believe
 me an absolute gentleman full of most excellent
 differences of very soft society and great showing
 indeed to speak feelingly of him he is the card or
 calendar of gentry for you shall find in him the
 continent of what part a gentleman would see
hamlet sir his definement suffers no perdition in you
 though i know to divide him inventorially would
 dizzy the arithmetic of memory and yet but yaw
 neither in respect of his quick sail but in the
 verity of extolment i take him to be a soul of
 great article and his infusion of such dearth and
 rareness as to make true diction of him his
 semblable is his mirror and who else would trace
 him his umbrage nothing more
osric your lordship speaks most infallibly of him
hamlet the concernancy sir why do we wrap the gentleman
 in our more rawer breath
osric sir
horatio is't not possible to understand in another tongue
 you will do't sir really
hamlet what imports the nomination of this gentleman
osric of laertes
horatio his purse is empty already all's golden words are spent
hamlet of him sir
osric i know you are not ignorant
hamlet i would you did sir yet in faith if you did
 it would not much approve me well sir
osric you are not ignorant of what excellence laertes is
hamlet i dare not confess that lest i should compare with
 him in excellence but to know a man well were to
 know himself
osric i mean sir for his weapon but in the imputation
 laid on him by them in his meed he's unfellowed
hamlet what's his weapon
osric rapier and dagger
hamlet that's two of his weapons but well
osric the king sir hath wagered with him six barbary
