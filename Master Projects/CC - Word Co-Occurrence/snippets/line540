 i must uneasy make lest too light winning
 make the prize light
 to ferdinand
 one word more i charge thee
 that thou attend me thou dost here usurp
 the name thou owest not and hast put thyself
 upon this island as a spy to win it
 from me the lord on't
ferdinand no as i am a man
miranda there's nothing ill can dwell in such a temple
 if the ill spirit have so fair a house
 good things will strive to dwell with't
prospero follow me
 speak not you for him he's a traitor come
 i'll manacle thy neck and feet together
 seawater shalt thou drink thy food shall be
 the freshbrook muscles wither'd roots and husks
 wherein the acorn cradled follow
ferdinand no
 i will resist such entertainment till
 mine enemy has more power
 draws and is charmed from moving
miranda o dear father
 make not too rash a trial of him for
 he's gentle and not fearful
prospero what i say
 my foot my tutor put thy sword up traitor
 who makest a show but darest not strike thy conscience
 is so possess'd with guilt come from thy ward
 for i can here disarm thee with this stick
 and make thy weapon drop
miranda beseech you father
prospero hence hang not on my garments
miranda sir have pity
 i'll be his surety
prospero silence one word more
 shall make me chide thee if not hate thee what
 an advocate for an imposter hush
 thou think'st there is no more such shapes as he
 having seen but him and caliban foolish wench
 to the most of men this is a caliban
 and they to him are angels
miranda my affections
 are then most humble i have no ambition
 to see a goodlier man
prospero come on obey
 thy nerves are in their infancy again
 and have no vigour in them
ferdinand so they are
 my spirits as in a dream are all bound up
 my father's loss the weakness which i feel
 the wreck of all my friends nor this man's threats
 to whom i am subdued are but light to me
 might i but through my prison once a day
 behold this maid all corners else o the earth
 let liberty make use of space enough
 have i in such a prison
prospero aside it works
 to ferdinand
 come on
 thou hast done well fine ariel
 to ferdinand
 follow me
 to ariel
 hark what thou else shalt do me
miranda be of comfort
 my father's of a better nature sir
 than he appears by speech this is unwonted
 which now came from him
prospero thou shalt be free
 as mountain winds but then exactly do
 all points of my command
ariel to the syllable
prospero come follow speak not for him
 exeunt
 the tempest
act ii
scene i another part of the island
 enter alonso sebastian antonio gonzalo
 adrian francisco and others
gonzalo beseech you sir be merry you have cause
 so have we all of joy for our escape
 is much beyond our loss our hint of woe
 is common every day some sailor's wife
 the masters of some merchant and the merchant
 have just our theme of woe but for the miracle
 i mean our preservation few in millions
 can speak like us then wisely good sir weigh
 our sorrow with our comfort
alonso prithee peace
sebastian he receives comfort like cold porridge
antonio the visitor will not give him o'er so
sebastian look he's winding up the watch of his wit
 by and by it will strike
gonzalo sir
sebastian one tell
gonzalo when every grief is entertain'd that's offer'd
 comes to the entertainer
sebastian a dollar
gonzalo dolour comes to him indeed you
 have spoken truer than you purposed
sebastian you have taken it wiselier than i meant you should
gonzalo therefore my lord
antonio fie what a spendthrift is he of his tongue
alonso i prithee spare
gonzalo well i have done but yet
sebastian he will be talking
antonio which of he or adrian for a good
 wager first begins to crow
sebastian the old cock
antonio the cockerel
sebastian done the wager
antonio a laughter
sebastian a match
adrian though this island seem to be desert
sebastian ha ha ha so you're paid
adrian uninhabitable and almost inaccessible
sebastian yet
adrian yet
antonio he could not miss't
adrian it must needs be of subtle tender and delicate
 temperance
antonio temperance was a delicate wench
sebastian ay and a subtle as he most learnedly delivered
adrian the air breathes upon us here most sweetly
sebastian as if it had lungs and rotten ones
antonio or as twere perfumed by a fen
gonzalo here is everything advantageous to life
antonio true save means to live
sebastian of that there's none or little
gonzalo how lush and lusty the grass looks how green
antonio the ground indeed is tawny
sebastian with an eye of green in't
antonio he misses not much
sebastian no he doth but mistake the truth totally
gonzalo but the rarity of it iswhich is indeed almost
 beyond credit
sebastian as many vouched rarities are
gonzalo that our garments being as they were drenched in
 the sea hold notwithstanding their freshness and
 glosses being rather newdyed than stained with
 salt water
antonio if but one of his pockets could speak would it not
 say he lies
sebastian ay or very falsely pocket up his report
gonzalo methinks our garments are now as fresh as when we
 put them on first in afric at the marriage of
 the king's fair daughter claribel to the king of tunis
sebastian twas a sweet marriage and we prosper well in our return
adrian tunis was never graced before with such a paragon to
 their queen
gonzalo not since widow dido's time
antonio widow a pox o that how came that widow in
 widow dido
sebastian what if he had said widower aeneas too good lord
 how you take it
adrian widow dido said you you make me study of that
 she was of carthage not of tunis
gonzalo this tunis sir was carthage
adrian carthage
gonzalo i assure you carthage
sebastian his word is more than the miraculous harp he hath
 raised the wall and houses too
antonio what impossible matter will he make easy next
sebastian i think he will carry this island home in his pocket
 and give it his son for an apple
antonio and sowing the kernels of it in the sea bring
 forth more islands
gonzalo ay
antonio why in good time
gonzalo sir we were talking that our garments seem now
 as fresh as when we were at tunis at the marriage
 of your daughter who is now queen
antonio and the rarest that e'er came there
sebastian bate i beseech you widow dido
antonio o widow dido ay widow dido
gonzalo is not sir my doublet as fresh as the first day i
 wore it i mean in a sort
antonio that sort was well fished for
gonzalo when i wore it at your daughter's marriage
alonso you cram these words into mine ears against
 the stomach of my sense would i had never
 married my daughter there for coming thence
 my son is lost and in my rate she too
 who is so far from italy removed
 i ne'er again shall see her o thou mine heir
 of naples and of milan what strange fish
 hath made his meal on thee
francisco sir he may live
 i saw him beat the surges under him
 and ride upon their backs he trod the water
 whose enmity he flung aside and breasted
 the surge most swoln that met him his bold head
 bove the contentious waves he kept and oar'd
 himself with his good arms in lusty stroke
 to the shore that o'er his waveworn basis bow'd
 as stooping to relieve him i not doubt
 he came alive to land
alonso no no he's gone
sebastian sir you may thank yourself for this great loss
