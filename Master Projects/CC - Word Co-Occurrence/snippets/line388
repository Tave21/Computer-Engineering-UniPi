 taken with the cramp was drowned and the foolish
 coroners of that age found it was hero of sestos'
 but these are all lies men have died from time to
 time and worms have eaten them but not for love
orlando i would not have my right rosalind of this mind
 for i protest her frown might kill me
rosalind by this hand it will not kill a fly but come now
 i will be your rosalind in a more comingon
 disposition and ask me what you will i will grant
 it
orlando then love me rosalind
rosalind yes faith will i fridays and saturdays and all
orlando and wilt thou have me
rosalind ay and twenty such
orlando what sayest thou
rosalind are you not good
orlando i hope so
rosalind why then can one desire too much of a good thing
 come sister you shall be the priest and marry us
 give me your hand orlando what do you say sister
orlando pray thee marry us
celia i cannot say the words
rosalind you must begin will you orlando'
celia go to will you orlando have to wife this rosalind
orlando i will
rosalind ay but when
orlando why now as fast as she can marry us
rosalind then you must say i take thee rosalind for wife'
orlando i take thee rosalind for wife
rosalind i might ask you for your commission but i do take
 thee orlando for my husband there's a girl goes
 before the priest and certainly a woman's thought
 runs before her actions
orlando so do all thoughts they are winged
rosalind now tell me how long you would have her after you
 have possessed her
orlando for ever and a day
rosalind say a day without the ever no no orlando
 men are april when they woo december when they wed
 maids are may when they are maids but the sky
 changes when they are wives i will be more jealous
 of thee than a barbary cockpigeon over his hen
 more clamorous than a parrot against rain more
 newfangled than an ape more giddy in my desires
 than a monkey i will weep for nothing like diana
 in the fountain and i will do that when you are
 disposed to be merry i will laugh like a hyen and
 that when thou art inclined to sleep
orlando but will my rosalind do so
rosalind by my life she will do as i do
orlando o but she is wise
rosalind or else she could not have the wit to do this the
 wiser the waywarder make the doors upon a woman's
 wit and it will out at the casement shut that and
 twill out at the keyhole stop that twill fly
 with the smoke out at the chimney
orlando a man that had a wife with such a wit he might say
 wit whither wilt'
rosalind nay you might keep that cheque for it till you met
 your wife's wit going to your neighbour's bed
orlando and what wit could wit have to excuse that
rosalind marry to say she came to seek you there you shall
 never take her without her answer unless you take
 her without her tongue o that woman that cannot
 make her fault her husband's occasion let her
 never nurse her child herself for she will breed
 it like a fool
orlando for these two hours rosalind i will leave thee
rosalind alas dear love i cannot lack thee two hours
orlando i must attend the duke at dinner by two o'clock i
 will be with thee again
rosalind ay go your ways go your ways i knew what you
 would prove my friends told me as much and i
 thought no less that flattering tongue of yours
 won me tis but one cast away and so come
 death two o'clock is your hour
orlando ay sweet rosalind
rosalind by my troth and in good earnest and so god mend
 me and by all pretty oaths that are not dangerous
 if you break one jot of your promise or come one
 minute behind your hour i will think you the most
 pathetical breakpromise and the most hollow lover
 and the most unworthy of her you call rosalind that
 may be chosen out of the gross band of the
 unfaithful therefore beware my censure and keep
 your promise
orlando with no less religion than if thou wert indeed my
 rosalind so adieu
rosalind well time is the old justice that examines all such
 offenders and let time try adieu
 exit orlando
celia you have simply misused our sex in your loveprate
 we must have your doublet and hose plucked over your
 head and show the world what the bird hath done to
 her own nest
rosalind o coz coz coz my pretty little coz that thou
 didst know how many fathom deep i am in love but
 it cannot be sounded my affection hath an unknown
 bottom like the bay of portugal
celia or rather bottomless that as fast as you pour
 affection in it runs out
rosalind no that same wicked bastard of venus that was begot
 of thought conceived of spleen and born of madness
 that blind rascally boy that abuses every one's eyes
 because his own are out let him be judge how deep i
 am in love i'll tell thee aliena i cannot be out
 of the sight of orlando i'll go find a shadow and
 sigh till he come
celia and i'll sleep
 exeunt
 as you like it
act iv
scene ii the forest
 enter jaques lords and foresters
jaques which is he that killed the deer
a lord sir it was i
jaques let's present him to the duke like a roman
 conqueror and it would do well to set the deer's
 horns upon his head for a branch of victory have
 you no song forester for this purpose
forester yes sir
jaques sing it tis no matter how it be in tune so it
 make noise enough
 
 song
forester what shall he have that kill'd the deer
 his leather skin and horns to wear
 then sing him home
 the rest shall bear this burden
 take thou no scorn to wear the horn
 it was a crest ere thou wast born
 thy father's father wore it
 and thy father bore it
 the horn the horn the lusty horn
 is not a thing to laugh to scorn
 exeunt
 as you like it
act iv
scene iii the forest
 enter rosalind and celia
rosalind how say you now is it not past two o'clock and
 here much orlando
celia i warrant you with pure love and troubled brain he
 hath ta'en his bow and arrows and is gone forth to
 sleep look who comes here
 enter silvius
silvius my errand is to you fair youth
 my gentle phebe bid me give you this
 i know not the contents but as i guess
 by the stern brow and waspish action
 which she did use as she was writing of it
 it bears an angry tenor pardon me
 i am but as a guiltless messenger
rosalind patience herself would startle at this letter
 and play the swaggerer bear this bear all
 she says i am not fair that i lack manners
 she calls me proud and that she could not love me
 were man as rare as phoenix od's my will
 her love is not the hare that i do hunt
 why writes she so to me well shepherd well
 this is a letter of your own device
silvius no i protest i know not the contents
 phebe did write it
rosalind come come you are a fool
 and turn'd into the extremity of love
 i saw her hand she has a leathern hand
 a freestonecolour'd hand i verily did think
 that her old gloves were on but twas her hands
 she has a huswife's hand but that's no matter
 i say she never did invent this letter
 this is a man's invention and his hand
silvius sure it is hers
rosalind why tis a boisterous and a cruel style
 a style forchallengers why she defies me
 like turk to christian women's gentle brain
 could not drop forth such giantrude invention
 such ethiope words blacker in their effect
 than in their countenance will you hear the letter
silvius so please you for i never heard it yet
 yet heard too much of phebe's cruelty
rosalind she phebes me mark how the tyrant writes
 reads
 art thou god to shepherd turn'd
 that a maiden's heart hath burn'd
 can a woman rail thus
silvius call you this railing
rosalind reads
 why thy godhead laid apart
 warr'st thou with a woman's heart
 did you ever hear such railing
 whiles the eye of man did woo me
 that could do no vengeance to me
 meaning me a beast
 if the scorn of your bright eyne
 have power to raise such love in mine
 alack in me what strange effect
 would they work in mild aspect
 whiles you chid me i did love
 how then might your prayers move
 he that brings this love to thee
