in the fear of the lord is strong confidence and his children shall have a place of refuge
the fear of the lord is a fountain of life to depart from the snares of death
in the multitude of people is the king's honour but in the want of people is the destruction of the prince
he that is slow to wrath is of great understanding but he that is hasty of spirit exalteth folly
a sound heart is the life of the flesh but envy the rottenness of the bones
he that oppresseth the poor reproacheth his maker but he that honoureth him hath mercy on the poor
the wicked is driven away in his wickedness but the righteous hath hope in his death
wisdom resteth in the heart of him that hath understanding but that which is in the midst of fools is made known
righteousness exalteth a nation but sin is a reproach to any people
the king's favour is toward a wise servant but his wrath is against him that causeth shame
a soft answer turneth away wrath but grievous words stir up anger
the tongue of the wise useth knowledge aright but the mouth of fools poureth out foolishness
the eyes of the lord are in every place beholding the evil and the good
a wholesome tongue is a tree of life but perverseness therein is a breach in the spirit
a fool despiseth his father's instruction but he that regardeth reproof is prudent
in the house of the righteous is much treasure but in the revenues of the wicked is trouble
the lips of the wise disperse knowledge but the heart of the foolish doeth not so
the sacrifice of the wicked is an abomination to the lord but the prayer of the upright is his delight
the way of the wicked is an abomination unto the lord but he loveth him that followeth after righteousness
correction is grievous unto him that forsaketh the way and he that hateth reproof shall die
hell and destruction are before the lord how much more then the hearts of the children of men
a scorner loveth not one that reproveth him neither will he go unto the wise
a merry heart maketh a cheerful countenance but by sorrow of the heart the spirit is broken
the heart of him that hath understanding seeketh knowledge but the mouth of fools feedeth on foolishness
all the days of the afflicted are evil but he that is of a merry heart hath a continual feast
better is little with the fear of the lord than great treasure and trouble therewith
better is a dinner of herbs where love is than a stalled ox and hatred therewith
a wrathful man stirreth up strife but he that is slow to anger appeaseth strife
the way of the slothful man is as an hedge of thorns but the way of the righteous is made plain
a wise son maketh a glad father but a foolish man despiseth his mother
folly is joy to him that is destitute of wisdom but a man of understanding walketh uprightly
without counsel purposes are disappointed but in the multitude of counsellors they are established
a man hath joy by the answer of his mouth and a word spoken in due season how good is it
the way of life is above to the wise that he may depart from hell beneath
the lord will destroy the house of the proud but he will establish the border of the widow
the thoughts of the wicked are an abomination to the lord but the words of the pure are pleasant words
he that is greedy of gain troubleth his own house but he that hateth gifts shall live
the heart of the righteous studieth to answer but the mouth of the wicked poureth out evil things
the lord is far from the wicked but he heareth the prayer of the righteous
the light of the eyes rejoiceth the heart and a good report maketh the bones fat
the ear that heareth the reproof of life abideth among the wise
he that refuseth instruction despiseth his own soul but he that heareth reproof getteth understanding
the fear of the lord is the instruction of wisdom and before honour is humility
the preparations of the heart in man and the answer of the tongue is from the lord
all the ways of a man are clean in his own eyes but the lord weigheth the spirits
commit thy works unto the lord and thy thoughts shall be established
the lord hath made all things for himself yea even the wicked for the day of evil
every one that is proud in heart is an abomination to the lord though hand join in hand he shall not be unpunished
by mercy and truth iniquity is purged and by the fear of the lord men depart from evil
when a man's ways please the lord he maketh even his enemies to be at peace with him
better is a little with righteousness than great revenues without right
a man's heart deviseth his way but the lord directeth his steps
a divine sentence is in the lips of the king his mouth transgresseth not in judgment
a just weight and balance are the lord's all the weights of the bag are his work
it is an abomination to kings to commit wickedness for the throne is established by righteousness
righteous lips are the delight of kings and they love him that speaketh right
the wrath of a king is as messengers of death but a wise man will pacify it
in the light of the king's countenance is life and his favour is as a cloud of the latter rain
how much better is it to get wisdom than gold and to get understanding rather to be chosen than silver
the highway of the upright is to depart from evil he that keepeth his way preserveth his soul
pride goeth before destruction and an haughty spirit before a fall
better it is to be of an humble spirit with the lowly than to divide the spoil with the proud
he that handleth a matter wisely shall find good and whoso trusteth in the lord happy is he
the wise in heart shall be called prudent and the sweetness of the lips increaseth learning
understanding is a wellspring of life unto him that hath it but the instruction of fools is folly
the heart of the wise teacheth his mouth and addeth learning to his lips
pleasant words are as an honeycomb sweet to the soul and health to the bones
there is a way that seemeth right unto a man but the end thereof are the ways of death
he that laboureth laboureth for himself for his mouth craveth it of him
an ungodly man diggeth up evil and in his lips there is as a burning fire
a froward man soweth strife and a whisperer separateth chief friends
a violent man enticeth his neighbour and leadeth him into the way that is not good
he shutteth his eyes to devise froward things moving his lips he bringeth evil to pass
the hoary head is a crown of glory if it be found in the way of righteousness
he that is slow to anger is better than the mighty and he that ruleth his spirit than he that taketh a city
the lot is cast into the lap but the whole disposing thereof is of the lord
better is a dry morsel and quietness therewith than an house full of sacrifices with strife
a wise servant shall have rule over a son that causeth shame and shall have part of the inheritance among the brethren
the fining pot is for silver and the furnace for gold but the lord trieth the hearts
a wicked doer giveth heed to false lips and a liar giveth ear to a naughty tongue
whoso mocketh the poor reproacheth his maker and he that is glad at calamities shall not be unpunished
children's children are the crown of old men and the glory of children are their fathers
excellent speech becometh not a fool much less do lying lips a prince
a gift is as a precious stone in the eyes of him that hath it whithersoever it turneth it prospereth
he that covereth a transgression seeketh love but he that repeateth a matter separateth very friends
a reproof entereth more into a wise man than an hundred stripes into a fool
an evil man seeketh only rebellion therefore a cruel messenger shall be sent against him
let a bear robbed of her whelps meet a man rather than a fool in his folly
whoso rewardeth evil for good evil shall not depart from his house
the beginning of strife is as when one letteth out water therefore leave off contention before it be meddled with
he that justifieth the wicked and he that condemneth the just even they both are abomination to the lord
wherefore is there a price in the hand of a fool to get wisdom seeing he hath no heart to it
a friend loveth at all times and a brother is born for adversity
a man void of understanding striketh hands and becometh surety in the presence of his friend
he loveth transgression that loveth strife and he that exalteth his gate seeketh destruction
he that hath a froward heart findeth no good and he that hath a perverse tongue falleth into mischief
he that begetteth a fool doeth it to his sorrow and the father of a fool hath no joy
a merry heart doeth good like a medicine but a broken spirit drieth the bones
a wicked man taketh a gift out of the bosom to pervert the ways of judgment
wisdom is before him that hath understanding but the eyes of a fool are in the ends of the earth
a foolish son is a grief to his father and bitterness to her that bare him
also to punish the just is not good nor to strike princes for equity
he that hath knowledge spareth his words and a man of understanding is of an excellent spirit
even a fool when he holdeth his peace is counted wise and he that shutteth his lips is esteemed a man of understanding
through desire a man having separated himself seeketh and intermeddleth with all wisdom
a fool hath no delight in understanding but that his heart may discover itself
when the wicked cometh then cometh also contempt and with ignominy reproach
the words of a man's mouth are as deep waters and the wellspring of wisdom as a flowing brook
it is not good to accept the person of the wicked to overthrow the righteous in judgment
a fool's lips enter into contention and his mouth calleth for strokes
a fool's mouth is his destruction and his lips are the snare of his soul
the words of a talebearer are as wounds and they go down into the innermost parts of the belly
he also that is slothful in his work is brother to him that is a great waster
the name of the lord is a strong tower the righteous runneth into it and is safe
the rich man's wealth is his strong city and as an high wall in his own conceit
before destruction the heart of man is haughty and before honour is humility
he that answereth a matter before he heareth it it is folly and shame unto him
the spirit of a man will sustain his infirmity but a wounded spirit who can bear
the heart of the prudent getteth knowledge and the ear of the wise seeketh knowledge
a man's gift maketh room for him and bringeth him before great men
he that is first in his own cause seemeth just but his neighbour cometh and searcheth him
the lot causeth contentions to cease and parteth between the mighty
a brother offended is harder to be won than a strong city and their contentions are like the bars of a castle
a man's belly shall be satisfied with the fruit of his mouth and with the increase of his lips shall he be filled
death and life are in the power of the tongue and they that love it shall eat the fruit thereof
whoso findeth a wife findeth a good thing and obtaineth favour of the lord
the poor useth intreaties but the rich answereth roughly
a man that hath friends must shew himself friendly and there is a friend that sticketh closer than a brother
better is the poor that walketh in his integrity than he that is perverse in his lips and is a fool
also that the soul be without knowledge it is not good and he that hasteth with his feet sinneth
the foolishness of man perverteth his way and his heart fretteth against the lord
wealth maketh many friends but the poor is separated from his neighbour
a false witness shall not be unpunished and he that speaketh lies shall not escape
many will intreat the favour of the prince and every man is a friend to him that giveth gifts
all the brethren of the poor do hate him how much more do his friends go far from him he pursueth them with words yet they are wanting to him
he that getteth wisdom loveth his own soul he that keepeth understanding shall find good
a false witness shall not be unpunished and he that speaketh lies shall perish
delight is not seemly for a fool much less for a servant to have rule over princes
the discretion of a man deferreth his anger and it is his glory to pass over a transgression
the king's wrath is as the roaring of a lion but his favour is as dew upon the grass
a foolish son is the calamity of his father and the contentions of a wife are a continual dropping
house and riches are the inheritance of fathers and a prudent wife is from the lord
slothfulness casteth into a deep sleep and an idle soul shall suffer hunger
he that keepeth the commandment keepeth his own soul but he that despiseth his ways shall die
he that hath pity upon the poor lendeth unto the lord and that which he hath given will he pay him again
chasten thy son while there is hope and let not thy soul spare for his crying
a man of great wrath shall suffer punishment for if thou deliver him yet thou must do it again
hear counsel and receive instruction that thou mayest be wise in thy latter end
there are many devices in a man's heart nevertheless the counsel of the lord that shall stand
the desire of a man is his kindness and a poor man is better than a liar
the fear of the lord tendeth to life and he that hath it shall abide satisfied he shall not be visited with evil
a slothful man hideth his hand in his bosom and will not so much as bring it to his mouth again
smite a scorner and the simple will beware and reprove one that hath understanding and he will understand knowledge
he that wasteth his father and chaseth away his mother is a son that causeth shame and bringeth reproach
cease my son to hear the instruction that causeth to err from the words of knowledge
an ungodly witness scorneth judgment and the mouth of the wicked devoureth iniquity
judgments are prepared for scorners and stripes for the back of fools
wine is a mocker strong drink is raging and whosoever is deceived thereby is not wise
the fear of a king is as the roaring of a lion whoso provoketh him to anger sinneth against his own soul
it is an honour for a man to cease from strife but every fool will be meddling
the sluggard will not plow by reason of the cold therefore shall he beg in harvest and have nothing
counsel in the heart of man is like deep water but a man of understanding will draw it out
most men will proclaim every one his own goodness but a faithful man who can find
the just man walketh in his integrity his children are blessed after him
a king that sitteth in the throne of judgment scattereth away all evil with his eyes
who can say i have made my heart clean i am pure from my sin
divers weights and divers measures both of them are alike abomination to the lord
even a child is known by his doings whether his work be pure and whether it be right
the hearing ear and the seeing eye the lord hath made even both of them
love not sleep lest thou come to poverty open thine eyes and thou shalt be satisfied with bread
it is naught it is naught saith the buyer but when he is gone his way then he boasteth
there is gold and a multitude of rubies but the lips of knowledge are a precious jewel
take his garment that is surety for a stranger and take a pledge of him for a strange woman
bread of deceit is sweet to a man but afterwards his mouth shall be filled with gravel
every purpose is established by counsel and with good advice make war
he that goeth about as a talebearer revealeth secrets therefore meddle not with him that flattereth with his lips
whoso curseth his father or his mother his lamp shall be put out in obscure darkness
an inheritance may be gotten hastily at the beginning but the end thereof shall not be blessed
say not thou i will recompense evil but wait on the lord and he shall save thee
divers weights are an abomination unto the lord and a false balance is not good
man's goings are of the lord how can a man then understand his own way
it is a snare to the man who devoureth that which is holy and after vows to make enquiry
a wise king scattereth the wicked and bringeth the wheel over them
the spirit of man is the candle of the lord searching all the inward parts of the belly
mercy and truth preserve the king and his throne is upholden by mercy
the glory of young men is their strength and the beauty of old men is the grey head
the blueness of a wound cleanseth away evil so do stripes the inward parts of the belly
the king's heart is in the hand of the lord as the rivers of water he turneth it whithersoever he will
every way of a man is right in his own eyes but the lord pondereth the hearts
to do justice and judgment is more acceptable to the lord than sacrifice
an high look and a proud heart and the plowing of the wicked is sin
the thoughts of the diligent tend only to plenteousness but of every one that is hasty only to want
the getting of treasures by a lying tongue is a vanity tossed to and fro of them that seek death
the robbery of the wicked shall destroy them because they refuse to do judgment
the way of man is froward and strange but as for the pure his work is right
it is better to dwell in a corner of the housetop than with a brawling woman in a wide house
the soul of the wicked desireth evil his neighbour findeth no favour in his eyes
when the scorner is punished the simple is made wise and when the wise is instructed he receiveth knowledge
the righteous man wisely considereth the house of the wicked but god overthroweth the wicked for their wickedness
whoso stoppeth his ears at the cry of the poor he also shall cry himself but shall not be heard
