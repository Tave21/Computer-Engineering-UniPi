 doth fat me with the very thoughts of it
 let fools do good and fair men call for grace
 aaron will have his soul black like his face
 exit
titus andronicus o here i lift this one hand up to heaven
 and bow this feeble ruin to the earth
 if any power pities wretched tears
 to that i call
 to lavinia
 what wilt thou kneel with me
 do then dear heart for heaven shall hear our prayers
 or with our sighs we'll breathe the welkin dim
 and stain the sun with fog as sometime clouds
 when they do hug him in their melting bosoms
marcus andronicus o brother speak with possibilities
 and do not break into these deep extremes
titus andronicus is not my sorrow deep having no bottom
 then be my passions bottomless with them
marcus andronicus but yet let reason govern thy lament
titus andronicus if there were reason for these miseries
 then into limits could i bind my woes
 when heaven doth weep doth not the earth o'erflow
 if the winds rage doth not the sea wax mad
 threatening the welkin with his bigswoln face
 and wilt thou have a reason for this coil
 i am the sea hark how her sighs do blow
 she is the weeping welkin i the earth
 then must my sea be moved with her sighs
 then must my earth with her continual tears
 become a deluge overflow'd and drown'd
 for why my bowels cannot hide her woes
 but like a drunkard must i vomit them
 then give me leave for losers will have leave
 to ease their stomachs with their bitter tongues
 enter a messenger with two heads and a hand
messenger worthy andronicus ill art thou repaid
 for that good hand thou sent'st the emperor
 here are the heads of thy two noble sons
 and here's thy hand in scorn to thee sent back
 thy griefs their sports thy resolution mock'd
 that woe is me to think upon thy woes
 more than remembrance of my father's death
 exit
marcus andronicus now let hot aetna cool in sicily
 and be my heart an everburning hell
 these miseries are more than may be borne
 to weep with them that weep doth ease some deal
 but sorrow flouted at is double death
lucius ah that this sight should make so deep a wound
 and yet detested life not shrink thereat
 that ever death should let life bear his name
 where life hath no more interest but to breathe
 lavinia kisses titus
marcus andronicus alas poor heart that kiss is comfortless
 as frozen water to a starved snake
titus andronicus when will this fearful slumber have an end
marcus andronicus now farewell flattery die andronicus
 thou dost not slumber see thy two sons heads
 thy warlike hand thy mangled daughter here
 thy other banish'd son with this dear sight
 struck pale and bloodless and thy brother i
 even like a stony image cold and numb
 ah now no more will i control thy griefs
 rend off thy silver hair thy other hand
 gnawing with thy teeth and be this dismal sight
 the closing up of our most wretched eyes
 now is a time to storm why art thou still
titus andronicus ha ha ha
marcus andronicus why dost thou laugh it fits not with this hour
titus andronicus why i have not another tear to shed
 besides this sorrow is an enemy
 and would usurp upon my watery eyes
 and make them blind with tributary tears
 then which way shall i find revenge's cave
 for these two heads do seem to speak to me
 and threat me i shall never come to bliss
 till all these mischiefs be return'd again
 even in their throats that have committed them
 come let me see what task i have to do
 you heavy people circle me about
 that i may turn me to each one of you
 and swear unto my soul to right your wrongs
 the vow is made come brother take a head
 and in this hand the other i will bear
 lavinia thou shalt be employ'd these arms
 bear thou my hand sweet wench between thy teeth
 as for thee boy go get thee from my sight
 thou art an exile and thou must not stay
 hie to the goths and raise an army there
 and if you love me as i think you do
 let's kiss and part for we have much to do
 exeunt titus marcus and lavinia
lucius farewell andronicus my noble father
 the wofull'st man that ever lived in rome
 farewell proud rome till lucius come again
 he leaves his pledges dearer than his life
 farewell lavinia my noble sister
 o would thou wert as thou tofore hast been
 but now nor lucius nor lavinia lives
 but in oblivion and hateful griefs
 if lucius live he will requite your wrongs
 and make proud saturnine and his empress
 beg at the gates like tarquin and his queen
 now will i to the goths and raise a power
 to be revenged on rome and saturnine
 exit
 titus andronicus
act iii
scene ii a room in titus's house a banquet set out
 enter titus marcus lavinia and young lucius a boy
titus andronicus so so now sit and look you eat no more
 than will preserve just so much strength in us
 as will revenge these bitter woes of ours
 marcus unknit that sorrowwreathen knot
 thy niece and i poor creatures want our hands
 and cannot passionate our tenfold grief
 with folded arms this poor right hand of mine
 is left to tyrannize upon my breast
 who when my heart all mad with misery
 beats in this hollow prison of my flesh
 then thus i thump it down
 to lavinia
 thou map of woe that thus dost talk in signs
 when thy poor heart beats with outrageous beating
 thou canst not strike it thus to make it still
 wound it with sighing girl kill it with groans
 or get some little knife between thy teeth
 and just against thy heart make thou a hole
 that all the tears that thy poor eyes let fall
 may run into that sink and soaking in
 drown the lamenting fool in seasalt tears
marcus andronicus fie brother fie teach her not thus to lay
 such violent hands upon her tender life
titus andronicus how now has sorrow made thee dote already
 why marcus no man should be mad but i
 what violent hands can she lay on her life
 ah wherefore dost thou urge the name of hands
 to bid aeneas tell the tale twice o'er
 how troy was burnt and he made miserable
 o handle not the theme to talk of hands
 lest we remember still that we have none
 fie fie how franticly i square my talk
 as if we should forget we had no hands
 if marcus did not name the word of hands
 come let's fall to and gentle girl eat this
 here is no drink hark marcus what she says
 i can interpret all her martyr'd signs
 she says she drinks no other drink but tears
 brew'd with her sorrow mesh'd upon her cheeks
 speechless complainer i will learn thy thought
 in thy dumb action will i be as perfect
 as begging hermits in their holy prayers
 thou shalt not sigh nor hold thy stumps to heaven
 nor wink nor nod nor kneel nor make a sign
 but i of these will wrest an alphabet
 and by still practise learn to know thy meaning
young lucius good grandsire leave these bitter deep laments
 make my aunt merry with some pleasing tale
marcus andronicus alas the tender boy in passion moved
 doth weep to see his grandsire's heaviness
titus andronicus peace tender sapling thou art made of tears
 and tears will quickly melt thy life away
 marcus strikes the dish with a knife
 what dost thou strike at marcus with thy knife
marcus andronicus at that that i have kill'd my lord a fly
titus andronicus out on thee murderer thou kill'st my heart
 mine eyes are cloy'd with view of tyranny
 a deed of death done on the innocent
 becomes not titus brother get thee gone
 i see thou art not for my company
marcus andronicus alas my lord i have but kill'd a fly
titus andronicus but how if that fly had a father and mother
 how would he hang his slender gilded wings
 and buzz lamenting doings in the air
 poor harmless fly
 that with his pretty buzzing melody
 came here to make us merry and thou hast
 kill'd him
marcus andronicus pardon me sir it was a black illfavor'd fly
 like to the empress moor therefore i kill'd him
titus andronicus o o o
 then pardon me for reprehending thee
 for thou hast done a charitable deed
 give me thy knife i will insult on him
 flattering myself as if it were the moor
 come hither purposely to poison me
 there's for thyself and that's for tamora
 ah sirrah
 yet i think we are not brought so low
 but that between us we can kill a fly
 that comes in likeness of a coalblack moor
marcus andronicus alas poor man grief has so wrought on him
 he takes false shadows for true substances
titus andronicus come take away lavinia go with me
 i'll to thy closet and go read with thee
 sad stories chanced in the times of old
 come boy and go with me thy sight is young
 and thou shalt read when mine begin to dazzle
 exeunt
 titus andronicus
