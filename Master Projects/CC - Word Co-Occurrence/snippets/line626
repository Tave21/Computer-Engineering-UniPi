 and his corruption being ta'en from us
 we as the spring of all shall pay for all
 therefore good cousin let not harry know
 in any case the offer of the king
vernon deliver what you will i'll say tis so
 here comes your cousin
 enter hotspur and douglas
hotspur my uncle is return'd
 deliver up my lord of westmoreland
 uncle what news
earl of worcester the king will bid you battle presently
earl of douglas defy him by the lord of westmoreland
hotspur lord douglas go you and tell him so
earl of douglas marry and shall and very willingly
 exit
earl of worcester there is no seeming mercy in the king
hotspur did you beg any god forbid
earl of worcester i told him gently of our grievances
 of his oathbreaking which he mended thus
 by now forswearing that he is forsworn
 he calls us rebels traitors and will scourge
 with haughty arms this hateful name in us
 reenter the earl of douglas
earl of douglas arm gentlemen to arms for i have thrown
 a brave defiance in king henry's teeth
 and westmoreland that was engaged did bear it
 which cannot choose but bring him quickly on
earl of worcester the prince of wales stepp'd forth before the king
 and nephew challenged you to single fight
hotspur o would the quarrel lay upon our heads
 and that no man might draw short breath today
 but i and harry monmouth tell me tell me
 how show'd his tasking seem'd it in contempt
vernon no by my soul i never in my life
 did hear a challenge urged more modestly
 unless a brother should a brother dare
 to gentle exercise and proof of arms
 he gave you all the duties of a man
 trimm'd up your praises with a princely tongue
 spoke to your deservings like a chronicle
 making you ever better than his praise
 by still dispraising praise valued in you
 and which became him like a prince indeed
 he made a blushing cital of himself
 and chid his truant youth with such a grace
 as if he master'd there a double spirit
 of teaching and of learning instantly
 there did he pause but let me tell the world
 if he outlive the envy of this day
 england did never owe so sweet a hope
 so much misconstrued in his wantonness
hotspur cousin i think thou art enamoured
 on his follies never did i hear
 of any prince so wild a libertine
 but be he as he will yet once ere night
 i will embrace him with a soldier's arm
 that he shall shrink under my courtesy
 arm arm with speed and fellows soldiers friends
 better consider what you have to do
 than i that have not well the gift of tongue
 can lift your blood up with persuasion
 enter a messenger
messenger my lord here are letters for you
hotspur i cannot read them now
 o gentlemen the time of life is short
 to spend that shortness basely were too long
 if life did ride upon a dial's point
 still ending at the arrival of an hour
 an if we live we live to tread on kings
 if die brave death when princes die with us
 now for our consciences the arms are fair
 when the intent of bearing them is just
 enter another messenger
messenger my lord prepare the king comes on apace
hotspur i thank him that he cuts me from my tale
 for i profess not talking only this
 let each man do his best and here draw i
 a sword whose temper i intend to stain
 with the best blood that i can meet withal
 in the adventure of this perilous day
 now esperance percy and set on
 sound all the lofty instruments of war
 and by that music let us all embrace
 for heaven to earth some of us never shall
 a second time do such a courtesy
 the trumpets sound they embrace and exeunt
