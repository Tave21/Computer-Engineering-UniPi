posthumus leonatus yea bloody cloth i'll keep thee for i wish'd

 if each of you should take this course how many
 must murder wives much better than themselves
 for wrying but a little o pisanio
 every good servant does not all commands
 no bond but to do just ones gods if you
 should have ta'en vengeance on my faults i never
 had lived to put on this so had you saved
 the noble imogen to repent and struck
 me wretch more worth your vengeance but alack
 you snatch some hence for little faults that's love
 to have them fall no more you some permit
 to second ills with ills each elder worse
 and make them dread it to the doers thrift
 but imogen is your own do your best wills
 and make me blest to obey i am brought hither
 among the italian gentry and to fight
 against my lady's kingdom tis enough
 that britain i have kill'd thy mistress peace
 i'll give no wound to thee therefore good heavens
 hear patiently my purpose i'll disrobe me
 of these italian weeds and suit myself
 as does a briton peasant so i'll fight
 against the part i come with so i'll die
 for thee o imogen even for whom my life
 is every breath a death and thus unknown
 pitied nor hated to the face of peril
 myself i'll dedicate let me make men know
 more valour in me than my habits show
 gods put the strength o the leonati in me
 to shame the guise o the world i will begin
 the fashion less without and more within

scene ii field of battle between the british and roman camps
 enter from one side lucius iachimo and
 the roman army from the other side the
 british army posthumus leonatus following
 like a poor soldier they march over and go
 out then enter again in skirmish iachimo
 and posthumus leonatus he vanquisheth and disarmeth
 iachimo and then leaves him
iachimo the heaviness and guilt within my bosom
 takes off my manhood i have belied a lady
 the princess of this country and the air on't
 revengingly enfeebles me or could this carl
 a very drudge of nature's have subdued me
 in my profession knighthoods and honours borne
 as i wear mine are titles but of scorn
 if that thy gentry britain go before
 this lout as he exceeds our lords the odds
 is that we scarce are men and you are gods

act v
scene iii another part of the field
 enter posthumus leonatus and a british lord
lord camest thou from where they made the stand
posthumus leonatus i did
 though you it seems come from the fliers
lord i did
posthumus leonatus no blame be to you sir for all was lost
 but that the heavens fought the king himself
 of his wings destitute the army broken
 and but the backs of britons seen all flying
 through a straight lane the enemy fullhearted
 lolling the tongue with slaughtering having work
 more plentiful than tools to do't struck down
 some mortally some slightly touch'd some falling
 merely through fear that the straight pass was damm'd
 with dead men hurt behind and cowards living
 to die with lengthen'd shame
lord where was this lane
posthumus leonatus close by the battle ditch'd and wall'd with turf
 which gave advantage to an ancient soldier
 an honest one i warrant who deserved
 so long a breeding as his white beard came to
 in doing this for's country athwart the lane
 he with two striplingslads more like to run
 the country base than to commit such slaughter
 with faces fit for masks or rather fairer
 than those for preservation cased or shame
 made good the passage cried to those that fled
 our britain s harts die flying not our men
 to darkness fleet souls that fly backwards stand
 or we are romans and will give you that
 like beasts which you shun beastly and may save
 but to look back in frown stand stand'
 these three
 three thousand confident in act as many
 for three performers are the file when all
 the rest do nothingwith this word stand stand'
 accommodated by the place more charming
 with their own nobleness which could have turn'd
 a distaff to a lance gilded pale looks
 part shame part spirit renew'd that some
 turn'd coward
 but by exampleo a sin in war
 damn'd in the first beginnersgan to look
 the way that they did and to grin like lions
 upon the pikes o the hunters then began
 a stop i the chaser a retire anon
 a rout confusion thick forthwith they fly
 chickens the way which they stoop'd eagles slaves
 the strides they victors made and now our cowards
 like fragments in hard voyages became
 the life o the need having found the backdoor open
 of the unguarded hearts heavens how they wound
 some slain before some dying some their friends
 o'er borne i the former wave ten chased by one
 are now each one the slaughterman of twenty
 those that would die or ere resist are grown
 the mortal bugs o the field
lord this was strange chance
 a narrow lane an old man and two boys
posthumus leonatus nay do not wonder at it you are made
 rather to wonder at the things you hear
 than to work any will you rhyme upon't
 and vent it for a mockery here is one
 two boys an old man twice a boy a lane
 preserved the britons was the romans bane'
lord nay be not angry sir
posthumus leonatus lack to what end
 who dares not stand his foe i'll be his friend
 for if he'll do as he is made to do
 i know he'll quickly fly my friendship too
 you have put me into rhyme
lord farewell you're angry
posthumus leonatus still going
 exit lord
 this is a lord o noble misery
 to be i the field and ask what news of me
 today how many would have given their honours
 to have saved their carcasses took heel to do't
 and yet died too i in mine own woe charm'd
 could not find death where i did hear him groan
 nor feel him where he struck being an ugly monster
 tis strange he hides him in fresh cups soft beds
 sweet words or hath more ministers than we
 that draw his knives i the war well i will find him
 for being now a favourer to the briton
 no more a briton i have resumed again
 the part i came in fight i will no more
 but yield me to the veriest hind that shall
 once touch my shoulder great the slaughter is
 here made by the roman great the answer be
 britons must take for me my ransom's death
 on either side i come to spend my breath
 which neither here i'll keep nor bear again
 but end it by some means for imogen
 enter two british captains and soldiers
first captain great jupiter be praised lucius is taken
 tis thought the old man and his sons were angels
second captain there was a fourth man in a silly habit
 that gave the affront with them
first captain so tis reported
 but none of em can be found stand who's there
posthumus leonatus a roman
 who had not now been drooping here if seconds
 had answer'd him
second captain lay hands on him a dog
 a leg of rome shall not return to tell
 what crows have peck'd them here he brags
 his service
 as if he were of note bring him to the king
 enter cymbeline belarius guiderius arviragus
