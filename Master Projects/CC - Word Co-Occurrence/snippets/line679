 enter salisbury
salisbury now by my sword well hast thou fought today
 by the mass so did we all i thank you richard
 god knows how long it is i have to live
 and it hath pleased him that three times today
 you have defended me from imminent death
 well lords we have not got that which we have
 tis not enough our foes are this time fled
 being opposites of such repairing nature
york i know our safety is to follow them
 for as i hear the king is fled to london
 to call a present court of parliament
 let us pursue him ere the writs go forth
 what says lord warwick shall we after them
warwick after them nay before them if we can
 now by my faith lords twas a glorious day
 saint alban's battle won by famous york
 shall be eternized in all age to come
 sound drums and trumpets and to london all
 and more such days as these to us befall

 alarum enter york edward richard norfolk
 montague warwick and soldiers
warwick i wonder how the king escaped our hands
york while we pursued the horsemen of the north
 he slily stole away and left his men
 whereat the great lord of northumberland
 whose warlike ears could never brook retreat
 cheer'd up the drooping army and himself
 lord clifford and lord stafford all abreast
 charged our main battle's front and breaking in
 were by the swords of common soldiers slain
edward lord stafford's father duke of buckingham
 is either slain or wounded dangerously
 i cleft his beaver with a downright blow
 that this is true father behold his blood
montague and brother here's the earl of wiltshire's blood
 whom i encounter'd as the battles join'd
richard speak thou for me and tell them what i did
 throwing down somerset's head
york richard hath best deserved of all my sons
 but is your grace dead my lord of somerset
norfolk such hope have all the line of john of gaunt
richard thus do i hope to shake king henry's head
warwick and so do i victorious prince of york
 before i see thee seated in that throne
 which now the house of lancaster usurps
 i vow by heaven these eyes shall never close
 this is the palace of the fearful king
 and this the regal seat possess it york
 for this is thine and not king henry's heirs'
york assist me then sweet warwick and i will
 for hither we have broken in by force
norfolk we'll all assist you he that flies shall die
york thanks gentle norfolk stay by me my lords
 and soldiers stay and lodge by me this night
 they go up
warwick and when the king comes offer no violence
 unless he seek to thrust you out perforce
york the queen this day here holds her parliament
 but little thinks we shall be of her council
 by words or blows here let us win our right
richard arm'd as we are let's stay within this house
warwick the bloody parliament shall this be call'd
 unless plantagenet duke of york be king
 and bashful henry deposed whose cowardice
 hath made us bywords to our enemies
york then leave me not my lords be resolute
 i mean to take possession of my right
warwick neither the king nor he that loves him best
 the proudest he that holds up lancaster
 dares stir a wing if warwick shake his bells
 i'll plant plantagenet root him up who dares
 resolve thee richard claim the english crown
 flourish enter king henry vi clifford
 northumberland westmoreland exeter and the rest
king henry vi my lords look where the sturdy rebel sits
 even in the chair of state belike he means
 back'd by the power of warwick that false peer
 to aspire unto the crown and reign as king
 earl of northumberland he slew thy father
 and thine lord clifford and you both have vow'd revenge
 on him his sons his favourites and his friends
northumberland if i be not heavens be revenged on me
clifford the hope thereof makes clifford mourn in steel
westmoreland what shall we suffer this let's pluck him down
 my heart for anger burns i cannot brook it
king henry vi be patient gentle earl of westmoreland
clifford patience is for poltroons such as he
 he durst not sit there had your father lived
 my gracious lord here in the parliament
 let us assail the family of york
northumberland well hast thou spoken cousin be it so
king henry vi ah know you not the city favours them
 and they have troops of soldiers at their beck
exeter but when the duke is slain they'll quickly fly
king henry vi far be the thought of this from henry's heart
 to make a shambles of the parliamenthouse
 cousin of exeter frowns words and threats
 shall be the war that henry means to use
 thou factious duke of york descend my throne
 and kneel for grace and mercy at my feet
 i am thy sovereign
york i am thine
exeter for shame come down he made thee duke of york
york twas my inheritance as the earldom was
exeter thy father was a traitor to the crown
warwick exeter thou art a traitor to the crown
 in following this usurping henry
clifford whom should he follow but his natural king
warwick true clifford and that's richard duke of york
king henry vi and shall i stand and thou sit in my throne
york it must and shall be so content thyself
warwick be duke of lancaster let him be king
westmoreland he is both king and duke of lancaster
 and that the lord of westmoreland shall maintain
warwick and warwick shall disprove it you forget
 that we are those which chased you from the field
 and slew your fathers and with colours spread
 march'd through the city to the palace gates
northumberland yes warwick i remember it to my grief
 and by his soul thou and thy house shall rue it
westmoreland plantagenet of thee and these thy sons
 thy kinsman and thy friends i'll have more lives
 than drops of blood were in my father's veins
clifford urge it no more lest that instead of words
 i send thee warwick such a messenger
 as shall revenge his death before i stir
