 i never did her hurt in all my life
 i never spake bad word nor did ill turn
 to any living creature believe me la
 i never kill'd a mouse nor hurt a fly
 i trod upon a worm against my will
 but i wept for it how have i offended
 wherein my death might yield her any profit
 or my life imply her any danger
leonine my commission
 is not to reason of the deed but do it
marina you will not do't for all the world i hope
 you are well favour'd and your looks foreshow
 you have a gentle heart i saw you lately
 when you caught hurt in parting two that fought
 good sooth it show'd well in you do so now
 your lady seeks my life come you between
 and save poor me the weaker
leonine i am sworn
 and will dispatch
 he seizes her
 enter pirates
first pirate hold villain
 leonine runs away
second pirate a prize a prize
third pirate halfpart mates halfpart
 come let's have her aboard suddenly
 exeunt pirates with marina
 reenter leonine
leonine these roguing thieves serve the great pirate valdes
 and they have seized marina let her go
 there's no hope she will return i'll swear
 she's dead
 and thrown into the sea but i'll see further
 perhaps they will but please themselves upon her
 not carry her aboard if she remain
 whom they have ravish'd must by me be slain

pandar search the market narrowly mytilene is full of
 gallants we lost too much money this mart by being
 too wenchless
bawd we were never so much out of creatures we have but
 poor three and they can do no more than they can
 do and they with continual action are even as good as rotten
pandar therefore let's have fresh ones whate'er we pay for
 them if there be not a conscience to be used in
 every trade we shall never prosper

 bastardsas i think i have brought up some eleven
boult ay to eleven and brought them down again but

pandar thou sayest true they're too unwholesome o'
 conscience the poor transylvanian is dead that
 lay with the little baggage
boult ay she quickly pooped him she made him roastmeat
 for worms but i'll go search the market
 exit
pandar three or four thousand chequins were as pretty a
 proportion to live quietly and so give over
bawd why to give over i pray you is it a shame to get
 when we are old
pandar o our credit comes not in like the commodity nor
 the commodity wages not with the danger therefore
 if in our youths we could pick up some pretty
 estate twere not amiss to keep our door hatched
 besides the sore terms we stand upon with the gods
 will be strong with us for giving over
bawd come other sorts offend as well as we
pandar as well as we ay and better too we offend worse
 neither is our profession any trade it's no
 calling but here comes boult

 hair complexion height age with warrant of her
 virginity and cry he that will give most shall
 have her first such a maidenhead were no cheap
 thing if men were as they have been get this done

 exit
marina alack that leonine was so slack so slow
 he should have struck not spoke or that these pirates
 not enough barbarous had not o'erboard thrown me
 for to seek my mother
bawd why lament you pretty one
marina that i am pretty
bawd come the gods have done their part in you
marina i accuse them not
bawd you are light into my hands where you are like to live

 fashions you shall fare well you shall have the
 difference of all complexions what do you stop your ears
marina are you a woman

bawd marry whip thee gosling i think i shall have
 something to do with you come you're a young
 foolish sapling and must be bowed as i would have
 you
marina the gods defend me
bawd if it please the gods to defend you by men then men
 must comfort you men must feed you men must stir
 you up boult's returned
 reenter boult
 now sir hast thou cried her through the market
boult i have cried her almost to the number of her hairs
 i have drawn her picture with my voice
bawd and i prithee tell me how dost thou find the
 inclination of the people especially of the younger sort
boult faith they listened to me as they would have
 hearkened to their father's testament there was a
 spaniard's mouth so watered that he went to bed to
 her very description
bawd we shall have him here tomorrow with his best ruff on
boult tonight tonight but mistress do you know the
 french knight that cowers i the hams
bawd who monsieur veroles
boult ay he he offered to cut a caper at the
 proclamation but he made a groan at it and swore
 he would see her tomorrow
bawd well well as for him he brought his disease
 hither here he does but repair it i know he will
 come in our shadow to scatter his crowns in the
 sun
boult well if we had of every nation a traveller we
 should lodge them with this sign
bawd to marina pray you come hither awhile you
 have fortunes coming upon you mark me you must
 seem to do that fearfully which you commit
 willingly despise profit where you have most gain
 to weep that you live as ye do makes pity in your
 lovers seldom but that pity begets you a good
 opinion and that opinion a mere profit
marina i understand you not
boult o take her home mistress take her home these
 blushes of hers must be quenched with some present practise
bawd thou sayest true i faith so they must for your
 bride goes to that with shame which is her way to go
 with warrant
boult faith some do and some do not but mistress if
 i have bargained for the joint
bawd thou mayst cut a morsel off the spit
boult i may so
bawd who should deny it come young one i like the
 manner of your garments well
boult ay by my faith they shall not be changed yet
bawd boult spend thou that in the town report what a
 sojourner we have you'll lose nothing by custom
 when nature flamed this piece she meant thee a good
 turn therefore say what a paragon she is and thou
 hast the harvest out of thine own report
boult i warrant you mistress thunder shall not so awake
 the beds of eels as my giving out her beauty stir up
 the lewdlyinclined i'll bring home some tonight
bawd come your ways follow me
marina if fires be hot knives sharp or waters deep
 untied i still my virgin knot will keep
 diana aid my purpose
bawd what have we to do with diana pray you will you go with us
