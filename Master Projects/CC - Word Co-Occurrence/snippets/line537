 exeunt
 the tempest
act i
scene ii the island before prospero's cell
 enter prospero and miranda
miranda if by your art my dearest father you have
 put the wild waters in this roar allay them
 the sky it seems would pour down stinking pitch
 but that the sea mounting to the welkin's cheek
 dashes the fire out o i have suffered
 with those that i saw suffer a brave vessel
 who had no doubt some noble creature in her
 dash'd all to pieces o the cry did knock
 against my very heart poor souls they perish'd
 had i been any god of power i would
 have sunk the sea within the earth or ere
 it should the good ship so have swallow'd and
 the fraughting souls within her
prospero be collected
 no more amazement tell your piteous heart
 there's no harm done
miranda o woe the day
prospero no harm
 i have done nothing but in care of thee
 of thee my dear one thee my daughter who
 art ignorant of what thou art nought knowing
 of whence i am nor that i am more better
 than prospero master of a full poor cell
 and thy no greater father
miranda more to know
 did never meddle with my thoughts
prospero tis time
 i should inform thee farther lend thy hand
 and pluck my magic garment from me so
 lays down his mantle
 lie there my art wipe thou thine eyes have comfort
 the direful spectacle of the wreck which touch'd
 the very virtue of compassion in thee
 i have with such provision in mine art
 so safely ordered that there is no soul
 no not so much perdition as an hair
 betid to any creature in the vessel
 which thou heard'st cry which thou saw'st sink sit down
 for thou must now know farther
miranda you have often
 begun to tell me what i am but stopp'd
 and left me to a bootless inquisition
 concluding stay not yet'
prospero the hour's now come
 the very minute bids thee ope thine ear
 obey and be attentive canst thou remember
 a time before we came unto this cell
 i do not think thou canst for then thou wast not
 out three years old
miranda certainly sir i can
prospero by what by any other house or person
 of any thing the image tell me that
 hath kept with thy remembrance
miranda tis far off
 and rather like a dream than an assurance
 that my remembrance warrants had i not
 four or five women once that tended me
prospero thou hadst and more miranda but how is it
 that this lives in thy mind what seest thou else
 in the dark backward and abysm of time
 if thou remember'st aught ere thou camest here
 how thou camest here thou mayst
miranda but that i do not
prospero twelve year since miranda twelve year since
 thy father was the duke of milan and
 a prince of power
miranda sir are not you my father
prospero thy mother was a piece of virtue and
 she said thou wast my daughter and thy father
 was duke of milan and thou his only heir
 and princess no worse issued
miranda o the heavens
 what foul play had we that we came from thence
 or blessed was't we did
prospero both both my girl
 by foul play as thou say'st were we heaved thence
 but blessedly holp hither
miranda o my heart bleeds
 to think o the teen that i have turn'd you to
 which is from my remembrance please you farther
prospero my brother and thy uncle call'd antonio
 i pray thee mark methat a brother should
 be so perfidioushe whom next thyself
 of all the world i loved and to him put
 the manage of my state as at that time
 through all the signories it was the first
 and prospero the prime duke being so reputed
 in dignity and for the liberal arts
 without a parallel those being all my study
 the government i cast upon my brother
 and to my state grew stranger being transported
 and rapt in secret studies thy false uncle
 dost thou attend me
miranda sir most heedfully
prospero being once perfected how to grant suits
 how to deny them who to advance and who
 to trash for overtopping new created
 the creatures that were mine i say or changed em
 or else new form'd em having both the key
 of officer and office set all hearts i the state
 to what tune pleased his ear that now he was
 the ivy which had hid my princely trunk
 and suck'd my verdure out on't thou attend'st not
miranda o good sir i do
prospero i pray thee mark me
 i thus neglecting worldly ends all dedicated
 to closeness and the bettering of my mind
 with that which but by being so retired
 o'erprized all popular rate in my false brother
 awaked an evil nature and my trust
 like a good parent did beget of him
 a falsehood in its contrary as great
 as my trust was which had indeed no limit
 a confidence sans bound he being thus lorded
 not only with what my revenue yielded
 but what my power might else exact like one
 who having into truth by telling of it
 made such a sinner of his memory
 to credit his own lie he did believe
 he was indeed the duke out o the substitution
 and executing the outward face of royalty
 with all prerogative hence his ambition growing
 dost thou hear
miranda your tale sir would cure deafness
prospero to have no screen between this part he play'd
 and him he play'd it for he needs will be
 absolute milan me poor man my library
 was dukedom large enough of temporal royalties
 he thinks me now incapable confederates
 so dry he was for swaywi the king of naples
 to give him annual tribute do him homage
 subject his coronet to his crown and bend
 the dukedom yet unbow'dalas poor milan
 to most ignoble stooping
miranda o the heavens
prospero mark his condition and the event then tell me
 if this might be a brother
miranda i should sin
 to think but nobly of my grandmother
 good wombs have borne bad sons
prospero now the condition
 the king of naples being an enemy
 to me inveterate hearkens my brother's suit
 which was that he in lieu o the premises
