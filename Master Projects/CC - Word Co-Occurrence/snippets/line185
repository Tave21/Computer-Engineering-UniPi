 upon's again
cominius they are worn lord consul so
 that we shall hardly in our ages see
 their banners wave again
coriolanus saw you aufidius
lartius on safeguard he came to me and did curse
 against the volsces for they had so vilely
 yielded the town he is retired to antium
coriolanus spoke he of me
lartius he did my lord
coriolanus how what
lartius how often he had met you sword to sword
 that of all things upon the earth he hated
 your person most that he would pawn his fortunes
 to hopeless restitution so he might
 be call'd your vanquisher
coriolanus at antium lives he
lartius at antium
coriolanus i wish i had a cause to seek him there
 to oppose his hatred fully welcome home
 enter sicinius and brutus
 behold these are the tribunes of the people
 the tongues o the common mouth i do despise them
 for they do prank them in authority
 against all noble sufferance
sicinius pass no further
coriolanus ha what is that
brutus it will be dangerous to go on no further
coriolanus what makes this change
menenius the matter
cominius hath he not pass'd the noble and the common
brutus cominius no
coriolanus have i had children's voices
first senator tribunes give way he shall to the marketplace
brutus the people are incensed against him
sicinius stop
 or all will fall in broil
coriolanus are these your herd
 must these have voices that can yield them now
 and straight disclaim their tongues what are
 your offices
 you being their mouths why rule you not their teeth
 have you not set them on
menenius be calm be calm
coriolanus it is a purposed thing and grows by plot
 to curb the will of the nobility
 suffer't and live with such as cannot rule
 nor ever will be ruled
brutus call't not a plot
 the people cry you mock'd them and of late
 when corn was given them gratis you repined
 scandal'd the suppliants for the people call'd them
 timepleasers flatterers foes to nobleness
coriolanus why this was known before
brutus not to them all
coriolanus have you inform'd them sithence
brutus how i inform them
coriolanus you are like to do such business
brutus not unlike
 each way to better yours
coriolanus why then should i be consul by yond clouds
 let me deserve so ill as you and make me
 your fellow tribune
sicinius you show too much of that
 for which the people stir if you will pass
 to where you are bound you must inquire your way
 which you are out of with a gentler spirit
 or never be so noble as a consul
 nor yoke with him for tribune
menenius let's be calm
cominius the people are abused set on this paltering
 becomes not rome nor has coriolanus
 deserved this so dishonour'd rub laid falsely
 i the plain way of his merit
coriolanus tell me of corn
 this was my speech and i will speak't again
menenius not now not now
first senator not in this heat sir now
coriolanus now as i live i will my nobler friends
 i crave their pardons
 for the mutable rankscented many let them
 regard me as i do not flatter and
 therein behold themselves i say again
 in soothing them we nourish gainst our senate
 the cockle of rebellion insolence sedition
 which we ourselves have plough'd for sow'd
 and scatter'd
 by mingling them with us the honour'd number
 who lack not virtue no nor power but that
 which they have given to beggars
menenius well no more
first senator no more words we beseech you
coriolanus how no more
 as for my country i have shed my blood
 not fearing outward force so shall my lungs
 coin words till their decay against those measles
 which we disdain should tatter us yet sought
 the very way to catch them
brutus you speak o the people
 as if you were a god to punish not
 a man of their infirmity
sicinius twere well
 we let the people know't
menenius what what his choler
coriolanus choler
 were i as patient as the midnight sleep
 by jove twould be my mind
sicinius it is a mind
 that shall remain a poison where it is
 not poison any further
coriolanus shall remain
 hear you this triton of the minnows mark you
 his absolute shall'
cominius twas from the canon
coriolanus shall'
 o good but most unwise patricians why
 you grave but reckless senators have you thus
 given hydra here to choose an officer
 that with his peremptory shall being but
 the horn and noise o the monster's wants not spirit
 to say he'll turn your current in a ditch
 and make your channel his if he have power
 then vail your ignorance if none awake
 your dangerous lenity if you are learn'd
 be not as common fools if you are not
 let them have cushions by you you are plebeians
 if they be senators and they are no less
 when both your voices blended the great'st taste
 most palates theirs they choose their magistrate
 and such a one as he who puts his shall'
 his popular shall against a graver bench
 than ever frown in greece by jove himself
 it makes the consuls base and my soul aches
 to know when two authorities are up
 neither supreme how soon confusion
 may enter twixt the gap of both and take
 the one by the other
cominius well on to the marketplace
coriolanus whoever gave that counsel to give forth
 the corn o the storehouse gratis as twas used
 sometime in greece
menenius well well no more of that
coriolanus though there the people had more absolute power
 i say they nourish'd disobedience fed
 the ruin of the state
brutus why shall the people give
 one that speaks thus their voice
coriolanus i'll give my reasons
 more worthier than their voices they know the corn
 was not our recompense resting well assured
 that ne'er did service for't being press'd to the war
 even when the navel of the state was touch'd
 they would not thread the gates this kind of service
 did not deserve corn gratis being i the war
 their mutinies and revolts wherein they show'd
 most valour spoke not for them the accusation
 which they have often made against the senate
 all cause unborn could never be the motive
 of our so frank donation well what then
 how shall this bisson multitude digest
 the senate's courtesy let deeds express
 what's like to be their words we did request it
 we are the greater poll and in true fear
 they gave us our demands thus we debase
 the nature of our seats and make the rabble
 call our cares fears which will in time
 break ope the locks o the senate and bring in
 the crows to peck the eagles
menenius come enough
brutus enough with overmeasure
coriolanus no take more
 what may be sworn by both divine and human
 seal what i end withal this double worship
 where one part does disdain with cause the other
 insult without all reason where gentry title wisdom
 cannot conclude but by the yea and no
 of general ignoranceit must omit
 real necessities and give way the while
 to unstable slightness purpose so barr'd
 it follows
 nothing is done to purpose therefore beseech you
 you that will be less fearful than discreet
 that love the fundamental part of state
 more than you doubt the change on't that prefer
 a noble life before a long and wish
 to jump a body with a dangerous physic
 that's sure of death without it at once pluck out
 the multitudinous tongue let them not lick
 the sweet which is their poison your dishonour
 mangles true judgment and bereaves the state
 of that integrity which should become't
 not having the power to do the good it would
 for the in which doth control't
brutus has said enough
sicinius has spoken like a traitor and shall answer
 as traitors do
coriolanus thou wretch despite o'erwhelm thee
 what should the people do with these bald tribunes
 on whom depending their obedience fails
 to the greater bench in a rebellion
