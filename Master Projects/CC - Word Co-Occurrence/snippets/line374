 enter helena widow and diana
helena that you may well perceive i have not wrong'd you
 one of the greatest in the christian world

 ere i can perfect mine intents to kneel

 dear almost as his life which gratitude
 through flinty tartar's bosom would peep forth
 and answer thanks i duly am inform'd
 his grace is at marseilles to which place
 we have convenient convoy you must know
 i am supposed dead the army breaking
 my husband hies him home where heaven aiding
 and by the leave of my good lord the king
 we'll be before our welcome
widow gentle madam
 you never had a servant to whose trust
 your business was more welcome
helena nor you mistress
 ever a friend whose thoughts more truly labour
 to recompense your love doubt not but heaven
 hath brought me up to be your daughter's dower
 as it hath fated her to be my motive
 and helper to a husband but o strange men
 that can such sweet use make of what they hate
 when saucy trusting of the cozen'd thoughts
 defiles the pitchy night so lust doth play
 with what it loathes for that which is away
 but more of this hereafter you diana
 under my poor instructions yet must suffer
 something in my behalf
diana let death and honesty
 go with your impositions i am yours
 upon your will to suffer
helena yet i pray you
 but with the word the time will bring on summer
 when briers shall have leaves as well as thorns
 and be as sweet as sharp we must away
 our wagon is prepared and time revives us
 all's well that ends well still the fine's the crown
 whate'er the course the end is the renown

act iv
scene v rousillon the count's palace

lafeu no no no your son was misled with a snipttaffeta
 fellow there whose villanous saffron would have
 made all the unbaked and doughy youth of a nation in
 his colour your daughterinlaw had been alive at
 this hour and your son here at home more advanced
 by the king than by that redtailed humblebee i speak of
countess i would i had not known him it was the death of the
 most virtuous gentlewoman that ever nature had
 praise for creating if she had partaken of my
 flesh and cost me the dearest groans of a mother i
 could not have owed her a more rooted love
lafeu twas a good lady twas a good lady we may pick a
 thousand salads ere we light on such another herb
clown indeed sir she was the sweet marjoram of the
 salad or rather the herb of grace
lafeu they are not herbs you knave they are noseherbs
clown i am no great nebuchadnezzar sir i have not much
 skill in grass
lafeu whether dost thou profess thyself a knave or a fool
clown a fool sir at a woman's service and a knave at a man's
lafeu your distinction
clown i would cozen the man of his wife and do his service
lafeu so you were a knave at his service indeed
clown and i would give his wife my bauble sir to do her service
lafeu i will subscribe for thee thou art both knave and fool
clown at your service
lafeu no no no
clown why sir if i cannot serve you i can serve as
 great a prince as you are
lafeu who's that a frenchman
clown faith sir a has an english name but his fisnomy
 is more hotter in france than there
lafeu what prince is that
clown the black prince sir alias the prince of
 darkness alias the devil
lafeu hold thee there's my purse i give thee not this
 to suggest thee from thy master thou talkest of
 serve him still
clown i am a woodland fellow sir that always loved a
 great fire and the master i speak of ever keeps a
 good fire but sure he is the prince of the
 world let his nobility remain in's court i am for
 the house with the narrow gate which i take to be
 too little for pomp to enter some that humble
 themselves may but the many will be too chill and
 tender and they'll be for the flowery way that
 leads to the broad gate and the great fire
lafeu go thy ways i begin to be aweary of thee and i
 tell thee so before because i would not fall out
 with thee go thy ways let my horses be well
 looked to without any tricks
clown if i put any tricks upon em sir they shall be
 jades tricks which are their own right by the law of nature
 exit
lafeu a shrewd knave and an unhappy
countess so he is my lord that's gone made himself much
 sport out of him by his authority he remains here
 which he thinks is a patent for his sauciness and
 indeed he has no pace but runs where he will
lafeu i like him well tis not amiss and i was about to
 tell you since i heard of the good lady's death and
 that my lord your son was upon his return home i
 moved the king my master to speak in the behalf of
 my daughter which in the minority of them both
 his majesty out of a selfgracious remembrance did
 first propose his highness hath promised me to do
 it and to stop up the displeasure he hath
 conceived against your son there is no fitter
 matter how does your ladyship like it
countess with very much content my lord and i wish it
 happily effected
lafeu his highness comes post from marseilles of as able
 body as when he numbered thirty he will be here
 tomorrow or i am deceived by him that in such
 intelligence hath seldom failed
countess it rejoices me that i hope i shall see him ere i
 die i have letters that my son will be here
 tonight i shall beseech your lordship to remain
 with me till they meet together
lafeu madam i was thinking with what manners i might
 safely be admitted
countess you need but plead your honourable privilege
lafeu lady of that i have made a bold charter but i
 thank my god it holds yet
 reenter clown
clown o madam yonder's my lord your son with a patch of
 velvet on's face whether there be a scar under't
 or no the velvet knows but tis a goodly patch of
 velvet his left cheek is a cheek of two pile and a
 half but his right cheek is worn bare
lafeu a scar nobly got or a noble scar is a good livery
 of honour so belike is that
clown but it is your carbonadoed face
lafeu let us go see your son i pray you i long to talk
 with the young noble soldier
clown faith there's a dozen of em with delicate fine
 hats and most courteous feathers which bow the head
 and nod at every man
