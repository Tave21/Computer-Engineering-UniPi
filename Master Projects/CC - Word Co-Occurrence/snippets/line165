 praying for both parts
 the good gods me presently
 when i shall pray o bless my lord and husband'
 undo that prayer by crying out as loud
 o bless my brother husband win win brother
 prays and destroys the prayer no midway
 twixt these extremes at all
mark antony gentle octavia
 let your best love draw to that point which seeks
 best to preserve it if i lose mine honour
 i lose myself better i were not yours
 than yours so branchless but as you requested
 yourself shall go between s the mean time lady
 i'll raise the preparation of a war
 shall stain your brother make your soonest haste
 so your desires are yours
octavia thanks to my lord
 the jove of power make me most weak most weak
 your reconciler wars twixt you twain would be
 as if the world should cleave and that slain men
 should solder up the rift
mark antony when it appears to you where this begins
 turn your displeasure that way for our faults
 can never be so equal that your love
 can equally move with them provide your going
 choose your own company and command what cost
 your heart has mind to

scene vi rome octavius caesar's house
 enter octavius caesar agrippa and mecaenas
octavius caesar contemning rome he has done all this and more
 in alexandria here's the manner of t
 i the marketplace on a tribunal silver'd
 cleopatra and himself in chairs of gold
 were publicly enthroned at the feet sat
 caesarion whom they call my father's son
 and all the unlawful issue that their lust
 since then hath made between them unto her
 he gave the stablishment of egypt made her
 of lower syria cyprus lydia
 absolute queen
mecaenas this in the public eye
octavius caesar i the common showplace where they exercise
 his sons he there proclaim'd the kings of kings
 great media parthia and armenia
 he gave to alexander to ptolemy he assign'd
 syria cilicia and phoenicia she
 in the habiliments of the goddess isis
 that day appear'd and oft before gave audience
 as tis reported so
mecaenas let rome be thus inform'd
agrippa who queasy with his insolence
 already will their good thoughts call from him
octavius caesar the people know it and have now received
 his accusations
agrippa who does he accuse
octavius caesar caesar and that having in sicily
 sextus pompeius spoil'd we had not rated him
 his part o the isle then does he say he lent me
 some shipping unrestored lastly he frets
 that lepidus of the triumvirate
 should be deposed and being that we detain
 all his revenue
agrippa sir this should be answer'd
octavius caesar tis done already and the messenger gone
 i have told him lepidus was grown too cruel
 that he his high authority abused
 and did deserve his change for what i have conquer'd
 i grant him part but then in his armenia
 and other of his conquer'd kingdoms i
 demand the like
mecaenas he'll never yield to that
octavius caesar nor must not then be yielded to in this
 enter octavia with her train
octavia hail caesar and my lord hail most dear caesar
octavius caesar that ever i should call thee castaway
octavia you have not call'd me so nor have you cause
octavius caesar why have you stol'n upon us thus you come not
 like caesar's sister the wife of antony
 should have an army for an usher and
 the neighs of horse to tell of her approach
 long ere she did appear the trees by the way
 should have borne men and expectation fainted
 longing for what it had not nay the dust
 should have ascended to the roof of heaven
 raised by your populous troops but you are come
 a marketmaid to rome and have prevented
 the ostentation of our love which left unshown
 is often left unloved we should have met you
 by sea and land supplying every stage
 with an augmented greeting
octavia good my lord
 to come thus was i not constrain'd but did
 on my free will my lord mark antony
 hearing that you prepared for war acquainted
 my grieved ear withal whereon i begg'd
 his pardon for return
octavius caesar which soon he granted
 being an obstruct tween his lust and him
octavia do not say so my lord
octavius caesar i have eyes upon him
 and his affairs come to me on the wind
 where is he now
octavia my lord in athens
octavius caesar no my most wronged sister cleopatra
 hath nodded him to her he hath given his empire
 up to a whore who now are levying
 the kings o the earth for war he hath assembled
 bocchus the king of libya archelaus
 of cappadocia philadelphos king
 of paphlagonia the thracian king adallas
 king malchus of arabia king of pont
 herod of jewry mithridates king
 of comagene polemon and amyntas
 the kings of mede and lycaonia
 with a more larger list of sceptres
octavia ay me most wretched
 that have my heart parted betwixt two friends
 that do afflict each other
octavius caesar welcome hither
 your letters did withhold our breaking forth
 till we perceived both how you were wrong led
 and we in negligent danger cheer your heart
 be you not troubled with the time which drives
 o'er your content these strong necessities
 but let determined things to destiny
 hold unbewail'd their way welcome to rome
 nothing more dear to me you are abused
 beyond the mark of thought and the high gods
 to do you justice make them ministers
 of us and those that love you best of comfort
 and ever welcome to us
agrippa welcome lady
mecaenas welcome dear madam
 each heart in rome does love and pity you
 only the adulterous antony most large
 in his abominations turns you off
 and gives his potent regiment to a trull
 that noises it against us
octavia is it so sir
octavius caesar most certain sister welcome pray you
 be ever known to patience my dear'st sister

cleopatra i will be even with thee doubt it not
domitius enobarbus but why why why
cleopatra thou hast forspoke my being in these wars
 and say'st it is not fit
domitius enobarbus well is it is it
cleopatra if not denounced against us why should not we
 be there in person
domitius enobarbus aside well i could reply
 if we should serve with horse and mares together
 the horse were merely lost the mares would bear
 a soldier and his horse
cleopatra what is't you say
domitius enobarbus your presence needs must puzzle antony
 take from his heart take from his brain
 from's time
 what should not then be spared he is already
 traduced for levity and tis said in rome
 that photinus an eunuch and your maids
 manage this war
cleopatra sink rome and their tongues rot
 that speak against us a charge we bear i the war
