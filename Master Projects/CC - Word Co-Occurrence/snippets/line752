 were i but now the lord of such hot youth
 as when brave gaunt thy father and myself
 rescued the black prince that young mars of men
 from forth the ranks of many thousand french
 o then how quickly should this arm of mine
 now prisoner to the palsy chastise thee
 and minister correction to thy fault
henry bolingbroke my gracious uncle let me know my fault
 on what condition stands it and wherein
duke of york even in condition of the worst degree
 in gross rebellion and detested treason
 thou art a banish'd man and here art come
 before the expiration of thy time
 in braving arms against thy sovereign
henry bolingbroke as i was banish'd i was banish'd hereford
 but as i come i come for lancaster
 and noble uncle i beseech your grace
 look on my wrongs with an indifferent eye
 you are my father for methinks in you
 i see old gaunt alive o then my father
 will you permit that i shall stand condemn'd
 a wandering vagabond my rights and royalties
 pluck'd from my arms perforce and given away
 to upstart unthrifts wherefore was i born
 if that my cousin king be king of england
 it must be granted i am duke of lancaster
 you have a son aumerle my noble cousin
 had you first died and he been thus trod down
 he should have found his uncle gaunt a father
 to rouse his wrongs and chase them to the bay
 i am denied to sue my livery here
 and yet my letterspatents give me leave
 my father's goods are all distrain'd and sold
 and these and all are all amiss employ'd
 what would you have me do i am a subject
 and i challenge law attorneys are denied me
 and therefore personally i lay my claim
 to my inheritance of free descent
northumberland the noble duke hath been too much abused
lord ross it stands your grace upon to do him right
lord willoughby base men by his endowments are made great
duke of york my lords of england let me tell you this
 i have had feeling of my cousin's wrongs
 and laboured all i could to do him right
 but in this kind to come in braving arms
 be his own carver and cut out his way
 to find out right with wrong it may not be
 and you that do abet him in this kind
 cherish rebellion and are rebels all
northumberland the noble duke hath sworn his coming is
 but for his own and for the right of that
 we all have strongly sworn to give him aid
 and let him ne'er see joy that breaks that oath
duke of york well well i see the issue of these arms
 i cannot mend it i must needs confess
 because my power is weak and all ill left
 but if i could by him that gave me life
 i would attach you all and make you stoop
 unto the sovereign mercy of the king
 but since i cannot be it known to you
 i do remain as neuter so fare you well
 unless you please to enter in the castle
 and there repose you for this night
henry bolingbroke an offer uncle that we will accept
 but we must win your grace to go with us
 to bristol castle which they say is held
 by bushy bagot and their complices
 the caterpillars of the commonwealth
 which i have sworn to weed and pluck away
duke of york it may be i will go with you but yet i'll pause
 for i am loath to break our country's laws
 nor friends nor foes to me welcome you are
 things past redress are now with me past care

act ii
scene iv a camp in wales
 enter earl of salisbury and a welsh captain
captain my lord of salisbury we have stay'd ten days
 and hardly kept our countrymen together
 and yet we hear no tidings from the king
 therefore we will disperse ourselves farewell
earl of salisbury stay yet another day thou trusty welshman
 the king reposeth all his confidence in thee
captain tis thought the king is dead we will not stay
 the baytrees in our country are all wither'd
 and meteors fright the fixed stars of heaven
 the palefaced moon looks bloody on the earth
 and leanlook'd prophets whisper fearful change
 rich men look sad and ruffians dance and leap
 the one in fear to lose what they enjoy
 the other to enjoy by rage and war
 these signs forerun the death or fall of kings
 farewell our countrymen are gone and fled
 as well assured richard their king is dead
 exit
earl of salisbury ah richard with the eyes of heavy mind
 i see thy glory like a shooting star
 fall to the base earth from the firmament
 thy sun sets weeping in the lowly west
 witnessing storms to come woe and unrest
 thy friends are fled to wait upon thy foes
 and crossly to thy good all fortune goes
 exit

act iii
scene i bristol before the castle
 enter henry bolingbroke duke of york
 northumberland lord ross henry percy lord
 willoughby with bushy and green prisoners
henry bolingbroke bring forth these men
 bushy and green i will not vex your souls
 since presently your souls must part your bodies
 with too much urging your pernicious lives
 for twere no charity yet to wash your blood
 from off my hands here in the view of men
 i will unfold some causes of your deaths
 you have misled a prince a royal king
 a happy gentleman in blood and lineaments
 by you unhappied and disfigured clean
 you have in manner with your sinful hours
 made a divorce betwixt his queen and him
 broke the possession of a royal bed
 and stain'd the beauty of a fair queen's cheeks
 with tears drawn from her eyes by your foul wrongs
 myself a prince by fortune of my birth
 near to the king in blood and near in love
 till you did make him misinterpret me
 have stoop'd my neck under your injuries
 and sigh'd my english breath in foreign clouds
 eating the bitter bread of banishment
 whilst you have fed upon my signories
 dispark'd my parks and fell'd my forest woods
 from my own windows torn my household coat
 razed out my imprese leaving me no sign
 save men's opinions and my living blood
 to show the world i am a gentleman
 this and much more much more than twice all this
 condemns you to the death see them deliver'd over
 to execution and the hand of death
bushy more welcome is the stroke of death to me
 than bolingbroke to england lords farewell
green my comfort is that heaven will take our souls
 and plague injustice with the pains of hell
henry bolingbroke my lord northumberland see them dispatch'd
 exeunt northumberland and others with the
 prisoners
 uncle you say the queen is at your house
 for god's sake fairly let her be entreated
 tell her i send to her my kind commends
 take special care my greetings be deliver'd
duke of york a gentleman of mine i have dispatch'd
 with letters of your love to her at large
henry bolingbroke thank gentle uncle come lords away
 to fight with glendower and his complices
 awhile to work and after holiday

 king richard ii
act iii
scene ii the coast of wales a castle in view
 drums flourish and colours enter king richard
 ii the bishop of carlisle duke of aumerle and soldiers
king richard ii barkloughly castle call they this at hand
duke of aumerle yea my lord how brooks your grace the air
 after your late tossing on the breaking seas
king richard ii needs must i like it well i weep for joy
 to stand upon my kingdom once again
 dear earth i do salute thee with my hand
 though rebels wound thee with their horses hoofs
 as a longparted mother with her child
 plays fondly with her tears and smiles in meeting
 so weeping smiling greet i thee my earth
 and do thee favours with my royal hands
 feed not thy sovereign's foe my gentle earth
 nor with thy sweets comfort his ravenous sense
 but let thy spiders that suck up thy venom
 and heavygaited toads lie in their way
 doing annoyance to the treacherous feet
 which with usurping steps do trample thee
 yield stinging nettles to mine enemies
 and when they from thy bosom pluck a flower
 guard it i pray thee with a lurking adder
 whose double tongue may with a mortal touch
 throw death upon thy sovereign's enemies
 mock not my senseless conjuration lords
 this earth shall have a feeling and these stones
 prove armed soldiers ere her native king
 shall falter under foul rebellion's arms
bishop of carlisle fear not my lord that power that made you king
 hath power to keep you king in spite of all
 the means that heaven yields must be embraced
 and not neglected else if heaven would
 and we will not heaven's offer we refuse
 the proffer'd means of succor and redress
duke of aumerle he means my lord that we are too remiss
 whilst bolingbroke through our security
 grows strong and great in substance and in power
king richard ii discomfortable cousin know'st thou not
 that when the searching eye of heaven is hid
 behind the globe that lights the lower world
