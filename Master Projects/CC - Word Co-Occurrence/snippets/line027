for these nations which thou shalt possess hearkened unto observers of times and unto diviners but as for thee the lord thy god hath not suffered thee so to do
the lord thy god will raise up unto thee a prophet from the midst of thee of thy brethren like unto me unto him ye shall hearken
according to all that thou desiredst of the lord thy god in horeb in the day of the assembly saying let me not hear again the voice of the lord my god neither let me see this great fire any more that i die not
and the lord said unto me they have well spoken that which they have spoken
i will raise them up a prophet from among their brethren like unto thee and will put my words in his mouth and he shall speak unto them all that i shall command him
and it shall come to pass that whosoever will not hearken unto my words which he shall speak in my name i will require it of him
but the prophet which shall presume to speak a word in my name which i have not commanded him to speak or that shall speak in the name of other gods even that prophet shall die
and if thou say in thine heart how shall we know the word which the lord hath not spoken
when a prophet speaketh in the name of the lord if the thing follow not nor come to pass that is the thing which the lord hath not spoken but the prophet hath spoken it presumptuously thou shalt not be afraid of him
when the lord thy god hath cut off the nations whose land the lord thy god giveth thee and thou succeedest them and dwellest in their cities and in their houses
thou shalt separate three cities for thee in the midst of thy land which the lord thy god giveth thee to possess it
thou shalt prepare thee a way and divide the coasts of thy land which the lord thy god giveth thee to inherit into three parts that every slayer may flee thither
and this is the case of the slayer which shall flee thither that he may live whoso killeth his neighbour ignorantly whom he hated not in time past
as when a man goeth into the wood with his neighbour to hew wood and his hand fetcheth a stroke with the axe to cut down the tree and the head slippeth from the helve and lighteth upon his neighbour that he die he shall flee unto one of those cities and live
lest the avenger of the blood pursue the slayer while his heart is hot and overtake him because the way is long and slay him whereas he was not worthy of death inasmuch as he hated him not in time past
wherefore i command thee saying thou shalt separate three cities for thee
and if the lord thy god enlarge thy coast as he hath sworn unto thy fathers and give thee all the land which he promised to give unto thy fathers
if thou shalt keep all these commandments to do them which i command thee this day to love the lord thy god and to walk ever in his ways then shalt thou add three cities more for thee beside these three
that innocent blood be not shed in thy land which the lord thy god giveth thee for an inheritance and so blood be upon thee
but if any man hate his neighbour and lie in wait for him and rise up against him and smite him mortally that he die and fleeth into one of these cities
then the elders of his city shall send and fetch him thence and deliver him into the hand of the avenger of blood that he may die
thine eye shall not pity him but thou shalt put away the guilt of innocent blood from israel that it may go well with thee
thou shalt not remove thy neighbour's landmark which they of old time have set in thine inheritance which thou shalt inherit in the land that the lord thy god giveth thee to possess it
one witness shall not rise up against a man for any iniquity or for any sin in any sin that he sinneth at the mouth of two witnesses or at the mouth of three witnesses shall the matter be established
if a false witness rise up against any man to testify against him that which is wrong
then both the men between whom the controversy is shall stand before the lord before the priests and the judges which shall be in those days
and the judges shall make diligent inquisition and behold if the witness be a false witness and hath testified falsely against his brother
then shall ye do unto him as he had thought to have done unto his brother so shalt thou put the evil away from among you
and those which remain shall hear and fear and shall henceforth commit no more any such evil among you
and thine eye shall not pity but life shall go for life eye for eye tooth for tooth hand for hand foot for foot
when thou goest out to battle against thine enemies and seest horses and chariots and a people more than thou be not afraid of them for the lord thy god is with thee which brought thee up out of the land of egypt
and it shall be when ye are come nigh unto the battle that the priest shall approach and speak unto the people
and shall say unto them hear o israel ye approach this day unto battle against your enemies let not your hearts faint fear not and do not tremble neither be ye terrified because of them
for the lord your god is he that goeth with you to fight for you against your enemies to save you
and the officers shall speak unto the people saying what man is there that hath built a new house and hath not dedicated it let him go and return to his house lest he die in the battle and another man dedicate it
and what man is he that hath planted a vineyard and hath not yet eaten of it let him also go and return unto his house lest he die in the battle and another man eat of it
and what man is there that hath betrothed a wife and hath not taken her let him go and return unto his house lest he die in the battle and another man take her
and the officers shall speak further unto the people and they shall say what man is there that is fearful and fainthearted let him go and return unto his house lest his brethren's heart faint as well as his heart
and it shall be when the officers have made an end of speaking unto the people that they shall make captains of the armies to lead the people
when thou comest nigh unto a city to fight against it then proclaim peace unto it
and it shall be if it make thee answer of peace and open unto thee then it shall be that all the people that is found therein shall be tributaries unto thee and they shall serve thee
and if it will make no peace with thee but will make war against thee then thou shalt besiege it
and when the lord thy god hath delivered it into thine hands thou shalt smite every male thereof with the edge of the sword
but the women and the little ones and the cattle and all that is in the city even all the spoil thereof shalt thou take unto thyself and thou shalt eat the spoil of thine enemies which the lord thy god hath given thee
thus shalt thou do unto all the cities which are very far off from thee which are not of the cities of these nations
but of the cities of these people which the lord thy god doth give thee for an inheritance thou shalt save alive nothing that breatheth
but thou shalt utterly destroy them namely the hittites and the amorites the canaanites and the perizzites the hivites and the jebusites as the lord thy god hath commanded thee
that they teach you not to do after all their abominations which they have done unto their gods so should ye sin against the lord your god
when thou shalt besiege a city a long time in making war against it to take it thou shalt not destroy the trees thereof by forcing an axe against them for thou mayest eat of them and thou shalt not cut them down for the tree of the field is man's life to employ them in the siege
only the trees which thou knowest that they be not trees for meat thou shalt destroy and cut them down and thou shalt build bulwarks against the city that maketh war with thee until it be subdued
if one be found slain in the land which the lord thy god giveth thee to possess it lying in the field and it be not known who hath slain him
then thy elders and thy judges shall come forth and they shall measure unto the cities which are round about him that is slain
and it shall be that the city which is next unto the slain man even the elders of that city shall take an heifer which hath not been wrought with and which hath not drawn in the yoke
and the elders of that city shall bring down the heifer unto a rough valley which is neither eared nor sown and shall strike off the heifer's neck there in the valley
and the priests the sons of levi shall come near for them the lord thy god hath chosen to minister unto him and to bless in the name of the lord and by their word shall every controversy and every stroke be tried
and all the elders of that city that are next unto the slain man shall wash their hands over the heifer that is beheaded in the valley
and they shall answer and say our hands have not shed this blood neither have our eyes seen it
be merciful o lord unto thy people israel whom thou hast redeemed and lay not innocent blood unto thy people of israel's charge and the blood shall be forgiven them
so shalt thou put away the guilt of innocent blood from among you when thou shalt do that which is right in the sight of the lord
when thou goest forth to war against thine enemies and the lord thy god hath delivered them into thine hands and thou hast taken them captive
and seest among the captives a beautiful woman and hast a desire unto her that thou wouldest have her to thy wife
then thou shalt bring her home to thine house and she shall shave her head and pare her nails
and she shall put the raiment of her captivity from off her and shall remain in thine house and bewail her father and her mother a full month and after that thou shalt go in unto her and be her husband and she shall be thy wife
and it shall be if thou have no delight in her then thou shalt let her go whither she will but thou shalt not sell her at all for money thou shalt not make merchandise of her because thou hast humbled her
if a man have two wives one beloved and another hated and they have born him children both the beloved and the hated and if the firstborn son be hers that was hated
then it shall be when he maketh his sons to inherit that which he hath that he may not make the son of the beloved firstborn before the son of the hated which is indeed the firstborn
but he shall acknowledge the son of the hated for the firstborn by giving him a double portion of all that he hath for he is the beginning of his strength the right of the firstborn is his
if a man have a stubborn and rebellious son which will not obey the voice of his father or the voice of his mother and that when they have chastened him will not hearken unto them
then shall his father and his mother lay hold on him and bring him out unto the elders of his city and unto the gate of his place
and they shall say unto the elders of his city this our son is stubborn and rebellious he will not obey our voice he is a glutton and a drunkard
and all the men of his city shall stone him with stones that he die so shalt thou put evil away from among you and all israel shall hear and fear
and if a man have committed a sin worthy of death and he be to be put to death and thou hang him on a tree
his body shall not remain all night upon the tree but thou shalt in any wise bury him that day for he that is hanged is accursed of god that thy land be not defiled which the lord thy god giveth thee for an inheritance
thou shalt not see thy brother's ox or his sheep go astray and hide thyself from them thou shalt in any case bring them again unto thy brother

if any man take a wife and go in unto her and hate her

and the damsel's father shall say unto the elders i gave my daughter unto this man to wife and he hateth her
and lo he hath given occasions of speech against her saying i found not thy daughter a maid and yet these are the tokens of my daughter's virginity and they shall spread the cloth before the elders of the city
and the elders of that city shall take that man and chastise him
and they shall amerce him in an hundred shekels of silver and give them unto the father of the damsel because he hath brought up an evil name upon a virgin of israel and she shall be his wife he may not put her away all his days
but if this thing be true and the tokens of virginity be not found for the damsel

but if a man find a betrothed damsel in the field and the man force her and lie with her then the man only that lay with her shall die
