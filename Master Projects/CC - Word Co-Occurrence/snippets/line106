it shall be the basest of the kingdoms neither shall it exalt itself any more above the nations for i will diminish them that they shall no more rule over the nations
and it shall be no more the confidence of the house of israel which bringeth their iniquity to remembrance when they shall look after them but they shall know that i am the lord god
and it came to pass in the seven and twentieth year in the first month in the first day of the month the word of the lord came unto me saying
son of man nebuchadrezzar king of babylon caused his army to serve a great service against tyrus every head was made bald and every shoulder was peeled yet had he no wages nor his army for tyrus for the service that he had served against it
therefore thus saith the lord god behold i will give the land of egypt unto nebuchadrezzar king of babylon and he shall take her multitude and take her spoil and take her prey and it shall be the wages for his army
i have given him the land of egypt for his labour wherewith he served against it because they wrought for me saith the lord god
in that day will i cause the horn of the house of israel to bud forth and i will give thee the opening of the mouth in the midst of them and they shall know that i am the lord
the word of the lord came again unto me saying
son of man prophesy and say thus saith the lord god howl ye woe worth the day
for the day is near even the day of the lord is near a cloudy day it shall be the time of the heathen
and the sword shall come upon egypt and great pain shall be in ethiopia when the slain shall fall in egypt and they shall take away her multitude and her foundations shall be broken down
ethiopia and libya and lydia and all the mingled people and chub and the men of the land that is in league shall fall with them by the sword
thus saith the lord they also that uphold egypt shall fall and the pride of her power shall come down from the tower of syene shall they fall in it by the sword saith the lord god
and they shall be desolate in the midst of the countries that are desolate and her cities shall be in the midst of the cities that are wasted
and they shall know that i am the lord when i have set a fire in egypt and when all her helpers shall be destroyed
in that day shall messengers go forth from me in ships to make the careless ethiopians afraid and great pain shall come upon them as in the day of egypt for lo it cometh
thus saith the lord god i will also make the multitude of egypt to cease by the hand of nebuchadrezzar king of babylon
he and his people with him the terrible of the nations shall be brought to destroy the land and they shall draw their swords against egypt and fill the land with the slain
and i will make the rivers dry and sell the land into the hand of the wicked and i will make the land waste and all that is therein by the hand of strangers i the lord have spoken it
thus saith the lord god i will also destroy the idols and i will cause their images to cease out of noph and there shall be no more a prince of the land of egypt and i will put a fear in the land of egypt
and i will make pathros desolate and will set fire in zoan and will execute judgments in no
and i will pour my fury upon sin the strength of egypt and i will cut off the multitude of no
and i will set fire in egypt sin shall have great pain and no shall be rent asunder and noph shall have distresses daily
the young men of aven and of pibeseth shall fall by the sword and these cities shall go into captivity
at tehaphnehes also the day shall be darkened when i shall break there the yokes of egypt and the pomp of her strength shall cease in her as for her a cloud shall cover her and her daughters shall go into captivity
thus will i execute judgments in egypt and they shall know that i am the lord
and it came to pass in the eleventh year in the first month in the seventh day of the month that the word of the lord came unto me saying
son of man i have broken the arm of pharaoh king of egypt and lo it shall not be bound up to be healed to put a roller to bind it to make it strong to hold the sword
therefore thus saith the lord god behold i am against pharaoh king of egypt and will break his arms the strong and that which was broken and i will cause the sword to fall out of his hand
and i will scatter the egyptians among the nations and will disperse them through the countries
and i will strengthen the arms of the king of babylon and put my sword in his hand but i will break pharaoh's arms and he shall groan before him with the groanings of a deadly wounded man
but i will strengthen the arms of the king of babylon and the arms of pharaoh shall fall down and they shall know that i am the lord when i shall put my sword into the hand of the king of babylon and he shall stretch it out upon the land of egypt
and i will scatter the egyptians among the nations and disperse them among the countries and they shall know that i am the lord
and it came to pass in the eleventh year in the third month in the first day of the month that the word of the lord came unto me saying
son of man speak unto pharaoh king of egypt and to his multitude whom art thou like in thy greatness
behold the assyrian was a cedar in lebanon with fair branches and with a shadowing shroud and of an high stature and his top was among the thick boughs
the waters made him great the deep set him up on high with her rivers running round about his plants and sent out her little rivers unto all the trees of the field
therefore his height was exalted above all the trees of the field and his boughs were multiplied and his branches became long because of the multitude of waters when he shot forth
all the fowls of heaven made their nests in his boughs and under his branches did all the beasts of the field bring forth their young and under his shadow dwelt all great nations
thus was he fair in his greatness in the length of his branches for his root was by great waters
the cedars in the garden of god could not hide him the fir trees were not like his boughs and the chestnut trees were not like his branches nor any tree in the garden of god was like unto him in his beauty
i have made him fair by the multitude of his branches so that all the trees of eden that were in the garden of god envied him
therefore thus saith the lord god because thou hast lifted up thyself in height and he hath shot up his top among the thick boughs and his heart is lifted up in his height
i have therefore delivered him into the hand of the mighty one of the heathen he shall surely deal with him i have driven him out for his wickedness
and strangers the terrible of the nations have cut him off and have left him upon the mountains and in all the valleys his branches are fallen and his boughs are broken by all the rivers of the land and all the people of the earth are gone down from his shadow and have left him
upon his ruin shall all the fowls of the heaven remain and all the beasts of the field shall be upon his branches
to the end that none of all the trees by the waters exalt themselves for their height neither shoot up their top among the thick boughs neither their trees stand up in their height all that drink water for they are all delivered unto death to the nether parts of the earth in the midst of the children of men with them that go down to the pit
thus saith the lord god in the day when he went down to the grave i caused a mourning i covered the deep for him and i restrained the floods thereof and the great waters were stayed and i caused lebanon to mourn for him and all the trees of the field fainted for him
i made the nations to shake at the sound of his fall when i cast him down to hell with them that descend into the pit and all the trees of eden the choice and best of lebanon all that drink water shall be comforted in the nether parts of the earth
they also went down into hell with him unto them that be slain with the sword and they that were his arm that dwelt under his shadow in the midst of the heathen
to whom art thou thus like in glory and in greatness among the trees of eden yet shalt thou be brought down with the trees of eden unto the nether parts of the earth thou shalt lie in the midst of the uncircumcised with them that be slain by the sword this is pharaoh and all his multitude saith the lord god
and it came to pass in the twelfth year in the twelfth month in the first day of the month that the word of the lord came unto me saying
son of man take up a lamentation for pharaoh king of egypt and say unto him thou art like a young lion of the nations and thou art as a whale in the seas and thou camest forth with thy rivers and troubledst the waters with thy feet and fouledst their rivers
thus saith the lord god i will therefore spread out my net over thee with a company of many people and they shall bring thee up in my net
then will i leave thee upon the land i will cast thee forth upon the open field and will cause all the fowls of the heaven to remain upon thee and i will fill the beasts of the whole earth with thee
and i will lay thy flesh upon the mountains and fill the valleys with thy height
i will also water with thy blood the land wherein thou swimmest even to the mountains and the rivers shall be full of thee
and when i shall put thee out i will cover the heaven and make the stars thereof dark i will cover the sun with a cloud and the moon shall not give her light
all the bright lights of heaven will i make dark over thee and set darkness upon thy land saith the lord god
i will also vex the hearts of many people when i shall bring thy destruction among the nations into the countries which thou hast not known
yea i will make many people amazed at thee and their kings shall be horribly afraid for thee when i shall brandish my sword before them and they shall tremble at every moment every man for his own life in the day of thy fall
for thus saith the lord god the sword of the king of babylon shall come upon thee
by the swords of the mighty will i cause thy multitude to fall the terrible of the nations all of them and they shall spoil the pomp of egypt and all the multitude thereof shall be destroyed
i will destroy also all the beasts thereof from beside the great waters neither shall the foot of man trouble them any more nor the hoofs of beasts trouble them
then will i make their waters deep and cause their rivers to run like oil saith the lord god
when i shall make the land of egypt desolate and the country shall be destitute of that whereof it was full when i shall smite all them that dwell therein then shall they know that i am the lord
this is the lamentation wherewith they shall lament her the daughters of the nations shall lament her they shall lament for her even for egypt and for all her multitude saith the lord god
it came to pass also in the twelfth year in the fifteenth day of the month that the word of the lord came unto me saying
son of man wail for the multitude of egypt and cast them down even her and the daughters of the famous nations unto the nether parts of the earth with them that go down into the pit
whom dost thou pass in beauty go down and be thou laid with the uncircumcised
they shall fall in the midst of them that are slain by the sword she is delivered to the sword draw her and all her multitudes
the strong among the mighty shall speak to him out of the midst of hell with them that help him they are gone down they lie uncircumcised slain by the sword
asshur is there and all her company his graves are about him all of them slain fallen by the sword
whose graves are set in the sides of the pit and her company is round about her grave all of them slain fallen by the sword which caused terror in the land of the living
there is elam and all her multitude round about her grave all of them slain fallen by the sword which are gone down uncircumcised into the nether parts of the earth which caused their terror in the land of the living yet have they borne their shame with them that go down to the pit
they have set her a bed in the midst of the slain with all her multitude her graves are round about him all of them uncircumcised slain by the sword though their terror was caused in the land of the living yet have they borne their shame with them that go down to the pit he is put in the midst of them that be slain
there is meshech tubal and all her multitude her graves are round about him all of them uncircumcised slain by the sword though they caused their terror in the land of the living
and they shall not lie with the mighty that are fallen of the uncircumcised which are gone down to hell with their weapons of war and they have laid their swords under their heads but their iniquities shall be upon their bones though they were the terror of the mighty in the land of the living
yea thou shalt be broken in the midst of the uncircumcised and shalt lie with them that are slain with the sword
there is edom her kings and all her princes which with their might are laid by them that were slain by the sword they shall lie with the uncircumcised and with them that go down to the pit
there be the princes of the north all of them and all the zidonians which are gone down with the slain with their terror they are ashamed of their might and they lie uncircumcised with them that be slain by the sword and bear their shame with them that go down to the pit
pharaoh shall see them and shall be comforted over all his multitude even pharaoh and all his army slain by the sword saith the lord god
for i have caused my terror in the land of the living and he shall be laid in the midst of the uncircumcised with them that are slain with the sword even pharaoh and all his multitude saith the lord god
again the word of the lord came unto me saying
son of man speak to the children of thy people and say unto them when i bring the sword upon a land if the people of the land take a man of their coasts and set him for their watchman
if when he seeth the sword come upon the land he blow the trumpet and warn the people
then whosoever heareth the sound of the trumpet and taketh not warning if the sword come and take him away his blood shall be upon his own head
he heard the sound of the trumpet and took not warning his blood shall be upon him but he that taketh warning shall deliver his soul
but if the watchman see the sword come and blow not the trumpet and the people be not warned if the sword come and take any person from among them he is taken away in his iniquity but his blood will i require at the watchman's hand
so thou o son of man i have set thee a watchman unto the house of israel therefore thou shalt hear the word at my mouth and warn them from me
when i say unto the wicked o wicked man thou shalt surely die if thou dost not speak to warn the wicked from his way that wicked man shall die in his iniquity but his blood will i require at thine hand
nevertheless if thou warn the wicked of his way to turn from it if he do not turn from his way he shall die in his iniquity but thou hast delivered thy soul
therefore o thou son of man speak unto the house of israel thus ye speak saying if our transgressions and our sins be upon us and we pine away in them how should we then live
say unto them as i live saith the lord god i have no pleasure in the death of the wicked but that the wicked turn from his way and live turn ye turn ye from your evil ways for why will ye die o house of israel
therefore thou son of man say unto the children of thy people the righteousness of the righteous shall not deliver him in the day of his transgression as for the wickedness of the wicked he shall not fall thereby in the day that he turneth from his wickedness neither shall the righteous be able to live for his righteousness in the day that he sinneth
when i shall say to the righteous that he shall surely live if he trust to his own righteousness and commit iniquity all his righteousnesses shall not be remembered but for his iniquity that he hath committed he shall die for it
again when i say unto the wicked thou shalt surely die if he turn from his sin and do that which is lawful and right
if the wicked restore the pledge give again that he had robbed walk in the statutes of life without committing iniquity he shall surely live he shall not die
none of his sins that he hath committed shall be mentioned unto him he hath done that which is lawful and right he shall surely live
yet the children of thy people say the way of the lord is not equal but as for them their way is not equal
when the righteous turneth from his righteousness and committeth iniquity he shall even die thereby
but if the wicked turn from his wickedness and do that which is lawful and right he shall live thereby
yet ye say the way of the lord is not equal o ye house of israel i will judge you every one after his ways
and it came to pass in the twelfth year of our captivity in the tenth month in the fifth day of the month that one that had escaped out of jerusalem came unto me saying the city is smitten
now the hand of the lord was upon me in the evening afore he that was escaped came and had opened my mouth until he came to me in the morning and my mouth was opened and i was no more dumb
then the word of the lord came unto me saying
son of man they that inhabit those wastes of the land of israel speak saying abraham was one and he inherited the land but we are many the land is given us for inheritance
wherefore say unto them thus saith the lord god ye eat with the blood and lift up your eyes toward your idols and shed blood and shall ye possess the land
ye stand upon your sword ye work abomination and ye defile every one his neighbour's wife and shall ye possess the land
say thou thus unto them thus saith the lord god as i live surely they that are in the wastes shall fall by the sword and him that is in the open field will i give to the beasts to be devoured and they that be in the forts and in the caves shall die of the pestilence
for i will lay the land most desolate and the pomp of her strength shall cease and the mountains of israel shall be desolate that none shall pass through
then shall they know that i am the lord when i have laid the land most desolate because of all their abominations which they have committed
also thou son of man the children of thy people still are talking against thee by the walls and in the doors of the houses and speak one to another every one to his brother saying come i pray you and hear what is the word that cometh forth from the lord
and they come unto thee as the people cometh and they sit before thee as my people and they hear thy words but they will not do them for with their mouth they shew much love but their heart goeth after their covetousness
and lo thou art unto them as a very lovely song of one that hath a pleasant voice and can play well on an instrument for they hear thy words but they do them not
and when this cometh to pass lo it will come then shall they know that a prophet hath been among them
and the word of the lord came unto me saying
son of man prophesy against the shepherds of israel prophesy and say unto them thus saith the lord god unto the shepherds woe be to the shepherds of israel that do feed themselves should not the shepherds feed the flocks
ye eat the fat and ye clothe you with the wool ye kill them that are fed but ye feed not the flock
the diseased have ye not strengthened neither have ye healed that which was sick neither have ye bound up that which was broken neither have ye brought again that which was driven away neither have ye sought that which was lost but with force and with cruelty have ye ruled them
and they were scattered because there is no shepherd and they became meat to all the beasts of the field when they were scattered
my sheep wandered through all the mountains and upon every high hill yea my flock was scattered upon all the face of the earth and none did search or seek after them
therefore ye shepherds hear the word of the lord
as i live saith the lord god surely because my flock became a prey and my flock became meat to every beast of the field because there was no shepherd neither did my shepherds search for my flock but the shepherds fed themselves and fed not my flock
therefore o ye shepherds hear the word of the lord
thus saith the lord god behold i am against the shepherds and i will require my flock at their hand and cause them to cease from feeding the flock neither shall the shepherds feed themselves any more for i will deliver my flock from their mouth that they may not be meat for them
for thus saith the lord god behold i even i will both search my sheep and seek them out
as a shepherd seeketh out his flock in the day that he is among his sheep that are scattered so will i seek out my sheep and will deliver them out of all places where they have been scattered in the cloudy and dark day
and i will bring them out from the people and gather them from the countries and will bring them to their own land and feed them upon the mountains of israel by the rivers and in all the inhabited places of the country
i will feed them in a good pasture and upon the high mountains of israel shall their fold be there shall they lie in a good fold and in a fat pasture shall they feed upon the mountains of israel
i will feed my flock and i will cause them to lie down saith the lord god
i will seek that which was lost and bring again that which was driven away and will bind up that which was broken and will strengthen that which was sick but i will destroy the fat and the strong i will feed them with judgment
and as for you o my flock thus saith the lord god behold i judge between cattle and cattle between the rams and the he goats
seemeth it a small thing unto you to have eaten up the good pasture but ye must tread down with your feet the residue of your pastures and to have drunk of the deep waters but ye must foul the residue with your feet
and as for my flock they eat that which ye have trodden with your feet and they drink that which ye have fouled with your feet
therefore thus saith the lord god unto them behold i even i will judge between the fat cattle and between the lean cattle
because ye have thrust with side and with shoulder and pushed all the diseased with your horns till ye have scattered them abroad
therefore will i save my flock and they shall no more be a prey and i will judge between cattle and cattle
and i will set up one shepherd over them and he shall feed them even my servant david he shall feed them and he shall be their shepherd
and i the lord will be their god and my servant david a prince among them i the lord have spoken it
and i will make with them a covenant of peace and will cause the evil beasts to cease out of the land and they shall dwell safely in the wilderness and sleep in the woods
and i will make them and the places round about my hill a blessing and i will cause the shower to come down in his season there shall be showers of blessing
and the tree of the field shall yield her fruit and the earth shall yield her increase and they shall be safe in their land and shall know that i am the lord when i have broken the bands of their yoke and delivered them out of the hand of those that served themselves of them
and they shall no more be a prey to the heathen neither shall the beast of the land devour them but they shall dwell safely and none shall make them afraid
and i will raise up for them a plant of renown and they shall be no more consumed with hunger in the land neither bear the shame of the heathen any more
thus shall they know that i the lord their god am with them and that they even the house of israel are my people saith the lord god
and ye my flock the flock of my pasture are men and i am your god saith the lord god
moreover the word of the lord came unto me saying
son of man set thy face against mount seir and prophesy against it
and say unto it thus saith the lord god behold o mount seir i am against thee and i will stretch out mine hand against thee and i will make thee most desolate
i will lay thy cities waste and thou shalt be desolate and thou shalt know that i am the lord
because thou hast had a perpetual hatred and hast shed the blood of the children of israel by the force of the sword in the time of their calamity in the time that their iniquity had an end
therefore as i live saith the lord god i will prepare thee unto blood and blood shall pursue thee sith thou hast not hated blood even blood shall pursue thee
thus will i make mount seir most desolate and cut off from it him that passeth out and him that returneth
and i will fill his mountains with his slain men in thy hills and in thy valleys and in all thy rivers shall they fall that are slain with the sword
i will make thee perpetual desolations and thy cities shall not return and ye shall know that i am the lord
because thou hast said these two nations and these two countries shall be mine and we will possess it whereas the lord was there
therefore as i live saith the lord god i will even do according to thine anger and according to thine envy which thou hast used out of thy hatred against them and i will make myself known among them when i have judged thee
and thou shalt know that i am the lord and that i have heard all thy blasphemies which thou hast spoken against the mountains of israel saying they are laid desolate they are given us to consume
thus with your mouth ye have boasted against me and have multiplied your words against me i have heard them
thus saith the lord god when the whole earth rejoiceth i will make thee desolate
as thou didst rejoice at the inheritance of the house of israel because it was desolate so will i do unto thee thou shalt be desolate o mount seir and all idumea even all of it and they shall know that i am the lord
also thou son of man prophesy unto the mountains of israel and say ye mountains of israel hear the word of the lord
thus saith the lord god because the enemy hath said against you aha even the ancient high places are ours in possession
therefore prophesy and say thus saith the lord god because they have made you desolate and swallowed you up on every side that ye might be a possession unto the residue of the heathen and ye are taken up in the lips of talkers and are an infamy of the people
therefore ye mountains of israel hear the word of the lord god thus saith the lord god to the mountains and to the hills to the rivers and to the valleys to the desolate wastes and to the cities that are forsaken which became a prey and derision to the residue of the heathen that are round about
therefore thus saith the lord god surely in the fire of my jealousy have i spoken against the residue of the heathen and against all idumea which have appointed my land into their possession with the joy of all their heart with despiteful minds to cast it out for a prey
prophesy therefore concerning the land of israel and say unto the mountains and to the hills to the rivers and to the valleys thus saith the lord god behold i have spoken in my jealousy and in my fury because ye have borne the shame of the heathen
therefore thus saith the lord god i have lifted up mine hand surely the heathen that are about you they shall bear their shame
but ye o mountains of israel ye shall shoot forth your branches and yield your fruit to my people of israel for they are at hand to come
for behold i am for you and i will turn unto you and ye shall be tilled and sown
and i will multiply men upon you all the house of israel even all of it and the cities shall be inhabited and the wastes shall be builded
and i will multiply upon you man and beast and they shall increase and bring fruit and i will settle you after your old estates and will do better unto you than at your beginnings and ye shall know that i am the lord
yea i will cause men to walk upon you even my people israel and they shall possess thee and thou shalt be their inheritance and thou shalt no more henceforth bereave them of men
thus saith the lord god because they say unto you thou land devourest up men and hast bereaved thy nations
therefore thou shalt devour men no more neither bereave thy nations any more saith the lord god
neither will i cause men to hear in thee the shame of the heathen any more neither shalt thou bear the reproach of the people any more neither shalt thou cause thy nations to fall any more saith the lord god
moreover the word of the lord came unto me saying
son of man when the house of israel dwelt in their own land they defiled it by their own way and by their doings their way was before me as the uncleanness of a removed woman
wherefore i poured my fury upon them for the blood that they had shed upon the land and for their idols wherewith they had polluted it
and i scattered them among the heathen and they were dispersed through the countries according to their way and according to their doings i judged them
and when they entered unto the heathen whither they went they profaned my holy name when they said to them these are the people of the lord and are gone forth out of his land
but i had pity for mine holy name which the house of israel had profaned among the heathen whither they went
therefore say unto the house of israel thus saith the lord god i do not this for your sakes o house of israel but for mine holy name's sake which ye have profaned among the heathen whither ye went
and i will sanctify my great name which was profaned among the heathen which ye have profaned in the midst of them and the heathen shall know that i am the lord saith the lord god when i shall be sanctified in you before their eyes
for i will take you from among the heathen and gather you out of all countries and will bring you into your own land
then will i sprinkle clean water upon you and ye shall be clean from all your filthiness and from all your idols will i cleanse you
a new heart also will i give you and a new spirit will i put within you and i will take away the stony heart out of your flesh and i will give you an heart of flesh
and i will put my spirit within you and cause you to walk in my statutes and ye shall keep my judgments and do them
and ye shall dwell in the land that i gave to your fathers and ye shall be my people and i will be your god
i will also save you from all your uncleannesses and i will call for the corn and will increase it and lay no famine upon you
and i will multiply the fruit of the tree and the increase of the field that ye shall receive no more reproach of famine among the heathen
then shall ye remember your own evil ways and your doings that were not good and shall lothe yourselves in your own sight for your iniquities and for your abominations
not for your sakes do i this saith the lord god be it known unto you be ashamed and confounded for your own ways o house of israel
thus saith the lord god in the day that i shall have cleansed you from all your iniquities i will also cause you to dwell in the cities and the wastes shall be builded
and the desolate land shall be tilled whereas it lay desolate in the sight of all that passed by
and they shall say this land that was desolate is become like the garden of eden and the waste and desolate and ruined cities are become fenced and are inhabited
then the heathen that are left round about you shall know that i the lord build the ruined places and plant that that was desolate i the lord have spoken it and i will do it
thus saith the lord god i will yet for this be enquired of by the house of israel to do it for them i will increase them with men like a flock
as the holy flock as the flock of jerusalem in her solemn feasts so shall the waste cities be filled with flocks of men and they shall know that i am the lord
