 he faints
 alarum and retreat enter edward george richard
 montague warwick and soldiers
edward now breathe we lords good fortune bids us pause
 and smooth the frowns of war with peaceful looks
 some troops pursue the bloodyminded queen
 that led calm henry though he were a king
 as doth a sail fill'd with a fretting gust
 command an argosy to stem the waves
 but think you lords that clifford fled with them
warwick no tis impossible he should escape
 for though before his face i speak the words
 your brother richard mark'd him for the grave
 and wheresoe'er he is he's surely dead
 clifford groans and dies
edward whose soul is that which takes her heavy leave
richard a deadly groan like life and death's departing
edward see who it is and now the battle's ended
 if friend or foe let him be gently used
richard revoke that doom of mercy for tis clifford
 who not contented that he lopp'd the branch
 in hewing rutland when his leaves put forth
 but set his murdering knife unto the root
 from whence that tender spray did sweetly spring
 i mean our princely father duke of york
warwick from off the gates of york fetch down the head
 your father's head which clifford placed there
 instead whereof let this supply the room
 measure for measure must be answered
edward bring forth that fatal screechowl to our house
 that nothing sung but death to us and ours
 now death shall stop his dismal threatening sound
 and his illboding tongue no more shall speak
warwick i think his understanding is bereft
 speak clifford dost thou know who speaks to thee
 dark cloudy death o'ershades his beams of life
 and he nor sees nor hears us what we say
richard o would he did and so perhaps he doth
 tis but his policy to counterfeit
 because he would avoid such bitter taunts
 which in the time of death he gave our father
george if so thou think'st vex him with eager words
richard clifford ask mercy and obtain no grace
edward clifford repent in bootless penitence
warwick clifford devise excuses for thy faults
george while we devise fell tortures for thy faults
richard thou didst love york and i am son to york
edward thou pitied'st rutland i will pity thee
george where's captain margaret to fence you now
warwick they mock thee clifford swear as thou wast wont
richard what not an oath nay then the world goes hard
 when clifford cannot spare his friends an oath
 i know by that he's dead and by my soul
 if this right hand would buy two hour's life
 that i in all despite might rail at him
 this hand should chop it off and with the
 issuing blood
 stifle the villain whose unstanched thirst
 york and young rutland could not satisfy
warwick ay but he's dead off with the traitor's head
 and rear it in the place your father's stands
 and now to london with triumphant march
 there to be crowned england's royal king
 from whence shall warwick cut the sea to france
 and ask the lady bona for thy queen
 so shalt thou sinew both these lands together
 and having france thy friend thou shalt not dread
 the scatter'd foe that hopes to rise again
 for though they cannot greatly sting to hurt
 yet look to have them buzz to offend thine ears
 first will i see the coronation
 and then to brittany i'll cross the sea
 to effect this marriage so it please my lord
edward even as thou wilt sweet warwick let it be
 for in thy shoulder do i build my seat
 and never will i undertake the thing
 wherein thy counsel and consent is wanting
 richard i will create thee duke of gloucester
 and george of clarence warwick as ourself
 shall do and undo as him pleaseth best
richard let me be duke of clarence george of gloucester
 for gloucester's dukedom is too ominous
warwick tut that's a foolish observation
 richard be duke of gloucester now to london
 to see these honours in possession

act iii
scene i a forest in the north of england
 enter two keepers with crossbows in their hands
first keeper under this thickgrown brake we'll shroud ourselves
 for through this laund anon the deer will come
 and in this covert will we make our stand
 culling the principal of all the deer
second keeper i'll stay above the hill so both may shoot
first keeper that cannot be the noise of thy crossbow
 will scare the herd and so my shoot is lost
 here stand we both and aim we at the best
 and for the time shall not seem tedious
 i'll tell thee what befell me on a day
 in this selfplace where now we mean to stand
second keeper here comes a man let's stay till he be past
 enter king henry vi disguised with a prayerbook
king henry vi from scotland am i stol'n even of pure love
 to greet mine own land with my wishful sight
 no harry harry tis no land of thine
 thy place is fill'd thy sceptre wrung from thee
 thy balm wash'd off wherewith thou wast anointed
 no bending knee will call thee caesar now
 no humble suitors press to speak for right
 no not a man comes for redress of thee
 for how can i help them and not myself
first keeper ay here's a deer whose skin's a keeper's fee
 this is the quondam king let's seize upon him
king henry vi let me embrace thee sour adversity
 for wise men say it is the wisest course
second keeper why linger we let us lay hands upon him
first keeper forbear awhile we'll hear a little more
king henry vi my queen and son are gone to france for aid
 and as i hear the great commanding warwick
 is thither gone to crave the french king's sister
 to wife for edward if this news be true
 poor queen and son your labour is but lost
 for warwick is a subtle orator
 and lewis a prince soon won with moving words
 by this account then margaret may win him
 for she's a woman to be pitied much
 her sighs will make a battery in his breast
 her tears will pierce into a marble heart
 the tiger will be mild whiles she doth mourn
 and nero will be tainted with remorse
 to hear and see her plaints her brinish tears
 ay but she's come to beg warwick to give
 she on his left side craving aid for henry
 he on his right asking a wife for edward
 she weeps and says her henry is deposed
 he smiles and says his edward is install'd
 that she poor wretch for grief can speak no more
 whiles warwick tells his title smooths the wrong
 inferreth arguments of mighty strength
 and in conclusion wins the king from her
 with promise of his sister and what else
 to strengthen and support king edward's place
 o margaret thus twill be and thou poor soul
 art then forsaken as thou went'st forlorn
second keeper say what art thou that talk'st of kings and queens
king henry vi more than i seem and less than i was born to
 a man at least for less i should not be
 and men may talk of kings and why not i
second keeper ay but thou talk'st as if thou wert a king
king henry vi why so i am in mind and that's enough
second keeper but if thou be a king where is thy crown
king henry vi my crown is in my heart not on my head
 not decked with diamonds and indian stones
 nor to be seen my crown is called content
 a crown it is that seldom kings enjoy
second keeper well if you be a king crown'd with content
 your crown content and you must be contented
 to go along with us for as we think
 you are the king king edward hath deposed
 and we his subjects sworn in all allegiance
 will apprehend you as his enemy
king henry vi but did you never swear and break an oath
second keeper no never such an oath nor will not now
king henry vi where did you dwell when i was king of england
second keeper here in this country where we now remain
king henry vi i was anointed king at nine months old
 my father and my grandfather were kings
 and you were sworn true subjects unto me
 and tell me then have you not broke your oaths
first keeper no
 for we were subjects but while you were king
king henry vi why am i dead do i not breathe a man
 ah simple men you know not what you swear
 look as i blow this feather from my face
 and as the air blows it to me again
 obeying with my wind when i do blow
 and yielding to another when it blows
 commanded always by the greater gust
 such is the lightness of you common men
 but do not break your oaths for of that sin
 my mild entreaty shall not make you guilty
 go where you will the king shall be commanded
 and be you kings command and i'll obey
first keeper we are true subjects to the king king edward
king henry vi so would you be again to henry
 if he were seated as king edward is
first keeper we charge you in god's name and the king's
 to go with us unto the officers
king henry vi in god's name lead your king's name be obey'd
 and what god will that let your king perform
 and what he will i humbly yield unto
