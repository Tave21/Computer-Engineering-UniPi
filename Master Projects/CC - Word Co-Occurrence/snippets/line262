lady macduff whither should i fly
 i have done no harm but i remember now
 i am in this earthly world where to do harm
 is often laudable to do good sometime
 accounted dangerous folly why then alas
 do i put up that womanly defence
 to say i have done no harm
 enter murderers
 what are these faces
first murderer where is your husband
lady macduff i hope in no place so unsanctified
 where such as thou mayst find him
first murderer he's a traitor
son thou liest thou shaghair'd villain
first murderer what you egg
 stabbing him
 young fry of treachery
son he has kill'd me mother
 run away i pray you
 dies
 exit lady macduff crying murder exeunt
 murderers following her
 macbeth
act iv
scene iii england before the king's palace
 enter malcolm and macduff
malcolm let us seek out some desolate shade and there
 weep our sad bosoms empty
macduff let us rather
 hold fast the mortal sword and like good men
 bestride our downfall'n birthdom each new morn
 new widows howl new orphans cry new sorrows
 strike heaven on the face that it resounds
 as if it felt with scotland and yell'd out
 like syllable of dolour
malcolm what i believe i'll wail
 what know believe and what i can redress
 as i shall find the time to friend i will
 what you have spoke it may be so perchance
 this tyrant whose sole name blisters our tongues
 was once thought honest you have loved him well
 he hath not touch'd you yet i am young
 but something
 you may deserve of him through me and wisdom
 to offer up a weak poor innocent lamb
 to appease an angry god
macduff i am not treacherous
malcolm but macbeth is
 a good and virtuous nature may recoil
 in an imperial charge but i shall crave
 your pardon
 that which you are my thoughts cannot transpose
 angels are bright still though the brightest fell
 though all things foul would wear the brows of grace
 yet grace must still look so
macduff i have lost my hopes
malcolm perchance even there where i did find my doubts
 why in that rawness left you wife and child
 those precious motives those strong knots of love
 without leavetaking i pray you
 let not my jealousies be your dishonours
 but mine own safeties you may be rightly just
 whatever i shall think
macduff bleed bleed poor country
 great tyranny lay thou thy basis sure
 for goodness dare not cheque thee wear thou
 thy wrongs
 the title is affeer'd fare thee well lord
 i would not be the villain that thou think'st
 for the whole space that's in the tyrant's grasp
 and the rich east to boot
malcolm be not offended
 i speak not as in absolute fear of you
 i think our country sinks beneath the yoke
 it weeps it bleeds and each new day a gash
 is added to her wounds i think withal
 there would be hands uplifted in my right
 and here from gracious england have i offer
 of goodly thousands but for all this
 when i shall tread upon the tyrant's head
 or wear it on my sword yet my poor country
 shall have more vices than it had before
 more suffer and more sundry ways than ever
 by him that shall succeed
macduff what should he be
malcolm it is myself i mean in whom i know
 all the particulars of vice so grafted
 that when they shall be open'd black macbeth
 will seem as pure as snow and the poor state
 esteem him as a lamb being compared
 with my confineless harms
macduff not in the legions
 of horrid hell can come a devil more damn'd
 in evils to top macbeth
malcolm i grant him bloody
 luxurious avaricious false deceitful
 sudden malicious smacking of every sin
 that has a name but there's no bottom none
 in my voluptuousness your wives your daughters
 your matrons and your maids could not fill up
 the cistern of my lust and my desire
 all continent impediments would o'erbear
 that did oppose my will better macbeth
 than such an one to reign
macduff boundless intemperance
 in nature is a tyranny it hath been
 the untimely emptying of the happy throne
 and fall of many kings but fear not yet
 to take upon you what is yours you may
 convey your pleasures in a spacious plenty
 and yet seem cold the time you may so hoodwink
 we have willing dames enough there cannot be
 that vulture in you to devour so many
 as will to greatness dedicate themselves
 finding it so inclined
malcolm with this there grows
 in my most illcomposed affection such
 a stanchless avarice that were i king
 i should cut off the nobles for their lands
 desire his jewels and this other's house
 and my morehaving would be as a sauce
 to make me hunger more that i should forge
 quarrels unjust against the good and loyal
 destroying them for wealth
macduff this avarice
 sticks deeper grows with more pernicious root
 than summerseeming lust and it hath been
 the sword of our slain kings yet do not fear
 scotland hath foisons to fill up your will
 of your mere own all these are portable
 with other graces weigh'd
malcolm but i have none the kingbecoming graces
 as justice verity temperance stableness
 bounty perseverance mercy lowliness
 devotion patience courage fortitude
 i have no relish of them but abound
 in the division of each several crime
 acting it many ways nay had i power i should
 pour the sweet milk of concord into hell
 uproar the universal peace confound
 all unity on earth
macduff o scotland scotland
malcolm if such a one be fit to govern speak
 i am as i have spoken
macduff fit to govern
 no not to live o nation miserable
 with an untitled tyrant bloodyscepter'd
 when shalt thou see thy wholesome days again
 since that the truest issue of thy throne
 by his own interdiction stands accursed
 and does blaspheme his breed thy royal father
 was a most sainted king the queen that bore thee
 oftener upon her knees than on her feet
 died every day she lived fare thee well
 these evils thou repeat'st upon thyself
 have banish'd me from scotland o my breast
 thy hope ends here
malcolm macduff this noble passion
 child of integrity hath from my soul
 wiped the black scruples reconciled my thoughts
 to thy good truth and honour devilish macbeth
 by many of these trains hath sought to win me
 into his power and modest wisdom plucks me
 from overcredulous haste but god above
 deal between thee and me for even now
 i put myself to thy direction and
 unspeak mine own detraction here abjure
 the taints and blames i laid upon myself
 for strangers to my nature i am yet
 unknown to woman never was forsworn
 scarcely have coveted what was mine own
 at no time broke my faith would not betray
 the devil to his fellow and delight
 no less in truth than life my first false speaking
 was this upon myself what i am truly
 is thine and my poor country's to command
 whither indeed before thy hereapproach
 old siward with ten thousand warlike men
 already at a point was setting forth
 now we'll together and the chance of goodness
 be like our warranted quarrel why are you silent
macduff such welcome and unwelcome things at once
 tis hard to reconcile
 enter a doctor
malcolm well more anoncomes the king forth i pray you
doctor ay sir there are a crew of wretched souls
 that stay his cure their malady convinces
 the great assay of art but at his touch
 such sanctity hath heaven given his hand
 they presently amend
malcolm i thank you doctor
 exit doctor
macduff what's the disease he means
malcolm tis call'd the evil
 a most miraculous work in this good king
 which often since my hereremain in england
 i have seen him do how he solicits heaven
 himself best knows but strangelyvisited people
 all swoln and ulcerous pitiful to the eye
 the mere despair of surgery he cures
