queen elizabeth till then fair hope must hinder life's decay
 and i the rather wean me from despair
 for love of edward's offspring in my womb
 this is it that makes me bridle passion
 and bear with mildness my misfortune's cross
 ay ay for this i draw in many a tear
 and stop the rising of bloodsucking sighs
 lest with my sighs or tears i blast or drown
 king edward's fruit true heir to the english crown
rivers but madam where is warwick then become
queen elizabeth i am inform'd that he comes towards london
 to set the crown once more on henry's head
 guess thou the rest king edward's friends must down
 but to prevent the tyrant's violence
 for trust not him that hath once broken faith
 i'll hence forthwith unto the sanctuary
 to save at least the heir of edward's right
 there shall i rest secure from force and fraud
 come therefore let us fly while we may fly
 if warwick take us we are sure to die

act iv
scene v a park near middleham castle in yorkshire
 enter gloucester hastings and stanley
gloucester now my lord hastings and sir william stanley
 leave off to wonder why i drew you hither
 into this chiefest thicket of the park
 thus stands the case you know our king my brother
 is prisoner to the bishop here at whose hands
 he hath good usage and great liberty
 and often but attended with weak guard
 comes hunting this way to disport himself
 i have advertised him by secret means
 that if about this hour he make his way
 under the colour of his usual game
 he shall here find his friends with horse and men
 to set him free from his captivity
 enter king edward iv and a huntsman with him
huntsman this way my lord for this way lies the game
king edward iv nay this way man see where the huntsmen stand
 now brother of gloucester lord hastings and the rest
 stand you thus close to steal the bishop's deer
gloucester brother the time and case requireth haste
 your horse stands ready at the parkcorner
king edward iv but whither shall we then
hastings to lynn my lord
 and ship from thence to flanders
gloucester well guess'd believe me for that was my meaning
king edward iv stanley i will requite thy forwardness
gloucester but wherefore stay we tis no time to talk
king edward iv huntsman what say'st thou wilt thou go along
huntsman better do so than tarry and be hang'd
gloucester come then away let's ha no more ado
king edward iv bishop farewell shield thee from warwick's frown
 and pray that i may repossess the crown

 3 king henry vi
act iv
scene vi london the tower
 flourish enter king henry vi clarence warwick
 somerset henry of richmond oxford montague and
 lieutenant of the tower
king henry vi master lieutenant now that god and friends
 have shaken edward from the regal seat
 and turn'd my captive state to liberty
 my fear to hope my sorrows unto joys
 at our enlargement what are thy due fees
lieutenant subjects may challenge nothing of their sovereigns
 but if an humble prayer may prevail
 i then crave pardon of your majesty
king henry vi for what lieutenant for well using me
 nay be thou sure i'll well requite thy kindness
 for that it made my imprisonment a pleasure
 ay such a pleasure as incaged birds
 conceive when after many moody thoughts
 at last by notes of household harmony
 they quite forget their loss of liberty
 but warwick after god thou set'st me free
 and chiefly therefore i thank god and thee
 he was the author thou the instrument
 therefore that i may conquer fortune's spite
 by living low where fortune cannot hurt me
 and that the people of this blessed land
 may not be punish'd with my thwarting stars
 warwick although my head still wear the crown
 i here resign my government to thee
 for thou art fortunate in all thy deeds
warwick your grace hath still been famed for virtuous
 and now may seem as wise as virtuous
 by spying and avoiding fortune's malice
 for few men rightly temper with the stars
 yet in this one thing let me blame your grace
 for choosing me when clarence is in place
clarence no warwick thou art worthy of the sway
 to whom the heavens in thy nativity
 adjudged an olive branch and laurel crown
 as likely to be blest in peace and war
 and therefore i yield thee my free consent
warwick and i choose clarence only for protector
king henry vi warwick and clarence give me both your hands
 now join your hands and with your hands your hearts
 that no dissension hinder government
 i make you both protectors of this land
 while i myself will lead a private life
 and in devotion spend my latter days
 to sin's rebuke and my creator's praise
warwick what answers clarence to his sovereign's will
clarence that he consents if warwick yield consent
 for on thy fortune i repose myself
warwick why then though loath yet must i be content
 we'll yoke together like a double shadow
 to henry's body and supply his place
 i mean in bearing weight of government
 while he enjoys the honour and his ease
 and clarence now then it is more than needful
 forthwith that edward be pronounced a traitor
 and all his lands and goods be confiscate
clarence what else and that succession be determined
warwick ay therein clarence shall not want his part
king henry vi but with the first of all your chief affairs
 let me entreat for i command no more
 that margaret your queen and my son edward
 be sent for to return from france with speed
 for till i see them here by doubtful fear
 my joy of liberty is half eclipsed
clarence it shall be done my sovereign with all speed
king henry vi my lord of somerset what youth is that
 of whom you seem to have so tender care
somerset my liege it is young henry earl of richmond
king henry vi come hither england's hope
 lays his hand on his head
 if secret powers
 suggest but truth to my divining thoughts
 this pretty lad will prove our country's bliss
 his looks are full of peaceful majesty
 his head by nature framed to wear a crown
 his hand to wield a sceptre and himself
 likely in time to bless a regal throne
 make much of him my lords for this is he
 must help you more than you are hurt by me
 enter a post
warwick what news my friend
post that edward is escaped from your brother
 and fled as he hears since to burgundy
warwick unsavoury news but how made he escape
post he was convey'd by richard duke of gloucester
 and the lord hastings who attended him
 in secret ambush on the forest side
 and from the bishop's huntsmen rescued him
 for hunting was his daily exercise
warwick my brother was too careless of his charge
 but let us hence my sovereign to provide
 a salve for any sore that may betide
 exeunt all but somerset henry of richmond and oxford
somerset my lord i like not of this flight of edward's
 for doubtless burgundy will yield him help
 and we shall have more wars before t be long
 as henry's late presaging prophecy
 did glad my heart with hope of this young richmond
 so doth my heart misgive me in these conflicts
 what may befall him to his harm and ours
 therefore lord oxford to prevent the worst
 forthwith we'll send him hence to brittany
 till storms be past of civil enmity
oxford ay for if edward repossess the crown
 tis like that richmond with the rest shall down
somerset it shall be so he shall to brittany
 come therefore let's about it speedily

 3 king henry vi
act iv
scene vii before york
 flourish enter king edward iv gloucester
 hastings and soldiers
king edward iv now brother richard lord hastings and the rest
 yet thus far fortune maketh us amends
 and says that once more i shall interchange
 my waned state for henry's regal crown
 well have we pass'd and now repass'd the seas
 and brought desired help from burgundy
 what then remains we being thus arrived
 from ravenspurgh haven before the gates of york
 but that we enter as into our dukedom
gloucester the gates made fast brother i like not this
 for many men that stumble at the threshold
 are well foretold that danger lurks within
king edward iv tush man abodements must not now affright us
 by fair or foul means we must enter in
 for hither will our friends repair to us
hastings my liege i'll knock once more to summon them
 enter on the walls the mayor of york and his brethren
mayor my lords we were forewarned of your coming
 and shut the gates for safety of ourselves
 for now we owe allegiance unto henry
king edward iv but master mayor if henry be your king
 yet edward at the least is duke of york
mayor true my good lord i know you for no less
king edward iv why and i challenge nothing but my dukedom
 as being well content with that alone
