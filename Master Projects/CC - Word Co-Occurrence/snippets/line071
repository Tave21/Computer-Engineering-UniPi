for the king trusteth in the lord and through the mercy of the most high he shall not be moved
thine hand shall find out all thine enemies thy right hand shall find out those that hate thee
thou shalt make them as a fiery oven in the time of thine anger the lord shall swallow them up in his wrath and the fire shall devour them
their fruit shalt thou destroy from the earth and their seed from among the children of men
for they intended evil against thee they imagined a mischievous device which they are not able to perform
therefore shalt thou make them turn their back when thou shalt make ready thine arrows upon thy strings against the face of them
be thou exalted lord in thine own strength so will we sing and praise thy power
my god my god why hast thou forsaken me why art thou so far from helping me and from the words of my roaring
o my god i cry in the day time but thou hearest not and in the night season and am not silent
but thou art holy o thou that inhabitest the praises of israel
our fathers trusted in thee they trusted and thou didst deliver them
they cried unto thee and were delivered they trusted in thee and were not confounded
but i am a worm and no man a reproach of men and despised of the people
all they that see me laugh me to scorn they shoot out the lip they shake the head saying
he trusted on the lord that he would deliver him let him deliver him seeing he delighted in him
but thou art he that took me out of the womb thou didst make me hope when i was upon my mother's breasts
i was cast upon thee from the womb thou art my god from my mother's belly
be not far from me for trouble is near for there is none to help
many bulls have compassed me strong bulls of bashan have beset me round
they gaped upon me with their mouths as a ravening and a roaring lion
i am poured out like water and all my bones are out of joint my heart is like wax it is melted in the midst of my bowels
my strength is dried up like a potsherd and my tongue cleaveth to my jaws and thou hast brought me into the dust of death
for dogs have compassed me the assembly of the wicked have inclosed me they pierced my hands and my feet
i may tell all my bones they look and stare upon me
they part my garments among them and cast lots upon my vesture
but be not thou far from me o lord o my strength haste thee to help me
deliver my soul from the sword my darling from the power of the dog
save me from the lion's mouth for thou hast heard me from the horns of the unicorns
i will declare thy name unto my brethren in the midst of the congregation will i praise thee
ye that fear the lord praise him all ye the seed of jacob glorify him and fear him all ye the seed of israel
for he hath not despised nor abhorred the affliction of the afflicted neither hath he hid his face from him but when he cried unto him he heard
my praise shall be of thee in the great congregation i will pay my vows before them that fear him
the meek shall eat and be satisfied they shall praise the lord that seek him your heart shall live for ever
all the ends of the world shall remember and turn unto the lord and all the kindreds of the nations shall worship before thee
for the kingdom is the lord's and he is the governor among the nations
all they that be fat upon earth shall eat and worship all they that go down to the dust shall bow before him and none can keep alive his own soul
a seed shall serve him it shall be accounted to the lord for a generation
they shall come and shall declare his righteousness unto a people that shall be born that he hath done this
the lord is my shepherd i shall not want
he maketh me to lie down in green pastures he leadeth me beside the still waters
he restoreth my soul he leadeth me in the paths of righteousness for his name's sake
yea though i walk through the valley of the shadow of death i will fear no evil for thou art with me thy rod and thy staff they comfort me
thou preparest a table before me in the presence of mine enemies thou anointest my head with oil my cup runneth over
surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life and i will dwell in the house of the lord for ever
the earth is the lord's and the fulness thereof the world and they that dwell therein
for he hath founded it upon the seas and established it upon the floods
who shall ascend into the hill of the lord or who shall stand in his holy place
he that hath clean hands and a pure heart who hath not lifted up his soul unto vanity nor sworn deceitfully
he shall receive the blessing from the lord and righteousness from the god of his salvation
this is the generation of them that seek him that seek thy face o jacob selah
lift up your heads o ye gates and be ye lift up ye everlasting doors and the king of glory shall come in
who is this king of glory the lord strong and mighty the lord mighty in battle
lift up your heads o ye gates even lift them up ye everlasting doors and the king of glory shall come in
who is this king of glory the lord of hosts he is the king of glory selah
unto thee o lord do i lift up my soul
o my god i trust in thee let me not be ashamed let not mine enemies triumph over me
yea let none that wait on thee be ashamed let them be ashamed which transgress without cause
shew me thy ways o lord teach me thy paths
lead me in thy truth and teach me for thou art the god of my salvation on thee do i wait all the day
remember o lord thy tender mercies and thy lovingkindnesses for they have been ever of old
remember not the sins of my youth nor my transgressions according to thy mercy remember thou me for thy goodness sake o lord
good and upright is the lord therefore will he teach sinners in the way
the meek will he guide in judgment and the meek will he teach his way
all the paths of the lord are mercy and truth unto such as keep his covenant and his testimonies
for thy name's sake o lord pardon mine iniquity for it is great
what man is he that feareth the lord him shall he teach in the way that he shall choose
his soul shall dwell at ease and his seed shall inherit the earth
the secret of the lord is with them that fear him and he will shew them his covenant
mine eyes are ever toward the lord for he shall pluck my feet out of the net
turn thee unto me and have mercy upon me for i am desolate and afflicted
the troubles of my heart are enlarged o bring thou me out of my distresses
look upon mine affliction and my pain and forgive all my sins
consider mine enemies for they are many and they hate me with cruel hatred
o keep my soul and deliver me let me not be ashamed for i put my trust in thee
let integrity and uprightness preserve me for i wait on thee
redeem israel o god out of all his troubles
judge me o lord for i have walked in mine integrity i have trusted also in the lord therefore i shall not slide
examine me o lord and prove me try my reins and my heart
for thy lovingkindness is before mine eyes and i have walked in thy truth
i have not sat with vain persons neither will i go in with dissemblers
i have hated the congregation of evil doers and will not sit with the wicked
i will wash mine hands in innocency so will i compass thine altar o lord
that i may publish with the voice of thanksgiving and tell of all thy wondrous works
lord i have loved the habitation of thy house and the place where thine honour dwelleth
gather not my soul with sinners nor my life with bloody men
in whose hands is mischief and their right hand is full of bribes
but as for me i will walk in mine integrity redeem me and be merciful unto me
my foot standeth in an even place in the congregations will i bless the lord
the lord is my light and my salvation whom shall i fear the lord is the strength of my life of whom shall i be afraid
when the wicked even mine enemies and my foes came upon me to eat up my flesh they stumbled and fell
though an host should encamp against me my heart shall not fear though war should rise against me in this will i be confident
one thing have i desired of the lord that will i seek after that i may dwell in the house of the lord all the days of my life to behold the beauty of the lord and to enquire in his temple
for in the time of trouble he shall hide me in his pavilion in the secret of his tabernacle shall he hide me he shall set me up upon a rock
and now shall mine head be lifted up above mine enemies round about me therefore will i offer in his tabernacle sacrifices of joy i will sing yea i will sing praises unto the lord
hear o lord when i cry with my voice have mercy also upon me and answer me
when thou saidst seek ye my face my heart said unto thee thy face lord will i seek
hide not thy face far from me put not thy servant away in anger thou hast been my help leave me not neither forsake me o god of my salvation
when my father and my mother forsake me then the lord will take me up
teach me thy way o lord and lead me in a plain path because of mine enemies
deliver me not over unto the will of mine enemies for false witnesses are risen up against me and such as breathe out cruelty
i had fainted unless i had believed to see the goodness of the lord in the land of the living
wait on the lord be of good courage and he shall strengthen thine heart wait i say on the lord
unto thee will i cry o lord my rock be not silent to me lest if thou be silent to me i become like them that go down into the pit
hear the voice of my supplications when i cry unto thee when i lift up my hands toward thy holy oracle
draw me not away with the wicked and with the workers of iniquity which speak peace to their neighbours but mischief is in their hearts
give them according to their deeds and according to the wickedness of their endeavours give them after the work of their hands render to them their desert
because they regard not the works of the lord nor the operation of his hands he shall destroy them and not build them up
blessed be the lord because he hath heard the voice of my supplications
the lord is my strength and my shield my heart trusted in him and i am helped therefore my heart greatly rejoiceth and with my song will i praise him
the lord is their strength and he is the saving strength of his anointed

give unto the lord o ye mighty give unto the lord glory and strength
give unto the lord the glory due unto his name worship the lord in the beauty of holiness

the voice of the lord breaketh the cedars yea the lord breaketh the cedars of lebanon
he maketh them also to skip like a calf lebanon and sirion like a young unicorn
the voice of the lord divideth the flames of fire
the voice of the lord shaketh the wilderness the lord shaketh the wilderness of kadesh
the voice of the lord maketh the hinds to calve and discovereth the forests and in his temple doth every one speak of his glory
the lord sitteth upon the flood yea the lord sitteth king for ever
the lord will give strength unto his people the lord will bless his people with peace
i will extol thee o lord for thou hast lifted me up and hast not made my foes to rejoice over me
o lord my god i cried unto thee and thou hast healed me
o lord thou hast brought up my soul from the grave thou hast kept me alive that i should not go down to the pit
sing unto the lord o ye saints of his and give thanks at the remembrance of his holiness
for his anger endureth but a moment in his favour is life weeping may endure for a night but joy cometh in the morning
and in my prosperity i said i shall never be moved
lord by thy favour thou hast made my mountain to stand strong thou didst hide thy face and i was troubled
i cried to thee o lord and unto the lord i made supplication
what profit is there in my blood when i go down to the pit shall the dust praise thee shall it declare thy truth
hear o lord and have mercy upon me lord be thou my helper
thou hast turned for me my mourning into dancing thou hast put off my sackcloth and girded me with gladness
to the end that my glory may sing praise to thee and not be silent o lord my god i will give thanks unto thee for ever
in thee o lord do i put my trust let me never be ashamed deliver me in thy righteousness
bow down thine ear to me deliver me speedily be thou my strong rock for an house of defence to save me
for thou art my rock and my fortress therefore for thy name's sake lead me and guide me
pull me out of the net that they have laid privily for me for thou art my strength
into thine hand i commit my spirit thou hast redeemed me o lord god of truth
i have hated them that regard lying vanities but i trust in the lord
i will be glad and rejoice in thy mercy for thou hast considered my trouble thou hast known my soul in adversities
and hast not shut me up into the hand of the enemy thou hast set my feet in a large room
have mercy upon me o lord for i am in trouble mine eye is consumed with grief yea my soul and my belly
for my life is spent with grief and my years with sighing my strength faileth because of mine iniquity and my bones are consumed
i was a reproach among all mine enemies but especially among my neighbours and a fear to mine acquaintance they that did see me without fled from me
i am forgotten as a dead man out of mind i am like a broken vessel
for i have heard the slander of many fear was on every side while they took counsel together against me they devised to take away my life
but i trusted in thee o lord i said thou art my god
my times are in thy hand deliver me from the hand of mine enemies and from them that persecute me
make thy face to shine upon thy servant save me for thy mercies sake
let me not be ashamed o lord for i have called upon thee let the wicked be ashamed and let them be silent in the grave
let the lying lips be put to silence which speak grievous things proudly and contemptuously against the righteous
oh how great is thy goodness which thou hast laid up for them that fear thee which thou hast wrought for them that trust in thee before the sons of men
thou shalt hide them in the secret of thy presence from the pride of man thou shalt keep them secretly in a pavilion from the strife of tongues
blessed be the lord for he hath shewed me his marvellous kindness in a strong city
for i said in my haste i am cut off from before thine eyes nevertheless thou heardest the voice of my supplications when i cried unto thee
o love the lord all ye his saints for the lord preserveth the faithful and plentifully rewardeth the proud doer
be of good courage and he shall strengthen your heart all ye that hope in the lord
blessed is he whose transgression is forgiven whose sin is covered
blessed is the man unto whom the lord imputeth not iniquity and in whose spirit there is no guile
when i kept silence my bones waxed old through my roaring all the day long
for day and night thy hand was heavy upon me my moisture is turned into the drought of summer selah
i acknowledged my sin unto thee and mine iniquity have i not hid i said i will confess my transgressions unto the lord and thou forgavest the iniquity of my sin selah
for this shall every one that is godly pray unto thee in a time when thou mayest be found surely in the floods of great waters they shall not come nigh unto him
thou art my hiding place thou shalt preserve me from trouble thou shalt compass me about with songs of deliverance selah
i will instruct thee and teach thee in the way which thou shalt go i will guide thee with mine eye
be ye not as the horse or as the mule which have no understanding whose mouth must be held in with bit and bridle lest they come near unto thee
many sorrows shall be to the wicked but he that trusteth in the lord mercy shall compass him about
be glad in the lord and rejoice ye righteous and shout for joy all ye that are upright in heart
rejoice in the lord o ye righteous for praise is comely for the upright
praise the lord with harp sing unto him with the psaltery and an instrument of ten strings
sing unto him a new song play skilfully with a loud noise
for the word of the lord is right and all his works are done in truth
he loveth righteousness and judgment the earth is full of the goodness of the lord
by the word of the lord were the heavens made and all the host of them by the breath of his mouth
he gathereth the waters of the sea together as an heap he layeth up the depth in storehouses
let all the earth fear the lord let all the inhabitants of the world stand in awe of him
for he spake and it was done he commanded and it stood fast

the lord looketh from heaven he beholdeth all the sons of men
from the place of his habitation he looketh upon all the inhabitants of the earth
he fashioneth their hearts alike he considereth all their works
there is no king saved by the multitude of an host a mighty man is not delivered by much strength
an horse is a vain thing for safety neither shall he deliver any by his great strength
behold the eye of the lord is upon them that fear him upon them that hope in his mercy
to deliver their soul from death and to keep them alive in famine
our soul waiteth for the lord he is our help and our shield
for our heart shall rejoice in him because we have trusted in his holy name
let thy mercy o lord be upon us according as we hope in thee
i will bless the lord at all times his praise shall continually be in my mouth
my soul shall make her boast in the lord the humble shall hear thereof and be glad
o magnify the lord with me and let us exalt his name together
i sought the lord and he heard me and delivered me from all my fears
they looked unto him and were lightened and their faces were not ashamed
this poor man cried and the lord heard him and saved him out of all his troubles
the angel of the lord encampeth round about them that fear him and delivereth them
o taste and see that the lord is good blessed is the man that trusteth in him
o fear the lord ye his saints for there is no want to them that fear him
