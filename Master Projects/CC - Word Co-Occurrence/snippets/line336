knit poisonous clouds about his golden head
'with rotten damps ravish the morning air
let their exhaled unwholesome breaths make sick
the life of purity the supreme fair
ere he arrive his weary noontide prick
and let thy misty vapours march so thick
that in their smoky ranks his smother'd light
may set at noon and make perpetual night
'were tarquin night as he is but night's child
the silvershining queen he would distain
her twinkling handmaids too by him defiled
through night's black bosom should not peep again
so should i have copartners in my pain
and fellowship in woe doth woe assuage
as palmers chat makes short their pilgrimage
'where now i have no one to blush with me
to cross their arms and hang their heads with mine
to mask their brows and hide their infamy
but i alone alone must sit and pine
seasoning the earth with showers of silver brine
mingling my talk with tears my grief with groans
poor wasting monuments of lasting moans
'o night thou furnace of foulreeking smoke
let not the jealous day behold that face
which underneath thy black allhiding cloak
immodestly lies martyr'd with disgrace
keep still possession of thy gloomy place
that all the faults which in thy reign are made
may likewise be sepulchred in thy shade
'make me not object to the telltale day
the light will show character'd in my brow
the story of sweet chastity's decay
the impious breach of holy wedlock vow
yea the illiterate that know not how
to cipher what is writ in learned books
will quote my loathsome trespass in my looks
'the nurse to still her child will tell my story
and fright her crying babe with tarquin's name
the orator to deck his oratory
will couple my reproach to tarquin's shame
feastfinding minstrels tuning my defame
will tie the hearers to attend each line
how tarquin wronged me i collatine
'let my good name that senseless reputation
for collatine's dear love be kept unspotted
if that be made a theme for disputation
the branches of another root are rotted
and undeserved reproach to him allotted
that is as clear from this attaint of mine
as i ere this was pure to collatine
'o unseen shame invisible disgrace
o unfelt sore crestwounding private scar
reproach is stamp'd in collatinus face
and tarquin's eye may read the mot afar
how he in peace is wounded not in war
alas how many bear such shameful blows
which not themselves but he that gives them knows
'if collatine thine honour lay in me
from me by strong assault it is bereft
my honour lost and i a dronelike bee
have no perfection of my summer left
but robb'd and ransack'd by injurious theft
in thy weak hive a wandering wasp hath crept
and suck'd the honey which thy chaste bee kept
'yet am i guilty of thy honour's wrack
yet for thy honour did i entertain him
coming from thee i could not put him back
for it had been dishonour to disdain him
besides of weariness he did complain him
and talk'd of virtue o unlook'dfor evil
when virtue is profaned in such a devil
'why should the worm intrude the maiden bud
or hateful cuckoos hatch in sparrows nests
or toads infect fair founts with venom mud
or tyrant folly lurk in gentle breasts
or kings be breakers of their own behests
but no perfection is so absolute
that some impurity doth not pollute
'the aged man that coffersup his gold
is plagued with cramps and gouts and painful fits
and scarce hath eyes his treasure to behold
but like stillpining tantalus he sits
and useless barns the harvest of his wits
having no other pleasure of his gain
but torment that it cannot cure his pain
'so then he hath it when he cannot use it
and leaves it to be master'd by his young
who in their pride do presently abuse it
their father was too weak and they too strong
to hold their cursedblessed fortune long
the sweets we wish for turn to loathed sours
even in the moment that we call them ours
'unruly blasts wait on the tender spring
unwholesome weeds take root with precious flowers
the adder hisses where the sweet birds sing
what virtue breeds iniquity devours
we have no good that we can say is ours
but illannexed opportunity
or kills his life or else his quality
'o opportunity thy guilt is great
'tis thou that executest the traitor's treason
thou set'st the wolf where he the lamb may get
whoever plots the sin thou point'st the season
'tis thou that spurn'st at right at law at reason
and in thy shady cell where none may spy him
sits sin to seize the souls that wander by him
'thou makest the vestal violate her oath
thou blow'st the fire when temperance is thaw'd
thou smother'st honesty thou murder'st troth
thou foul abettor thou notorious bawd
thou plantest scandal and displacest laud
thou ravisher thou traitor thou false thief
thy honey turns to gall thy joy to grief
'thy secret pleasure turns to open shame
thy private feasting to a public fast
thy smoothing titles to a ragged name
thy sugar'd tongue to bitter wormwood taste
thy violent vanities can never last
how comes it then vile opportunity
being so bad such numbers seek for thee
'when wilt thou be the humble suppliant's friend
and bring him where his suit may be obtain'd
when wilt thou sort an hour great strifes to end
or free that soul which wretchedness hath chain'd
give physic to the sick ease to the pain'd
the poor lame blind halt creep cry out for thee
but they ne'er meet with opportunity
'the patient dies while the physician sleeps
the orphan pines while the oppressor feeds
justice is feasting while the widow weeps
advice is sporting while infection breeds
thou grant'st no time for charitable deeds
wrath envy treason rape and murder's rages
thy heinous hours wait on them as their pages
'when truth and virtue have to do with thee
a thousand crosses keep them from thy aid
they buy thy help but sin ne'er gives a fee
he gratis comes and thou art well appaid
as well to hear as grant what he hath said
my collatine would else have come to me
when tarquin did but he was stay'd by thee
guilty thou art of murder and of theft
guilty of perjury and subornation
guilty of treason forgery and shift
guilty of incest that abomination
an accessary by thine inclination
to all sins past and all that are to come
from the creation to the general doom
'misshapen time copesmate of ugly night
swift subtle post carrier of grisly care
eater of youth false slave to false delight
base watch of woes sin's packhorse virtue's snare
thou nursest all and murder'st all that are
o hear me then injurious shifting time
be guilty of my death since of my crime
'why hath thy servant opportunity
betray'd the hours thou gavest me to repose
cancell'd my fortunes and enchained me
to endless date of neverending woes
time's office is to fine the hate of foes
to eat up errors by opinion bred
not spend the dowry of a lawful bed
'time's glory is to calm contending kings
to unmask falsehood and bring truth to light
to stamp the seal of time in aged things
to wake the morn and sentinel the night
to wrong the wronger till he render right
to ruinate proud buildings with thy hours
and smear with dust their glittering golden towers
'to fill with wormholes stately monuments
to feed oblivion with decay of things
to blot old books and alter their contents
to pluck the quills from ancient ravens wings
to dry the old oak's sap and cherish springs
to spoil antiquities of hammer'd steel
and turn the giddy round of fortune's wheel
'to show the beldam daughters of her daughter
to make the child a man the man a child
to slay the tiger that doth live by slaughter
to tame the unicorn and lion wild
to mock the subtle in themselves beguiled
to cheer the ploughman with increaseful crops
and waste huge stones with little water drops
'why work'st thou mischief in thy pilgrimage
unless thou couldst return to make amends
one poor retiring minute in an age
would purchase thee a thousand thousand friends
lending him wit that to bad debtors lends
o this dread night wouldst thou one hour come back
i could prevent this storm and shun thy wrack
'thou ceaseless lackey to eternity
with some mischance cross tarquin in his flight
devise extremes beyond extremity
to make him curse this cursed crimeful night
let ghastly shadows his lewd eyes affright
and the dire thought of his committed evil
shape every bush a hideous shapeless devil
'disturb his hours of rest with restless trances
afflict him in his bed with bedrid groans
let there bechance him pitiful mischances
