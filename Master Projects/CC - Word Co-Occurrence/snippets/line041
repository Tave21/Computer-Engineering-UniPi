2sm718 then went king david in and sat before the lord and he said who am i o lord god and what is my house that thou hast brought me hitherto
2sm719 and this was yet a small thing in thy sight o lord god but thou hast spoken also of thy servant's house for a great while to come and is this the manner of man o lord god
2sm720 and what can david say more unto thee for thou lord god knowest thy servant
2sm721 for thy word's sake and according to thine own heart hast thou done all these great things to make thy servant know them
2sm722 wherefore thou art great o lord god for there is none like thee neither is there any god beside thee according to all that we have heard with our ears
2sm723 and what one nation in the earth is like thy people even like israel whom god went to redeem for a people to himself and to make him a name and to do for you great things and terrible for thy land before thy people which thou redeemedst to thee from egypt from the nations and their gods
2sm724 for thou hast confirmed to thyself thy people israel to be a people unto thee for ever and thou lord art become their god
2sm725 and now o lord god the word that thou hast spoken concerning thy servant and concerning his house establish it for ever and do as thou hast said
2sm726 and let thy name be magnified for ever saying the lord of hosts is the god over israel and let the house of thy servant david be established before thee
2sm727 for thou o lord of hosts god of israel hast revealed to thy servant saying i will build thee an house therefore hath thy servant found in his heart to pray this prayer unto thee
2sm728 and now o lord god thou art that god and thy words be true and thou hast promised this goodness unto thy servant
2sm729 therefore now let it please thee to bless the house of thy servant that it may continue for ever before thee for thou o lord god hast spoken it and with thy blessing let the house of thy servant be blessed for ever
2sm81 and after this it came to pass that david smote the philistines and subdued them and david took methegammah out of the hand of the philistines
2sm82 and he smote moab and measured them with a line casting them down to the ground even with two lines measured he to put to death and with one full line to keep alive and so the moabites became david's servants and brought gifts
2sm83 david smote also hadadezer the son of rehob king of zobah as he went to recover his border at the river euphrates
2sm84 and david took from him a thousand chariots and seven hundred horsemen and twenty thousand footmen and david houghed all the chariot horses but reserved of them for an hundred chariots
2sm85 and when the syrians of damascus came to succour hadadezer king of zobah david slew of the syrians two and twenty thousand men
2sm86 then david put garrisons in syria of damascus and the syrians became servants to david and brought gifts and the lord preserved david whithersoever he went
2sm87 and david took the shields of gold that were on the servants of hadadezer and brought them to jerusalem
2sm88 and from betah and from berothai cities of hadadezer king david took exceeding much brass
2sm89 when toi king of hamath heard that david had smitten all the host of hadadezer
2sm810 then toi sent joram his son unto king david to salute him and to bless him because he had fought against hadadezer and smitten him for hadadezer had wars with toi and joram brought with him vessels of silver and vessels of gold and vessels of brass
2sm811 which also king david did dedicate unto the lord with the silver and gold that he had dedicated of all nations which he subdued
2sm812 of syria and of moab and of the children of ammon and of the philistines and of amalek and of the spoil of hadadezer son of rehob king of zobah
2sm813 and david gat him a name when he returned from smiting of the syrians in the valley of salt being eighteen thousand men
2sm814 and he put garrisons in edom throughout all edom put he garrisons and all they of edom became david's servants and the lord preserved david whithersoever he went
2sm815 and david reigned over all israel and david executed judgment and justice unto all his people
2sm816 and joab the son of zeruiah was over the host and jehoshaphat the son of ahilud was recorder
2sm817 and zadok the son of ahitub and ahimelech the son of abiathar were the priests and seraiah was the scribe
2sm818 and benaiah the son of jehoiada was over both the cherethites and the pelethites and david's sons were chief rulers
2sm91 and david said is there yet any that is left of the house of saul that i may shew him kindness for jonathan's sake
2sm92 and there was of the house of saul a servant whose name was ziba and when they had called him unto david the king said unto him art thou ziba and he said thy servant is he
2sm93 and the king said is there not yet any of the house of saul that i may shew the kindness of god unto him and ziba said unto the king jonathan hath yet a son which is lame on his feet
2sm94 and the king said unto him where is he and ziba said unto the king behold he is in the house of machir the son of ammiel in lodebar
2sm95 then king david sent and fetched him out of the house of machir the son of ammiel from lodebar
2sm96 now when mephibosheth the son of jonathan the son of saul was come unto david he fell on his face and did reverence and david said mephibosheth and he answered behold thy servant
2sm97 and david said unto him fear not for i will surely shew thee kindness for jonathan thy father's sake and will restore thee all the land of saul thy father and thou shalt eat bread at my table continually
2sm98 and he bowed himself and said what is thy servant that thou shouldest look upon such a dead dog as i am
2sm99 then the king called to ziba saul's servant and said unto him i have given unto thy master's son all that pertained to saul and to all his house
2sm910 thou therefore and thy sons and thy servants shall till the land for him and thou shalt bring in the fruits that thy master's son may have food to eat but mephibosheth thy master's son shall eat bread alway at my table now ziba had fifteen sons and twenty servants
2sm911 then said ziba unto the king according to all that my lord the king hath commanded his servant so shall thy servant do as for mephibosheth said the king he shall eat at my table as one of the king's sons
2sm912 and mephibosheth had a young son whose name was micha and all that dwelt in the house of ziba were servants unto mephibosheth
2sm913 so mephibosheth dwelt in jerusalem for he did eat continually at the king's table and was lame on both his feet
2sm101 and it came to pass after this that the king of the children of ammon died and hanun his son reigned in his stead
2sm102 then said david i will shew kindness unto hanun the son of nahash as his father shewed kindness unto me and david sent to comfort him by the hand of his servants for his father and david's servants came into the land of the children of ammon
2sm103 and the princes of the children of ammon said unto hanun their lord thinkest thou that david doth honour thy father that he hath sent comforters unto thee hath not david rather sent his servants unto thee to search the city and to spy it out and to overthrow it
2sm104 wherefore hanun took david's servants and shaved off the one half of their beards and cut off their garments in the middle even to their buttocks and sent them away
2sm105 when they told it unto david he sent to meet them because the men were greatly ashamed and the king said tarry at jericho until your beards be grown and then return
2sm106 and when the children of ammon saw that they stank before david the children of ammon sent and hired the syrians of bethrehob and the syrians of zoba twenty thousand footmen and of king maacah a thousand men and of ishtob twelve thousand men
2sm107 and when david heard of it he sent joab and all the host of the mighty men
2sm108 and the children of ammon came out and put the battle in array at the entering in of the gate and the syrians of zoba and of rehob and ishtob and maacah were by themselves in the field
2sm109 when joab saw that the front of the battle was against him before and behind he chose of all the choice men of israel and put them in array against the syrians
2sm1010 and the rest of the people he delivered into the hand of abishai his brother that he might put them in array against the children of ammon
2sm1011 and he said if the syrians be too strong for me then thou shalt help me but if the children of ammon be too strong for thee then i will come and help thee
2sm1012 be of good courage and let us play the men for our people and for the cities of our god and the lord do that which seemeth him good
2sm1013 and joab drew nigh and the people that were with him unto the battle against the syrians and they fled before him
2sm1014 and when the children of ammon saw that the syrians were fled then fled they also before abishai and entered into the city so joab returned from the children of ammon and came to jerusalem
2sm1015 and when the syrians saw that they were smitten before israel they gathered themselves together
2sm1016 and hadarezer sent and brought out the syrians that were beyond the river and they came to helam and shobach the captain of the host of hadarezer went before them
2sm1017 and when it was told david he gathered all israel together and passed over jordan and came to helam and the syrians set themselves in array against david and fought with him
2sm1018 and the syrians fled before israel and david slew the men of seven hundred chariots of the syrians and forty thousand horsemen and smote shobach the captain of their host who died there
2sm1019 and when all the kings that were servants to hadarezer saw that they were smitten before israel they made peace with israel and served them so the syrians feared to help the children of ammon any more
2sm111 and it came to pass after the year was expired at the time when kings go forth to battle that david sent joab and his servants with him and all israel and they destroyed the children of ammon and besieged rabbah but david tarried still at jerusalem
2sm112 and it came to pass in an eveningtide that david arose from off his bed and walked upon the roof of the king's house and from the roof he saw a woman washing herself and the woman was very beautiful to look upon
2sm113 and david sent and enquired after the woman and one said is not this bathsheba the daughter of eliam the wife of uriah the hittite
2sm114 and david sent messengers and took her and she came in unto him and he lay with her for she was purified from her uncleanness and she returned unto her house
2sm115 and the woman conceived and sent and told david and said i am with child
2sm116 and david sent to joab saying send me uriah the hittite and joab sent uriah to david
2sm117 and when uriah was come unto him david demanded of him how joab did and how the people did and how the war prospered
2sm118 and david said to uriah go down to thy house and wash thy feet and uriah departed out of the king's house and there followed him a mess of meat from the king
2sm119 but uriah slept at the door of the king's house with all the servants of his lord and went not down to his house
2sm1110 and when they had told david saying uriah went not down unto his house david said unto uriah camest thou not from thy journey why then didst thou not go down unto thine house
2sm1111 and uriah said unto david the ark and israel and judah abide in tents and my lord joab and the servants of my lord are encamped in the open fields shall i then go into mine house to eat and to drink and to lie with my wife as thou livest and as thy soul liveth i will not do this thing
2sm1112 and david said to uriah tarry here to day also and to morrow i will let thee depart so uriah abode in jerusalem that day and the morrow
2sm1113 and when david had called him he did eat and drink before him and he made him drunk and at even he went out to lie on his bed with the servants of his lord but went not down to his house
2sm1114 and it came to pass in the morning that david wrote a letter to joab and sent it by the hand of uriah
2sm1115 and he wrote in the letter saying set ye uriah in the forefront of the hottest battle and retire ye from him that he may be smitten and die
2sm1116 and it came to pass when joab observed the city that he assigned uriah unto a place where he knew that valiant men were
2sm1117 and the men of the city went out and fought with joab and there fell some of the people of the servants of david and uriah the hittite died also
2sm1118 then joab sent and told david all the things concerning the war
2sm1119 and charged the messenger saying when thou hast made an end of telling the matters of the war unto the king
2sm1120 and if so be that the king's wrath arise and he say unto thee wherefore approached ye so nigh unto the city when ye did fight knew ye not that they would shoot from the wall
2sm1121 who smote abimelech the son of jerubbesheth did not a woman cast a piece of a millstone upon him from the wall that he died in thebez why went ye nigh the wall then say thou thy servant uriah the hittite is dead also
2sm1122 so the messenger went and came and shewed david all that joab had sent him for
2sm1123 and the messenger said unto david surely the men prevailed against us and came out unto us into the field and we were upon them even unto the entering of the gate
2sm1124 and the shooters shot from off the wall upon thy servants and some of the king's servants be dead and thy servant uriah the hittite is dead also
2sm1125 then david said unto the messenger thus shalt thou say unto joab let not this thing displease thee for the sword devoureth one as well as another make thy battle more strong against the city and overthrow it and encourage thou him
2sm1126 and when the wife of uriah heard that uriah her husband was dead she mourned for her husband
2sm1127 and when the mourning was past david sent and fetched her to his house and she became his wife and bare him a son but the thing that david had done displeased the lord
2sm121 and the lord sent nathan unto david and he came unto him and said unto him there were two men in one city the one rich and the other poor
2sm122 the rich man had exceeding many flocks and herds
2sm123 but the poor man had nothing save one little ewe lamb which he had bought and nourished up and it grew up together with him and with his children it did eat of his own meat and drank of his own cup and lay in his bosom and was unto him as a daughter
2sm124 and there came a traveller unto the rich man and he spared to take of his own flock and of his own herd to dress for the wayfaring man that was come unto him but took the poor man's lamb and dressed it for the man that was come to him
2sm125 and david's anger was greatly kindled against the man and he said to nathan as the lord liveth the man that hath done this thing shall surely die
2sm126 and he shall restore the lamb fourfold because he did this thing and because he had no pity
2sm127 and nathan said to david thou art the man thus saith the lord god of israel i anointed thee king over israel and i delivered thee out of the hand of saul
2sm128 and i gave thee thy master's house and thy master's wives into thy bosom and gave thee the house of israel and of judah and if that had been too little i would moreover have given unto thee such and such things
2sm129 wherefore hast thou despised the commandment of the lord to do evil in his sight thou hast killed uriah the hittite with the sword and hast taken his wife to be thy wife and hast slain him with the sword of the children of ammon
2sm1210 now therefore the sword shall never depart from thine house because thou hast despised me and hast taken the wife of uriah the hittite to be thy wife
2sm1211 thus saith the lord behold i will raise up evil against thee out of thine own house and i will take thy wives before thine eyes and give them unto thy neighbour and he shall lie with thy wives in the sight of this sun
2sm1212 for thou didst it secretly but i will do this thing before all israel and before the sun
2sm1213 and david said unto nathan i have sinned against the lord and nathan said unto david the lord also hath put away thy sin thou shalt not die
2sm1214 howbeit because by this deed thou hast given great occasion to the enemies of the lord to blaspheme the child also that is born unto thee shall surely die
2sm1215 and nathan departed unto his house and the lord struck the child that uriah's wife bare unto david and it was very sick
2sm1216 david therefore besought god for the child and david fasted and went in and lay all night upon the earth
2sm1217 and the elders of his house arose and went to him to raise him up from the earth but he would not neither did he eat bread with them
2sm1218 and it came to pass on the seventh day that the child died and the servants of david feared to tell him that the child was dead for they said behold while the child was yet alive we spake unto him and he would not hearken unto our voice how will he then vex himself if we tell him that the child is dead
2sm1219 but when david saw that his servants whispered david perceived that the child was dead therefore david said unto his servants is the child dead and they said he is dead
2sm1220 then david arose from the earth and washed and anointed himself and changed his apparel and came into the house of the lord and worshipped then he came to his own house and when he required they set bread before him and he did eat
2sm1221 then said his servants unto him what thing is this that thou hast done thou didst fast and weep for the child while it was alive but when the child was dead thou didst rise and eat bread
2sm1222 and he said while the child was yet alive i fasted and wept for i said who can tell whether god will be gracious to me that the child may live
2sm1223 but now he is dead wherefore should i fast can i bring him back again i shall go to him but he shall not return to me
2sm1224 and david comforted bathsheba his wife and went in unto her and lay with her and she bare a son and he called his name solomon and the lord loved him
2sm1225 and he sent by the hand of nathan the prophet and he called his name jedidiah because of the lord
2sm1226 and joab fought against rabbah of the children of ammon and took the royal city
2sm1227 and joab sent messengers to david and said i have fought against rabbah and have taken the city of waters
2sm1228 now therefore gather the rest of the people together and encamp against the city and take it lest i take the city and it be called after my name
2sm1229 and david gathered all the people together and went to rabbah and fought against it and took it
2sm1230 and he took their king's crown from off his head the weight whereof was a talent of gold with the precious stones and it was set on david's head and he brought forth the spoil of the city in great abundance
2sm1231 and he brought forth the people that were therein and put them under saws and under harrows of iron and under axes of iron and made them pass through the brickkiln and thus did he unto all the cities of the children of ammon so david and all the people returned unto jerusalem
2sm131 and it came to pass after this that absalom the son of david had a fair sister whose name was tamar and amnon the son of david loved her
2sm132 and amnon was so vexed that he fell sick for his sister tamar for she was a virgin and amnon thought it hard for him to do anything to her
2sm133 but amnon had a friend whose name was jonadab the son of shimeah david's brother and jonadab was a very subtil man
2sm134 and he said unto him why art thou being the king's son lean from day to day wilt thou not tell me and amnon said unto him i love tamar my brother absalom's sister
2sm135 and jonadab said unto him lay thee down on thy bed and make thyself sick and when thy father cometh to see thee say unto him i pray thee let my sister tamar come and give me meat and dress the meat in my sight that i may see it and eat it at her hand
2sm136 so amnon lay down and made himself sick and when the king was come to see him amnon said unto the king i pray thee let tamar my sister come and make me a couple of cakes in my sight that i may eat at her hand
2sm137 then david sent home to tamar saying go now to thy brother amnon's house and dress him meat
2sm138 so tamar went to her brother amnon's house and he was laid down and she took flour and kneaded it and made cakes in his sight and did bake the cakes
2sm139 and she took a pan and poured them out before him but he refused to eat and amnon said have out all men from me and they went out every man from him
2sm1310 and amnon said unto tamar bring the meat into the chamber that i may eat of thine hand and tamar took the cakes which she had made and brought them into the chamber to amnon her brother
2sm1311 and when she had brought them unto him to eat he took hold of her and said unto her come lie with me my sister
2sm1312 and she answered him nay my brother do not force me for no such thing ought to be done in israel do not thou this folly
2sm1313 and i whither shall i cause my shame to go and as for thee thou shalt be as one of the fools in israel now therefore i pray thee speak unto the king for he will not withhold me from thee
2sm1314 howbeit he would not hearken unto her voice but being stronger than she forced her and lay with her
2sm1315 then amnon hated her exceedingly so that the hatred wherewith he hated her was greater than the love wherewith he had loved her and amnon said unto her arise be gone
2sm1316 and she said unto him there is no cause this evil in sending me away is greater than the other that thou didst unto me but he would not hearken unto her
2sm1317 then he called his servant that ministered unto him and said put now this woman out from me and bolt the door after her
2sm1318 and she had a garment of divers colours upon her for with such robes were the king's daughters that were virgins apparelled then his servant brought her out and bolted the door after her
2sm1319 and tamar put ashes on her head and rent her garment of divers colours that was on her and laid her hand on her head and went on crying
2sm1320 and absalom her brother said unto her hath amnon thy brother been with thee but hold now thy peace my sister he is thy brother regard not this thing so tamar remained desolate in her brother absalom's house
2sm1321 but when king david heard of all these things he was very wroth
2sm1322 and absalom spake unto his brother amnon neither good nor bad for absalom hated amnon because he had forced his sister tamar
2sm1323 and it came to pass after two full years that absalom had sheepshearers in baalhazor which is beside ephraim and absalom invited all the king's sons
2sm1324 and absalom came to the king and said behold now thy servant hath sheepshearers let the king i beseech thee and his servants go with thy servant
2sm1325 and the king said to absalom nay my son let us not all now go lest we be chargeable unto thee and he pressed him howbeit he would not go but blessed him
2sm1326 then said absalom if not i pray thee let my brother amnon go with us and the king said unto him why should he go with thee
2sm1327 but absalom pressed him that he let amnon and all the king's sons go with him
2sm1328 now absalom had commanded his servants saying mark ye now when amnon's heart is merry with wine and when i say unto you smite amnon then kill him fear not have not i commanded you be courageous and be valiant
2sm1329 and the servants of absalom did unto amnon as absalom had commanded then all the king's sons arose and every man gat him up upon his mule and fled
2sm1330 and it came to pass while they were in the way that tidings came to david saying absalom hath slain all the king's sons and there is not one of them left
2sm1331 then the king arose and tare his garments and lay on the earth and all his servants stood by with their clothes rent
2sm1332 and jonadab the son of shimeah david's brother answered and said let not my lord suppose that they have slain all the young men the king's sons for amnon only is dead for by the appointment of absalom this hath been determined from the day that he forced his sister tamar
2sm1333 now therefore let not my lord the king take the thing to his heart to think that all the king's sons are dead for amnon only is dead
2sm1334 but absalom fled and the young man that kept the watch lifted up his eyes and looked and behold there came much people by the way of the hill side behind him
2sm1335 and jonadab said unto the king behold the king's sons come as thy servant said so it is
2sm1336 and it came to pass as soon as he had made an end of speaking that behold the king's sons came and lifted up their voice and wept and the king also and all his servants wept very sore
2sm1337 but absalom fled and went to talmai the son of ammihud king of geshur and david mourned for his son every day
2sm1338 so absalom fled and went to geshur and was there three years
2sm1339 and the soul of king david longed to go forth unto absalom for he was comforted concerning amnon seeing he was dead
2sm141 now joab the son of zeruiah perceived that the king's heart was toward absalom
2sm142 and joab sent to tekoah and fetched thence a wise woman and said unto her i pray thee feign thyself to be a mourner and put on now mourning apparel and anoint not thyself with oil but be as a woman that had a long time mourned for the dead
2sm143 and come to the king and speak on this manner unto him so joab put the words in her mouth
2sm144 and when the woman of tekoah spake to the king she fell on her face to the ground and did obeisance and said help o king
2sm145 and the king said unto her what aileth thee and she answered i am indeed a widow woman and mine husband is dead
2sm146 and thy handmaid had two sons and they two strove together in the field and there was none to part them but the one smote the other and slew him
2sm147 and behold the whole family is risen against thine handmaid and they said deliver him that smote his brother that we may kill him for the life of his brother whom he slew and we will destroy the heir also and so they shall quench my coal which is left and shall not leave to my husband neither name nor remainder upon the earth
2sm148 and the king said unto the woman go to thine house and i will give charge concerning thee
2sm149 and the woman of tekoah said unto the king my lord o king the iniquity be on me and on my father's house and the king and his throne be guiltless
2sm1410 and the king said whosoever saith ought unto thee bring him to me and he shall not touch thee any more
2sm1411 then said she i pray thee let the king remember the lord thy god that thou wouldest not suffer the revengers of blood to destroy any more lest they destroy my son and he said as the lord liveth there shall not one hair of thy son fall to the earth
2sm1412 then the woman said let thine handmaid i pray thee speak one word unto my lord the king and he said say on
2sm1413 and the woman said wherefore then hast thou thought such a thing against the people of god for the king doth speak this thing as one which is faulty in that the king doth not fetch home again his banished
2sm1414 for we must needs die and are as water spilt on the ground which cannot be gathered up again neither doth god respect any person yet doth he devise means that his banished be not expelled from him
2sm1415 now therefore that i am come to speak of this thing unto my lord the king it is because the people have made me afraid and thy handmaid said i will now speak unto the king it may be that the king will perform the request of his handmaid
2sm1416 for the king will hear to deliver his handmaid out of the hand of the man that would destroy me and my son together out of the inheritance of god
2sm1417 then thine handmaid said the word of my lord the king shall now be comfortable for as an angel of god so is my lord the king to discern good and bad therefore the lord thy god will be with thee
2sm1418 then the king answered and said unto the woman hide not from me i pray thee the thing that i shall ask thee and the woman said let my lord the king now speak
2sm1419 and the king said is not the hand of joab with thee in all this and the woman answered and said as thy soul liveth my lord the king none can turn to the right hand or to the left from ought that my lord the king hath spoken for thy servant joab he bade me and he put all these words in the mouth of thine handmaid
2sm1420 to fetch about this form of speech hath thy servant joab done this thing and my lord is wise according to the wisdom of an angel of god to know all things that are in the earth
2sm1421 and the king said unto joab behold now i have done this thing go therefore bring the young man absalom again
2sm1422 and joab fell to the ground on his face and bowed himself and thanked the king and joab said to day thy servant knoweth that i have found grace in thy sight my lord o king in that the king hath fulfilled the request of his servant
2sm1423 so joab arose and went to geshur and brought absalom to jerusalem
2sm1424 and the king said let him turn to his own house and let him not see my face so absalom returned to his own house and saw not the king's face
2sm1425 but in all israel there was none to be so much praised as absalom for his beauty from the sole of his foot even to the crown of his head there was no blemish in him
2sm1426 and when he polled his head for it was at every year's end that he polled it because the hair was heavy on him therefore he polled it he weighed the hair of his head at two hundred shekels after the king's weight
2sm1427 and unto absalom there were born three sons and one daughter whose name was tamar she was a woman of a fair countenance
2sm1428 so absalom dwelt two full years in jerusalem and saw not the king's face
2sm1429 therefore absalom sent for joab to have sent him to the king but he would not come to him and when he sent again the second time he would not come
2sm1430 therefore he said unto his servants see joab's field is near mine and he hath barley there go and set it on fire and absalom's servants set the field on fire
2sm1431 then joab arose and came to absalom unto his house and said unto him wherefore have thy servants set my field on fire
2sm1432 and absalom answered joab behold i sent unto thee saying come hither that i may send thee to the king to say wherefore am i come from geshur it had been good for me to have been there still now therefore let me see the king's face and if there be any iniquity in me let him kill me
2sm1433 so joab came to the king and told him and when he had called for absalom he came to the king and bowed himself on his face to the ground before the king and the king kissed absalom
2sm151 and it came to pass after this that absalom prepared him chariots and horses and fifty men to run before him
2sm152 and absalom rose up early and stood beside the way of the gate and it was so that when any man that had a controversy came to the king for judgment then absalom called unto him and said of what city art thou and he said thy servant is of one of the tribes of israel
2sm153 and absalom said unto him see thy matters are good and right but there is no man deputed of the king to hear thee
2sm154 absalom said moreover oh that i were made judge in the land that every man which hath any suit or cause might come unto me and i would do him justice
2sm155 and it was so that when any man came nigh to him to do him obeisance he put forth his hand and took him and kissed him
2sm156 and on this manner did absalom to all israel that came to the king for judgment so absalom stole the hearts of the men of israel
2sm157 and it came to pass after forty years that absalom said unto the king i pray thee let me go and pay my vow which i have vowed unto the lord in hebron
2sm158 for thy servant vowed a vow while i abode at geshur in syria saying if the lord shall bring me again indeed to jerusalem then i will serve the lord
