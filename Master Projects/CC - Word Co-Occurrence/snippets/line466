act v
scene i belmont avenue to portia's house
 enter lorenzo and jessica
lorenzo the moon shines bright in such a night as this
 when the sweet wind did gently kiss the trees
 and they did make no noise in such a night
 troilus methinks mounted the troyan walls
 and sigh'd his soul toward the grecian tents
 where cressid lay that night
jessica in such a night
 did thisbe fearfully o'ertrip the dew
 and saw the lion's shadow ere himself
 and ran dismay'd away
lorenzo in such a night
 stood dido with a willow in her hand
 upon the wild sea banks and waft her love
 to come again to carthage
jessica in such a night
 medea gather'd the enchanted herbs
 that did renew old aeson
lorenzo in such a night
 did jessica steal from the wealthy jew
 and with an unthrift love did run from venice
 as far as belmont
jessica in such a night
 did young lorenzo swear he loved her well
 stealing her soul with many vows of faith
 and ne'er a true one
lorenzo in such a night
 did pretty jessica like a little shrew
 slander her love and he forgave it her
jessica i would outnight you did no body come
 but hark i hear the footing of a man
 enter stephano
lorenzo who comes so fast in silence of the night
stephano a friend
lorenzo a friend what friend your name i pray you friend
stephano stephano is my name and i bring word
 my mistress will before the break of day
 be here at belmont she doth stray about
 by holy crosses where she kneels and prays
 for happy wedlock hours
lorenzo who comes with her
stephano none but a holy hermit and her maid
 i pray you is my master yet return'd
lorenzo he is not nor we have not heard from him
 but go we in i pray thee jessica
 and ceremoniously let us prepare
 some welcome for the mistress of the house
 enter launcelot
launcelot sola sola wo ha ho sola sola
lorenzo who calls
launcelot sola did you see master lorenzo
 master lorenzo sola sola
lorenzo leave hollaing man here
launcelot sola where where
lorenzo here
launcelot tell him there's a post come from my master with
 his horn full of good news my master will be here
 ere morning
 exit
lorenzo sweet soul let's in and there expect their coming
 and yet no matter why should we go in
 my friend stephano signify i pray you
 within the house your mistress is at hand
 and bring your music forth into the air
 exit stephano
 how sweet the moonlight sleeps upon this bank
 here will we sit and let the sounds of music
 creep in our ears soft stillness and the night
 become the touches of sweet harmony
 sit jessica look how the floor of heaven
 is thick inlaid with patines of bright gold
 there's not the smallest orb which thou behold'st
 but in his motion like an angel sings
 still quiring to the youngeyed cherubins
 such harmony is in immortal souls
 but whilst this muddy vesture of decay
 doth grossly close it in we cannot hear it
 enter musicians
 come ho and wake diana with a hymn
 with sweetest touches pierce your mistress ear
 and draw her home with music
 music
jessica i am never merry when i hear sweet music
lorenzo the reason is your spirits are attentive
 for do but note a wild and wanton herd
 or race of youthful and unhandled colts
 fetching mad bounds bellowing and neighing loud
 which is the hot condition of their blood
 if they but hear perchance a trumpet sound
 or any air of music touch their ears
 you shall perceive them make a mutual stand
 their savage eyes turn'd to a modest gaze
 by the sweet power of music therefore the poet
 did feign that orpheus drew trees stones and floods
 since nought so stockish hard and full of rage
 but music for the time doth change his nature
 the man that hath no music in himself
 nor is not moved with concord of sweet sounds
 is fit for treasons stratagems and spoils
 the motions of his spirit are dull as night
 and his affections dark as erebus
 let no such man be trusted mark the music
 enter portia and nerissa
portia that light we see is burning in my hall
 how far that little candle throws his beams
 so shines a good deed in a naughty world
nerissa when the moon shone we did not see the candle
portia so doth the greater glory dim the less
 a substitute shines brightly as a king
 unto the king be by and then his state
 empties itself as doth an inland brook
 into the main of waters music hark
nerissa it is your music madam of the house
portia nothing is good i see without respect
 methinks it sounds much sweeter than by day
nerissa silence bestows that virtue on it madam
portia the crow doth sing as sweetly as the lark
 when neither is attended and i think
