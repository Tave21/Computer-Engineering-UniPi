 if guilty dread have left thee so much strength
 as to take up mine honour's pawn then stoop
 by that and all the rites of knighthood else
 will i make good against thee arm to arm
 what i have spoke or thou canst worse devise
thomas mowbray i take it up and by that sword i swear
 which gently laid my knighthood on my shoulder
 i'll answer thee in any fair degree
 or chivalrous design of knightly trial
 and when i mount alive may i not light
 if i be traitor or unjustly fight
king richard ii what doth our cousin lay to mowbray's charge
 it must be great that can inherit us
 so much as of a thought of ill in him
henry bolingbroke look what i speak my life shall prove it true
 that mowbray hath received eight thousand nobles
 in name of lendings for your highness soldiers
 the which he hath detain'd for lewd employments
 like a false traitor and injurious villain
 besides i say and will in battle prove
 or here or elsewhere to the furthest verge
 that ever was survey'd by english eye
 that all the treasons for these eighteen years
 complotted and contrived in this land
 fetch from false mowbray their first head and spring
 further i say and further will maintain
 upon his bad life to make all this good
 that he did plot the duke of gloucester's death
 suggest his soonbelieving adversaries
 and consequently like a traitor coward
 sluiced out his innocent soul through streams of blood
 which blood like sacrificing abel's cries
 even from the tongueless caverns of the earth
 to me for justice and rough chastisement
 and by the glorious worth of my descent
 this arm shall do it or this life be spent
king richard ii how high a pitch his resolution soars
 thomas of norfolk what say'st thou to this
thomas mowbray o let my sovereign turn away his face
 and bid his ears a little while be deaf
 till i have told this slander of his blood
 how god and good men hate so foul a liar
king richard ii mowbray impartial are our eyes and ears
 were he my brother nay my kingdom's heir
 as he is but my father's brother's son
 now by my sceptre's awe i make a vow
 such neighbour nearness to our sacred blood
 should nothing privilege him nor partialize
 the unstooping firmness of my upright soul
 he is our subject mowbray so art thou
 free speech and fearless i to thee allow
thomas mowbray then bolingbroke as low as to thy heart
 through the false passage of thy throat thou liest
 three parts of that receipt i had for calais
 disbursed i duly to his highness soldiers
 the other part reserved i by consent
 for that my sovereign liege was in my debt
 upon remainder of a dear account
 since last i went to france to fetch his queen
 now swallow down that lie for gloucester's death
 i slew him not but to my own disgrace
 neglected my sworn duty in that case
 for you my noble lord of lancaster
 the honourable father to my foe
 once did i lay an ambush for your life
 a trespass that doth vex my grieved soul
 but ere i last received the sacrament
 i did confess it and exactly begg'd
 your grace's pardon and i hope i had it
 this is my fault as for the rest appeall'd
 it issues from the rancour of a villain
 a recreant and most degenerate traitor
 which in myself i boldly will defend
 and interchangeably hurl down my gage
 upon this overweening traitor's foot
 to prove myself a loyal gentleman
 even in the best blood chamber'd in his bosom
 in haste whereof most heartily i pray
 your highness to assign our trial day
king richard ii wrathkindled gentlemen be ruled by me
 let's purge this choler without letting blood
 this we prescribe though no physician
 deep malice makes too deep incision
 forget forgive conclude and be agreed
 our doctors say this is no month to bleed
 good uncle let this end where it begun
 we'll calm the duke of norfolk you your son
john of gaunt to be a makepeace shall become my age
 throw down my son the duke of norfolk's gage
king richard ii and norfolk throw down his
john of gaunt when harry when
 obedience bids i should not bid again
king richard ii norfolk throw down we bid there is no boot
thomas mowbray myself i throw dread sovereign at thy foot
 my life thou shalt command but not my shame
 the one my duty owes but my fair name
 despite of death that lives upon my grave
 to dark dishonour's use thou shalt not have
 i am disgraced impeach'd and baffled here
 pierced to the soul with slander's venom'd spear
 the which no balm can cure but his heartblood
 which breathed this poison
king richard ii rage must be withstood
 give me his gage lions make leopards tame
thomas mowbray yea but not change his spots take but my shame
 and i resign my gage my dear dear lord
 the purest treasure mortal times afford
 is spotless reputation that away
 men are but gilded loam or painted clay
 a jewel in a tentimesbarr'dup chest
 is a bold spirit in a loyal breast
 mine honour is my life both grow in one
 take honour from me and my life is done
 then dear my liege mine honour let me try
 in that i live and for that will i die
king richard ii cousin throw up your gage do you begin
henry bolingbroke o god defend my soul from such deep sin
 shall i seem crestfall'n in my father's sight
 or with pale beggarfear impeach my height
 before this outdared dastard ere my tongue
 shall wound my honour with such feeble wrong
 or sound so base a parle my teeth shall tear
 the slavish motive of recanting fear
 and spit it bleeding in his high disgrace
 where shame doth harbour even in mowbray's face
 exit john of gaunt
king richard ii we were not born to sue but to command
 which since we cannot do to make you friends
 be ready as your lives shall answer it
 at coventry upon saint lambert's day
 there shall your swords and lances arbitrate
 the swelling difference of your settled hate
 since we can not atone you we shall see
 justice design the victor's chivalry
 lord marshal command our officers at arms
 be ready to direct these home alarms
 exeunt
 king richard ii
act i
scene ii the duke of lancaster's palace
 enter john of gaunt with duchess
john of gaunt alas the part i had in woodstock's blood
 doth more solicit me than your exclaims
 to stir against the butchers of his life
 but since correction lieth in those hands
 which made the fault that we cannot correct
 put we our quarrel to the will of heaven
 who when they see the hours ripe on earth
 will rain hot vengeance on offenders heads
duchess finds brotherhood in thee no sharper spur
 hath love in thy old blood no living fire
 edward's seven sons whereof thyself art one
 were as seven vials of his sacred blood
 or seven fair branches springing from one root
 some of those seven are dried by nature's course
 some of those branches by the destinies cut
 but thomas my dear lord my life my gloucester
 one vial full of edward's sacred blood
 one flourishing branch of his most royal root
 is crack'd and all the precious liquor spilt
 is hack'd down and his summer leaves all faded
 by envy's hand and murder's bloody axe
 ah gaunt his blood was thine that bed that womb
 that metal that selfmould that fashion'd thee
 made him a man and though thou livest and breathest
 yet art thou slain in him thou dost consent
 in some large measure to thy father's death
 in that thou seest thy wretched brother die
 who was the model of thy father's life
 call it not patience gaunt it is despair
 in suffering thus thy brother to be slaughter'd
 thou showest the naked pathway to thy life
 teaching stern murder how to butcher thee
 that which in mean men we intitle patience
 is pale cold cowardice in noble breasts
 what shall i say to safeguard thine own life
 the best way is to venge my gloucester's death
john of gaunt god's is the quarrel for god's substitute
 his deputy anointed in his sight
 hath caused his death the which if wrongfully
 let heaven revenge for i may never lift
 an angry arm against his minister
duchess where then alas may i complain myself
john of gaunt to god the widow's champion and defence
duchess why then i will farewell old gaunt
 thou goest to coventry there to behold
 our cousin hereford and fell mowbray fight
 o sit my husband's wrongs on hereford's spear
 that it may enter butcher mowbray's breast
 or if misfortune miss the first career
 be mowbray's sins so heavy in his bosom
 they may break his foaming courser's back
 and throw the rider headlong in the lists
 a caitiff recreant to my cousin hereford
 farewell old gaunt thy sometimes brother's wife
 with her companion grief must end her life
john of gaunt sister farewell i must to coventry
 as much good stay with thee as go with me
duchess yet one word more grief boundeth where it falls
 not with the empty hollowness but weight
