king henry iv i know thee not old man fall to thy prayers
 how ill white hairs become a fool and jester

 but being awaked i do despise my dream
 make less thy body hence and more thy grace
 leave gormandizing know the grave doth gape
 for thee thrice wider than for other men
 reply not to me with a foolborn jest
 presume not that i am the thing i was
 for god doth know so shall the world perceive
 that i have turn'd away my former self
 so will i those that kept me company
 when thou dost hear i am as i have been
 approach me and thou shalt be as thou wast
 the tutor and the feeder of my riots
 till then i banish thee on pain of death
 as i have done the rest of my misleaders
 not to come near our person by ten mile
 for competence of life i will allow you
 that lack of means enforce you not to evil
 and as we hear you do reform yourselves
 we will according to your strengths and qualities
 give you advancement be it your charge my lord
 to see perform'd the tenor of our word set on
 exeunt king henry v &c

 epilogue
 spoken by a dancer
 first my fear then my courtesy last my speech
 my fear is your displeasure my courtesy my duty
 and my speech to beg your pardons if you look
 for a good speech now you undo me for what i have
 to say is of mine own making and what indeed i
 should say will i doubt prove mine own marring
 but to the purpose and so to the venture be it
 known to you as it is very well i was lately here
 in the end of a displeasing play to pray your
 patience for it and to promise you a better i
 meant indeed to pay you with this which if like an
 ill venture it come unluckily home i break and
 you my gentle creditors lose here i promised you
 i would be and here i commit my body to your
 mercies bate me some and i will pay you some and
 as most debtors do promise you infinitely
 if my tongue cannot entreat you to acquit me will
 you command me to use my legs and yet that were but
 light payment to dance out of your debt but a
 good conscience will make any possible satisfaction
 and so would i all the gentlewomen here have
 forgiven me if the gentlemen will not then the
 gentlemen do not agree with the gentlewomen which
 was never seen before in such an assembly
 one word more i beseech you if you be not too
 much cloyed with fat meat our humble author will
 continue the story with sir john in it and make
 you merry with fair katharine of france where for
 any thing i know falstaff shall die of a sweat
 unless already a be killed with your hard
 opinions for oldcastle died a martyr and this is
 not the man my tongue is weary when my legs are
 too i will bid you good night and so kneel down
 before you but indeed to pray for the queen
