and the sons of joseph which were born him in egypt were two souls all the souls of the house of jacob which came into egypt were threescore and ten
and he sent judah before him unto joseph to direct his face unto goshen and they came into the land of goshen
and joseph made ready his chariot and went up to meet israel his father to goshen and presented himself unto him and he fell on his neck and wept on his neck a good while
and israel said unto joseph now let me die since i have seen thy face because thou art yet alive
and joseph said unto his brethren and unto his father's house i will go up and shew pharaoh and say unto him my brethren and my father's house which were in the land of canaan are come unto me
and the men are shepherds for their trade hath been to feed cattle and they have brought their flocks and their herds and all that they have
and it shall come to pass when pharaoh shall call you and shall say what is your occupation
that ye shall say thy servants trade hath been about cattle from our youth even until now both we and also our fathers that ye may dwell in the land of goshen for every shepherd is an abomination unto the egyptians
then joseph came and told pharaoh and said my father and my brethren and their flocks and their herds and all that they have are come out of the land of canaan and behold they are in the land of goshen
and he took some of his brethren even five men and presented them unto pharaoh
and pharaoh said unto his brethren what is your occupation and they said unto pharaoh thy servants are shepherds both we and also our fathers
they said moreover unto pharaoh for to sojourn in the land are we come for thy servants have no pasture for their flocks for the famine is sore in the land of canaan now therefore we pray thee let thy servants dwell in the land of goshen
and pharaoh spake unto joseph saying thy father and thy brethren are come unto thee
the land of egypt is before thee in the best of the land make thy father and brethren to dwell in the land of goshen let them dwell and if thou knowest any men of activity among them then make them rulers over my cattle
and joseph brought in jacob his father and set him before pharaoh and jacob blessed pharaoh
and pharaoh said unto jacob how old art thou
and jacob said unto pharaoh the days of the years of my pilgrimage are an hundred and thirty years few and evil have the days of the years of my life been and have not attained unto the days of the years of the life of my fathers in the days of their pilgrimage
and jacob blessed pharaoh and went out from before pharaoh
and joseph placed his father and his brethren and gave them a possession in the land of egypt in the best of the land in the land of rameses as pharaoh had commanded
and joseph nourished his father and his brethren and all his father's household with bread according to their families
and there was no bread in all the land for the famine was very sore so that the land of egypt and all the land of canaan fainted by reason of the famine
and joseph gathered up all the money that was found in the land of egypt and in the land of canaan for the corn which they bought and joseph brought the money into pharaoh's house
and when money failed in the land of egypt and in the land of canaan all the egyptians came unto joseph and said give us bread for why should we die in thy presence for the money faileth
and joseph said give your cattle and i will give you for your cattle if money fail
and they brought their cattle unto joseph and joseph gave them bread in exchange for horses and for the flocks and for the cattle of the herds and for the asses and he fed them with bread for all their cattle for that year
when that year was ended they came unto him the second year and said unto him we will not hide it from my lord how that our money is spent my lord also hath our herds of cattle there is not ought left in the sight of my lord but our bodies and our lands
wherefore shall we die before thine eyes both we and our land buy us and our land for bread and we and our land will be servants unto pharaoh and give us seed that we may live and not die that the land be not desolate
and joseph bought all the land of egypt for pharaoh for the egyptians sold every man his field because the famine prevailed over them so the land became pharaoh's
and as for the people he removed them to cities from one end of the borders of egypt even to the other end thereof
only the land of the priests bought he not for the priests had a portion assigned them of pharaoh and did eat their portion which pharaoh gave them wherefore they sold not their lands
then joseph said unto the people behold i have bought you this day and your land for pharaoh lo here is seed for you and ye shall sow the land
and it shall come to pass in the increase that ye shall give the fifth part unto pharaoh and four parts shall be your own for seed of the field and for your food and for them of your households and for food for your little ones
and they said thou hast saved our lives let us find grace in the sight of my lord and we will be pharaoh's servants
and joseph made it a law over the land of egypt unto this day that pharaoh should have the fifth part except the land of the priests only which became not pharaoh's
and israel dwelt in the land of egypt in the country of goshen and they had possessions therein and grew and multiplied exceedingly
and jacob lived in the land of egypt seventeen years so the whole age of jacob was an hundred forty and seven years
and the time drew nigh that israel must die and he called his son joseph and said unto him if now i have found grace in thy sight put i pray thee thy hand under my thigh and deal kindly and truly with me bury me not i pray thee in egypt
but i will lie with my fathers and thou shalt carry me out of egypt and bury me in their buryingplace and he said i will do as thou hast said
and he said swear unto me and he sware unto him and israel bowed himself upon the bed's head
and it came to pass after these things that one told joseph behold thy father is sick and he took with him his two sons manasseh and ephraim
and one told jacob and said behold thy son joseph cometh unto thee and israel strengthened himself and sat upon the bed
and jacob said unto joseph god almighty appeared unto me at luz in the land of canaan and blessed me
and said unto me behold i will make thee fruitful and multiply thee and i will make of thee a multitude of people and will give this land to thy seed after thee for an everlasting possession
and now thy two sons ephraim and manasseh which were born unto thee in the land of egypt before i came unto thee into egypt are mine as reuben and simeon they shall be mine
and thy issue which thou begettest after them shall be thine and shall be called after the name of their brethren in their inheritance
and as for me when i came from padan rachel died by me in the land of canaan in the way when yet there was but a little way to come unto ephrath and i buried her there in the way of ephrath the same is bethlehem
and israel beheld joseph's sons and said who are these
and joseph said unto his father they are my sons whom god hath given me in this place and he said bring them i pray thee unto me and i will bless them
now the eyes of israel were dim for age so that he could not see and he brought them near unto him and he kissed them and embraced them
and israel said unto joseph i had not thought to see thy face and lo god hath shewed me also thy seed
and joseph brought them out from between his knees and he bowed himself with his face to the earth
and joseph took them both ephraim in his right hand toward israel's left hand and manasseh in his left hand toward israel's right hand and brought them near unto him
and israel stretched out his right hand and laid it upon ephraim's head who was the younger and his left hand upon manasseh's head guiding his hands wittingly for manasseh was the firstborn
and he blessed joseph and said god before whom my fathers abraham and isaac did walk the god which fed me all my life long unto this day
the angel which redeemed me from all evil bless the lads and let my name be named on them and the name of my fathers abraham and isaac and let them grow into a multitude in the midst of the earth
and when joseph saw that his father laid his right hand upon the head of ephraim it displeased him and he held up his father's hand to remove it from ephraim's head unto manasseh's head
and joseph said unto his father not so my father for this is the firstborn put thy right hand upon his head
and his father refused and said i know it my son i know it he also shall become a people and he also shall be great but truly his younger brother shall be greater than he and his seed shall become a multitude of nations
and he blessed them that day saying in thee shall israel bless saying god make thee as ephraim and as manasseh and he set ephraim before manasseh
and israel said unto joseph behold i die but god shall be with you and bring you again unto the land of your fathers
moreover i have given to thee one portion above thy brethren which i took out of the hand of the amorite with my sword and with my bow
and jacob called unto his sons and said gather yourselves together that i may tell you that which shall befall you in the last days
gather yourselves together and hear ye sons of jacob and hearken unto israel your father
reuben thou art my firstborn my might and the beginning of my strength the excellency of dignity and the excellency of power
unstable as water thou shalt not excel because thou wentest up to thy father's bed then defiledst thou it he went up to my couch
simeon and levi are brethren instruments of cruelty are in their habitations
o my soul come not thou into their secret unto their assembly mine honour be not thou united for in their anger they slew a man and in their selfwill they digged down a wall
cursed be their anger for it was fierce and their wrath for it was cruel i will divide them in jacob and scatter them in israel
judah thou art he whom thy brethren shall praise thy hand shall be in the neck of thine enemies thy father's children shall bow down before thee
judah is a lion's whelp from the prey my son thou art gone up he stooped down he couched as a lion and as an old lion who shall rouse him up
the sceptre shall not depart from judah nor a lawgiver from between his feet until shiloh come and unto him shall the gathering of the people be
binding his foal unto the vine and his ass's colt unto the choice vine he washed his garments in wine and his clothes in the blood of grapes
his eyes shall be red with wine and his teeth white with milk
zebulun shall dwell at the haven of the sea and he shall be for an haven of ships and his border shall be unto zidon
issachar is a strong ass couching down between two burdens
and he saw that rest was good and the land that it was pleasant and bowed his shoulder to bear and became a servant unto tribute
dan shall judge his people as one of the tribes of israel
dan shall be a serpent by the way an adder in the path that biteth the horse heels so that his rider shall fall backward
i have waited for thy salvation o lord
gad a troop shall overcome him but he shall overcome at the last
out of asher his bread shall be fat and he shall yield royal dainties
naphtali is a hind let loose he giveth goodly words
joseph is a fruitful bough even a fruitful bough by a well whose branches run over the wall
the archers have sorely grieved him and shot at him and hated him
but his bow abode in strength and the arms of his hands were made strong by the hands of the mighty god of jacob from thence is the shepherd the stone of israel
even by the god of thy father who shall help thee and by the almighty who shall bless thee with blessings of heaven above blessings of the deep that lieth under blessings of the breasts and of the womb
the blessings of thy father have prevailed above the blessings of my progenitors unto the utmost bound of the everlasting hills they shall be on the head of joseph and on the crown of the head of him that was separate from his brethren
benjamin shall ravin as a wolf in the morning he shall devour the prey and at night he shall divide the spoil
all these are the twelve tribes of israel and this is it that their father spake unto them and blessed them every one according to his blessing he blessed them
and he charged them and said unto them i am to be gathered unto my people bury me with my fathers in the cave that is in the field of ephron the hittite
in the cave that is in the field of machpelah which is before mamre in the land of canaan which abraham bought with the field of ephron the hittite for a possession of a buryingplace
there they buried abraham and sarah his wife there they buried isaac and rebekah his wife and there i buried leah
the purchase of the field and of the cave that is therein was from the children of heth
and when jacob had made an end of commanding his sons he gathered up his feet into the bed and yielded up the ghost and was gathered unto his people
and joseph fell upon his father's face and wept upon him and kissed him
and joseph commanded his servants the physicians to embalm his father and the physicians embalmed israel
and forty days were fulfilled for him for so are fulfilled the days of those which are embalmed and the egyptians mourned for him threescore and ten days
and when the days of his mourning were past joseph spake unto the house of pharaoh saying if now i have found grace in your eyes speak i pray you in the ears of pharaoh saying
my father made me swear saying lo i die in my grave which i have digged for me in the land of canaan there shalt thou bury me now therefore let me go up i pray thee and bury my father and i will come again
and pharaoh said go up and bury thy father according as he made thee swear
and joseph went up to bury his father and with him went up all the servants of pharaoh the elders of his house and all the elders of the land of egypt
and all the house of joseph and his brethren and his father's house only their little ones and their flocks and their herds they left in the land of goshen
and there went up with him both chariots and horsemen and it was a very great company
and they came to the threshingfloor of atad which is beyond jordan and there they mourned with a great and very sore lamentation and he made a mourning for his father seven days
and when the inhabitants of the land the canaanites saw the mourning in the floor of atad they said this is a grievous mourning to the egyptians wherefore the name of it was called abelmizraim which is beyond jordan
and his sons did unto him according as he commanded them
for his sons carried him into the land of canaan and buried him in the cave of the field of machpelah which abraham bought with the field for a possession of a buryingplace of ephron the hittite before mamre
and joseph returned into egypt he and his brethren and all that went up with him to bury his father after he had buried his father
and when joseph's brethren saw that their father was dead they said joseph will peradventure hate us and will certainly requite us all the evil which we did unto him
and they sent a messenger unto joseph saying thy father did command before he died saying
so shall ye say unto joseph forgive i pray thee now the trespass of thy brethren and their sin for they did unto thee evil and now we pray thee forgive the trespass of the servants of the god of thy father and joseph wept when they spake unto him
and his brethren also went and fell down before his face and they said behold we be thy servants
and joseph said unto them fear not for am i in the place of god
but as for you ye thought evil against me but god meant it unto good to bring to pass as it is this day to save much people alive
now therefore fear ye not i will nourish you and your little ones and he comforted them and spake kindly unto them
and joseph dwelt in egypt he and his father's house and joseph lived an hundred and ten years
and joseph saw ephraim's children of the third generation the children also of machir the son of manasseh were brought up upon joseph's knees
and joseph said unto his brethren i die and god will surely visit you and bring you out of this land unto the land which he sware to abraham to isaac and to jacob
and joseph took an oath of the children of israel saying god will surely visit you and ye shall carry up my bones from hence
so joseph died being an hundred and ten years old and they embalmed him and he was put in a coffin in egypt
now these are the names of the children of israel which came into egypt every man and his household came with jacob
reuben simeon levi and judah
issachar zebulun and benjamin
dan and naphtali gad and asher
and all the souls that came out of the loins of jacob were seventy souls for joseph was in egypt already
and joseph died and all his brethren and all that generation
and the children of israel were fruitful and increased abundantly and multiplied and waxed exceeding mighty and the land was filled with them
now there arose up a new king over egypt which knew not joseph
and he said unto his people behold the people of the children of israel are more and mightier than we
come on let us deal wisely with them lest they multiply and it come to pass that when there falleth out any war they join also unto our enemies and fight against us and so get them up out of the land
therefore they did set over them taskmasters to afflict them with their burdens and they built for pharaoh treasure cities pithom and raamses
but the more they afflicted them the more they multiplied and grew and they were grieved because of the children of israel
and the egyptians made the children of israel to serve with rigour
and they made their lives bitter with hard bondage in morter and in brick and in all manner of service in the field all their service wherein they made them serve was with rigour
and the king of egypt spake to the hebrew midwives of which the name of the one was shiphrah and the name of the other puah
and he said when ye do the office of a midwife to the hebrew women and see them upon the stools if it be a son then ye shall kill him but if it be a daughter then she shall live
but the midwives feared god and did not as the king of egypt commanded them but saved the men children alive
and the king of egypt called for the midwives and said unto them why have ye done this thing and have saved the men children alive
and the midwives said unto pharaoh because the hebrew women are not as the egyptian women for they are lively and are delivered ere the midwives come in unto them
therefore god dealt well with the midwives and the people multiplied and waxed very mighty
and it came to pass because the midwives feared god that he made them houses
and pharaoh charged all his people saying every son that is born ye shall cast into the river and every daughter ye shall save alive
and there went a man of the house of levi and took to wife a daughter of levi
and the woman conceived and bare a son and when she saw him that he was a goodly child she hid him three months
and when she could not longer hide him she took for him an ark of bulrushes and daubed it with slime and with pitch and put the child therein and she laid it in the flags by the river's brink
and his sister stood afar off to wit what would be done to him
and the daughter of pharaoh came down to wash herself at the river and her maidens walked along by the river's side and when she saw the ark among the flags she sent her maid to fetch it
and when she had opened it she saw the child and behold the babe wept and she had compassion on him and said this is one of the hebrews children
then said his sister to pharaoh's daughter shall i go and call to thee a nurse of the hebrew women that she may nurse the child for thee
and pharaoh's daughter said to her go and the maid went and called the child's mother
and pharaoh's daughter said unto her take this child away and nurse it for me and i will give thee thy wages and the woman took the child and nursed it
and the child grew and she brought him unto pharaoh's daughter and he became her son and she called his name moses and she said because i drew him out of the water
and it came to pass in those days when moses was grown that he went out unto his brethren and looked on their burdens and he spied an egyptian smiting an hebrew one of his brethren
and he looked this way and that way and when he saw that there was no man he slew the egyptian and hid him in the sand
and when he went out the second day behold two men of the hebrews strove together and he said to him that did the wrong wherefore smitest thou thy fellow
and he said who made thee a prince and a judge over us intendest thou to kill me as thou killedst the egyptian and moses feared and said surely this thing is known
now when pharaoh heard this thing he sought to slay moses but moses fled from the face of pharaoh and dwelt in the land of midian and he sat down by a well
now the priest of midian had seven daughters and they came and drew water and filled the troughs to water their father's flock
and the shepherds came and drove them away but moses stood up and helped them and watered their flock
and when they came to reuel their father he said how is it that ye are come so soon to day
and they said an egyptian delivered us out of the hand of the shepherds and also drew water enough for us and watered the flock
and he said unto his daughters and where is he why is it that ye have left the man call him that he may eat bread
and moses was content to dwell with the man and he gave moses zipporah his daughter
and she bare him a son and he called his name gershom for he said i have been a stranger in a strange land
and it came to pass in process of time that the king of egypt died and the children of israel sighed by reason of the bondage and they cried and their cry came up unto god by reason of the bondage
and god heard their groaning and god remembered his covenant with abraham with isaac and with jacob
and god looked upon the children of israel and god had respect unto them
now moses kept the flock of jethro his father in law the priest of midian and he led the flock to the backside of the desert and came to the mountain of god even to horeb
and the angel of the lord appeared unto him in a flame of fire out of the midst of a bush and he looked and behold the bush burned with fire and the bush was not consumed
and moses said i will now turn aside and see this great sight why the bush is not burnt
and when the lord saw that he turned aside to see god called unto him out of the midst of the bush and said moses moses and he said here am i
and he said draw not nigh hither put off thy shoes from off thy feet for the place whereon thou standest is holy ground
moreover he said i am the god of thy father the god of abraham the god of isaac and the god of jacob and moses hid his face for he was afraid to look upon god
and the lord said i have surely seen the affliction of my people which are in egypt and have heard their cry by reason of their taskmasters for i know their sorrows
and i am come down to deliver them out of the hand of the egyptians and to bring them up out of that land unto a good land and a large unto a land flowing with milk and honey unto the place of the canaanites and the hittites and the amorites and the perizzites and the hivites and the jebusites
now therefore behold the cry of the children of israel is come unto me and i have also seen the oppression wherewith the egyptians oppress them
come now therefore and i will send thee unto pharaoh that thou mayest bring forth my people the children of israel out of egypt
and moses said unto god who am i that i should go unto pharaoh and that i should bring forth the children of israel out of egypt
and he said certainly i will be with thee and this shall be a token unto thee that i have sent thee when thou hast brought forth the people out of egypt ye shall serve god upon this mountain
and moses said unto god behold when i come unto the children of israel and shall say unto them the god of your fathers hath sent me unto you and they shall say to me what is his name what shall i say unto them
and god said unto moses i am that i am and he said thus shalt thou say unto the children of israel i am hath sent me unto you
and god said moreover unto moses thus shalt thou say unto the children of israel the lord god of your fathers the god of abraham the god of isaac and the god of jacob hath sent me unto you this is my name for ever and this is my memorial unto all generations
go and gather the elders of israel together and say unto them the lord god of your fathers the god of abraham of isaac and of jacob appeared unto me saying i have surely visited you and seen that which is done to you in egypt
and i have said i will bring you up out of the affliction of egypt unto the land of the canaanites and the hittites and the amorites and the perizzites and the hivites and the jebusites unto a land flowing with milk and honey
and they shall hearken to thy voice and thou shalt come thou and the elders of israel unto the king of egypt and ye shall say unto him the lord god of the hebrews hath met with us and now let us go we beseech thee three days journey into the wilderness that we may sacrifice to the lord our god
