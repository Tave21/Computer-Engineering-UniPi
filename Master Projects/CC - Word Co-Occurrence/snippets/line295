 in carrionflies than romeo they my seize
 on the white wonder of dear juliet's hand
 and steal immortal blessing from her lips
 who even in pure and vestal modesty
 still blush as thinking their own kisses sin
 but romeo may not he is banished
 flies may do this but i from this must fly
 they are free men but i am banished
 and say'st thou yet that exile is not death
 hadst thou no poison mix'd no sharpground knife
 no sudden mean of death though ne'er so mean
 but banished to kill me'banished'
 o friar the damned use that word in hell
 howlings attend it how hast thou the heart
 being a divine a ghostly confessor
 a sinabsolver and my friend profess'd
 to mangle me with that word banished'
friar laurence thou fond mad man hear me but speak a word
romeo o thou wilt speak again of banishment
friar laurence i'll give thee armour to keep off that word
 adversity's sweet milk philosophy
 to comfort thee though thou art banished
romeo yet banished hang up philosophy
 unless philosophy can make a juliet
 displant a town reverse a prince's doom
 it helps not it prevails not talk no more
friar laurence o then i see that madmen have no ears
romeo how should they when that wise men have no eyes
friar laurence let me dispute with thee of thy estate
romeo thou canst not speak of that thou dost not feel
 wert thou as young as i juliet thy love
 an hour but married tybalt murdered
 doting like me and like me banished
 then mightst thou speak then mightst thou tear thy hair
 and fall upon the ground as i do now
 taking the measure of an unmade grave
 knocking within
friar laurence arise one knocks good romeo hide thyself
romeo not i unless the breath of heartsick groans
 mistlike infold me from the search of eyes
 knocking
friar laurence hark how they knock who's there romeo arise
 thou wilt be taken stay awhile stand up
 knocking
 run to my study by and by god's will
 what simpleness is this i come i come
 knocking
 who knocks so hard whence come you what's your will
nurse within let me come in and you shall know
 my errand
 i come from lady juliet
friar laurence welcome then
 enter nurse
nurse o holy friar o tell me holy friar
 where is my lady's lord where's romeo
friar laurence there on the ground with his own tears made drunk
nurse o he is even in my mistress case
 just in her case o woful sympathy
 piteous predicament even so lies she
 blubbering and weeping weeping and blubbering
 stand up stand up stand and you be a man
 for juliet's sake for her sake rise and stand
 why should you fall into so deep an o
romeo nurse
nurse ah sir ah sir well death's the end of all
romeo spakest thou of juliet how is it with her
 doth she not think me an old murderer
 now i have stain'd the childhood of our joy
 with blood removed but little from her own
 where is she and how doth she and what says
 my conceal'd lady to our cancell'd love
nurse o she says nothing sir but weeps and weeps
 and now falls on her bed and then starts up
 and tybalt calls and then on romeo cries
 and then down falls again
romeo as if that name
 shot from the deadly level of a gun
 did murder her as that name's cursed hand
 murder'd her kinsman o tell me friar tell me
 in what vile part of this anatomy
 doth my name lodge tell me that i may sack
 the hateful mansion
 drawing his sword
friar laurence hold thy desperate hand
 art thou a man thy form cries out thou art
 thy tears are womanish thy wild acts denote
 the unreasonable fury of a beast
 unseemly woman in a seeming man
 or illbeseeming beast in seeming both
 thou hast amazed me by my holy order
 i thought thy disposition better temper'd
 hast thou slain tybalt wilt thou slay thyself
 and stay thy lady too that lives in thee
 by doing damned hate upon thyself
 why rail'st thou on thy birth the heaven and earth
 since birth and heaven and earth all three do meet
 in thee at once which thou at once wouldst lose
 fie fie thou shamest thy shape thy love thy wit
 which like a usurer abound'st in all
 and usest none in that true use indeed
 which should bedeck thy shape thy love thy wit
 thy noble shape is but a form of wax
 digressing from the valour of a man
 thy dear love sworn but hollow perjury
 killing that love which thou hast vow'd to cherish
 thy wit that ornament to shape and love
 misshapen in the conduct of them both
 like powder in a skitless soldier's flask
 is set afire by thine own ignorance
 and thou dismember'd with thine own defence
 what rouse thee man thy juliet is alive
 for whose dear sake thou wast but lately dead
 there art thou happy tybalt would kill thee
 but thou slew'st tybalt there are thou happy too
 the law that threaten'd death becomes thy friend
 and turns it to exile there art thou happy
 a pack of blessings lights up upon thy back
 happiness courts thee in her best array
 but like a misbehaved and sullen wench
 thou pout'st upon thy fortune and thy love
 take heed take heed for such die miserable
 go get thee to thy love as was decreed
 ascend her chamber hence and comfort her
 but look thou stay not till the watch be set
 for then thou canst not pass to mantua
 where thou shalt live till we can find a time
 to blaze your marriage reconcile your friends
 beg pardon of the prince and call thee back
 with twenty hundred thousand times more joy
 than thou went'st forth in lamentation
 go before nurse commend me to thy lady
 and bid her hasten all the house to bed
 which heavy sorrow makes them apt unto
 romeo is coming
nurse o lord i could have stay'd here all the night
 to hear good counsel o what learning is
 my lord i'll tell my lady you will come
romeo do so and bid my sweet prepare to chide
nurse here sir a ring she bid me give you sir
 hie you make haste for it grows very late
 exit
romeo how well my comfort is revived by this
friar laurence go hence good night and here stands all your state
 either be gone before the watch be set
 or by the break of day disguised from hence
 sojourn in mantua i'll find out your man
 and he shall signify from time to time
 every good hap to you that chances here
 give me thy hand tis late farewell good night
romeo but that a joy past joy calls out on me
 it were a grief so brief to part with thee farewell
