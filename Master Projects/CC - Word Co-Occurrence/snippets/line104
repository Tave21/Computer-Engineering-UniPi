thus saith the lord god because thy filthiness was poured out and thy nakedness discovered through thy whoredoms with thy lovers and with all the idols of thy abominations and by the blood of thy children which thou didst give unto them
behold therefore i will gather all thy lovers with whom thou hast taken pleasure and all them that thou hast loved with all them that thou hast hated i will even gather them round about against thee and will discover thy nakedness unto them that they may see all thy nakedness
and i will judge thee as women that break wedlock and shed blood are judged and i will give thee blood in fury and jealousy
and i will also give thee into their hand and they shall throw down thine eminent place and shall break down thy high places they shall strip thee also of thy clothes and shall take thy fair jewels and leave thee naked and bare
they shall also bring up a company against thee and they shall stone thee with stones and thrust thee through with their swords
and they shall burn thine houses with fire and execute judgments upon thee in the sight of many women and i will cause thee to cease from playing the harlot and thou also shalt give no hire any more
so will i make my fury toward thee to rest and my jealousy shall depart from thee and i will be quiet and will be no more angry
because thou hast not remembered the days of thy youth but hast fretted me in all these things behold therefore i also will recompense thy way upon thine head saith the lord god and thou shalt not commit this lewdness above all thine abominations
behold every one that useth proverbs shall use this proverb against thee saying as is the mother so is her daughter
thou art thy mother's daughter that lotheth her husband and her children and thou art the sister of thy sisters which lothed their husbands and their children your mother was an hittite and your father an amorite
and thine elder sister is samaria she and her daughters that dwell at thy left hand and thy younger sister that dwelleth at thy right hand is sodom and her daughters
yet hast thou not walked after their ways nor done after their abominations but as if that were a very little thing thou wast corrupted more than they in all thy ways
as i live saith the lord god sodom thy sister hath not done she nor her daughters as thou hast done thou and thy daughters
behold this was the iniquity of thy sister sodom pride fulness of bread and abundance of idleness was in her and in her daughters neither did she strengthen the hand of the poor and needy
and they were haughty and committed abomination before me therefore i took them away as i saw good
neither hath samaria committed half of thy sins but thou hast multiplied thine abominations more than they and hast justified thy sisters in all thine abominations which thou hast done
thou also which hast judged thy sisters bear thine own shame for thy sins that thou hast committed more abominable than they they are more righteous than thou yea be thou confounded also and bear thy shame in that thou hast justified thy sisters
when i shall bring again their captivity the captivity of sodom and her daughters and the captivity of samaria and her daughters then will i bring again the captivity of thy captives in the midst of them
that thou mayest bear thine own shame and mayest be confounded in all that thou hast done in that thou art a comfort unto them
when thy sisters sodom and her daughters shall return to their former estate and samaria and her daughters shall return to their former estate then thou and thy daughters shall return to your former estate
for thy sister sodom was not mentioned by thy mouth in the day of thy pride
before thy wickedness was discovered as at the time of thy reproach of the daughters of syria and all that are round about her the daughters of the philistines which despise thee round about
thou hast borne thy lewdness and thine abominations saith the lord
for thus saith the lord god i will even deal with thee as thou hast done which hast despised the oath in breaking the covenant
nevertheless i will remember my covenant with thee in the days of thy youth and i will establish unto thee an everlasting covenant
then thou shalt remember thy ways and be ashamed when thou shalt receive thy sisters thine elder and thy younger and i will give them unto thee for daughters but not by thy covenant
and i will establish my covenant with thee and thou shalt know that i am the lord
that thou mayest remember and be confounded and never open thy mouth any more because of thy shame when i am pacified toward thee for all that thou hast done saith the lord god
and the word of the lord came unto me saying
son of man put forth a riddle and speak a parable unto the house of israel
and say thus saith the lord god a great eagle with great wings longwinged full of feathers which had divers colours came unto lebanon and took the highest branch of the cedar
he cropped off the top of his young twigs and carried it into a land of traffick he set it in a city of merchants
he took also of the seed of the land and planted it in a fruitful field he placed it by great waters and set it as a willow tree
and it grew and became a spreading vine of low stature whose branches turned toward him and the roots thereof were under him so it became a vine and brought forth branches and shot forth sprigs
there was also another great eagle with great wings and many feathers and behold this vine did bend her roots toward him and shot forth her branches toward him that he might water it by the furrows of her plantation
it was planted in a good soil by great waters that it might bring forth branches and that it might bear fruit that it might be a goodly vine
say thou thus saith the lord god shall it prosper shall he not pull up the roots thereof and cut off the fruit thereof that it wither it shall wither in all the leaves of her spring even without great power or many people to pluck it up by the roots thereof
yea behold being planted shall it prosper shall it not utterly wither when the east wind toucheth it it shall wither in the furrows where it grew
moreover the word of the lord came unto me saying
say now to the rebellious house know ye not what these things mean tell them behold the king of babylon is come to jerusalem and hath taken the king thereof and the princes thereof and led them with him to babylon
and hath taken of the king's seed and made a covenant with him and hath taken an oath of him he hath also taken the mighty of the land
that the kingdom might be base that it might not lift itself up but that by keeping of his covenant it might stand
but he rebelled against him in sending his ambassadors into egypt that they might give him horses and much people shall he prosper shall he escape that doeth such things or shall he break the covenant and be delivered
as i live saith the lord god surely in the place where the king dwelleth that made him king whose oath he despised and whose covenant he brake even with him in the midst of babylon he shall die
neither shall pharaoh with his mighty army and great company make for him in the war by casting up mounts and building forts to cut off many persons
seeing he despised the oath by breaking the covenant when lo he had given his hand and hath done all these things he shall not escape
therefore thus saith the lord god as i live surely mine oath that he hath despised and my covenant that he hath broken even it will i recompense upon his own head
and i will spread my net upon him and he shall be taken in my snare and i will bring him to babylon and will plead with him there for his trespass that he hath trespassed against me
and all his fugitives with all his bands shall fall by the sword and they that remain shall be scattered toward all winds and ye shall know that i the lord have spoken it
thus saith the lord god i will also take of the highest branch of the high cedar and will set it i will crop off from the top of his young twigs a tender one and will plant it upon an high mountain and eminent
in the mountain of the height of israel will i plant it and it shall bring forth boughs and bear fruit and be a goodly cedar and under it shall dwell all fowl of every wing in the shadow of the branches thereof shall they dwell
and all the trees of the field shall know that i the lord have brought down the high tree have exalted the low tree have dried up the green tree and have made the dry tree to flourish i the lord have spoken and have done it
the word of the lord came unto me again saying
what mean ye that ye use this proverb concerning the land of israel saying the fathers have eaten sour grapes and the children's teeth are set on edge
as i live saith the lord god ye shall not have occasion any more to use this proverb in israel
behold all souls are mine as the soul of the father so also the soul of the son is mine the soul that sinneth it shall die
but if a man be just and do that which is lawful and right
and hath not eaten upon the mountains neither hath lifted up his eyes to the idols of the house of israel neither hath defiled his neighbour's wife neither hath come near to a menstruous woman
and hath not oppressed any but hath restored to the debtor his pledge hath spoiled none by violence hath given his bread to the hungry and hath covered the naked with a garment
he that hath not given forth upon usury neither hath taken any increase that hath withdrawn his hand from iniquity hath executed true judgment between man and man
hath walked in my statutes and hath kept my judgments to deal truly he is just he shall surely live saith the lord god
if he beget a son that is a robber a shedder of blood and that doeth the like to any one of these things
and that doeth not any of those duties but even hath eaten upon the mountains and defiled his neighbour's wife
hath oppressed the poor and needy hath spoiled by violence hath not restored the pledge and hath lifted up his eyes to the idols hath committed abomination
hath given forth upon usury and hath taken increase shall he then live he shall not live he hath done all these abominations he shall surely die his blood shall be upon him
now lo if he beget a son that seeth all his father's sins which he hath done and considereth and doeth not such like
that hath not eaten upon the mountains neither hath lifted up his eyes to the idols of the house of israel hath not defiled his neighbour's wife
neither hath oppressed any hath not withholden the pledge neither hath spoiled by violence but hath given his bread to the hungry and hath covered the naked with a garment
that hath taken off his hand from the poor that hath not received usury nor increase hath executed my judgments hath walked in my statutes he shall not die for the iniquity of his father he shall surely live
as for his father because he cruelly oppressed spoiled his brother by violence and did that which is not good among his people lo even he shall die in his iniquity
yet say ye why doth not the son bear the iniquity of the father when the son hath done that which is lawful and right and hath kept all my statutes and hath done them he shall surely live
the soul that sinneth it shall die the son shall not bear the iniquity of the father neither shall the father bear the iniquity of the son the righteousness of the righteous shall be upon him and the wickedness of the wicked shall be upon him
but if the wicked will turn from all his sins that he hath committed and keep all my statutes and do that which is lawful and right he shall surely live he shall not die
all his transgressions that he hath committed they shall not be mentioned unto him in his righteousness that he hath done he shall live
have i any pleasure at all that the wicked should die saith the lord god and not that he should return from his ways and live
but when the righteous turneth away from his righteousness and committeth iniquity and doeth according to all the abominations that the wicked man doeth shall he live all his righteousness that he hath done shall not be mentioned in his trespass that he hath trespassed and in his sin that he hath sinned in them shall he die
yet ye say the way of the lord is not equal hear now o house of israel is not my way equal are not your ways unequal
when a righteous man turneth away from his righteousness and committeth iniquity and dieth in them for his iniquity that he hath done shall he die
again when the wicked man turneth away from his wickedness that he hath committed and doeth that which is lawful and right he shall save his soul alive
because he considereth and turneth away from all his transgressions that he hath committed he shall surely live he shall not die
yet saith the house of israel the way of the lord is not equal o house of israel are not my ways equal are not your ways unequal
therefore i will judge you o house of israel every one according to his ways saith the lord god repent and turn yourselves from all your transgressions so iniquity shall not be your ruin
cast away from you all your transgressions whereby ye have transgressed and make you a new heart and a new spirit for why will ye die o house of israel
for i have no pleasure in the death of him that dieth saith the lord god wherefore turn yourselves and live ye
moreover take thou up a lamentation for the princes of israel
and say what is thy mother a lioness she lay down among lions she nourished her whelps among young lions
and she brought up one of her whelps it became a young lion and it learned to catch the prey it devoured men
the nations also heard of him he was taken in their pit and they brought him with chains unto the land of egypt
now when she saw that she had waited and her hope was lost then she took another of her whelps and made him a young lion
and he went up and down among the lions he became a young lion and learned to catch the prey and devoured men
and he knew their desolate palaces and he laid waste their cities and the land was desolate and the fulness thereof by the noise of his roaring
then the nations set against him on every side from the provinces and spread their net over him he was taken in their pit
and they put him in ward in chains and brought him to the king of babylon they brought him into holds that his voice should no more be heard upon the mountains of israel
thy mother is like a vine in thy blood planted by the waters she was fruitful and full of branches by reason of many waters
and she had strong rods for the sceptres of them that bare rule and her stature was exalted among the thick branches and she appeared in her height with the multitude of her branches
but she was plucked up in fury she was cast down to the ground and the east wind dried up her fruit her strong rods were broken and withered the fire consumed them
and now she is planted in the wilderness in a dry and thirsty ground
and fire is gone out of a rod of her branches which hath devoured her fruit so that she hath no strong rod to be a sceptre to rule this is a lamentation and shall be for a lamentation
and it came to pass in the seventh year in the fifth month the tenth day of the month that certain of the elders of israel came to enquire of the lord and sat before me
then came the word of the lord unto me saying
son of man speak unto the elders of israel and say unto them thus saith the lord god are ye come to enquire of me as i live saith the lord god i will not be enquired of by you
wilt thou judge them son of man wilt thou judge them cause them to know the abominations of their fathers
and say unto them thus saith the lord god in the day when i chose israel and lifted up mine hand unto the seed of the house of jacob and made myself known unto them in the land of egypt when i lifted up mine hand unto them saying i am the lord your god
in the day that i lifted up mine hand unto them to bring them forth of the land of egypt into a land that i had espied for them flowing with milk and honey which is the glory of all lands
then said i unto them cast ye away every man the abominations of his eyes and defile not yourselves with the idols of egypt i am the lord your god
but they rebelled against me and would not hearken unto me they did not every man cast away the abominations of their eyes neither did they forsake the idols of egypt then i said i will pour out my fury upon them to accomplish my anger against them in the midst of the land of egypt
but i wrought for my name's sake that it should not be polluted before the heathen among whom they were in whose sight i made myself known unto them in bringing them forth out of the land of egypt
wherefore i caused them to go forth out of the land of egypt and brought them into the wilderness
and i gave them my statutes and shewed them my judgments which if a man do he shall even live in them
moreover also i gave them my sabbaths to be a sign between me and them that they might know that i am the lord that sanctify them
but the house of israel rebelled against me in the wilderness they walked not in my statutes and they despised my judgments which if a man do he shall even live in them and my sabbaths they greatly polluted then i said i would pour out my fury upon them in the wilderness to consume them
but i wrought for my name's sake that it should not be polluted before the heathen in whose sight i brought them out
yet also i lifted up my hand unto them in the wilderness that i would not bring them into the land which i had given them flowing with milk and honey which is the glory of all lands
because they despised my judgments and walked not in my statutes but polluted my sabbaths for their heart went after their idols
nevertheless mine eye spared them from destroying them neither did i make an end of them in the wilderness
but i said unto their children in the wilderness walk ye not in the statutes of your fathers neither observe their judgments nor defile yourselves with their idols
i am the lord your god walk in my statutes and keep my judgments and do them
and hallow my sabbaths and they shall be a sign between me and you that ye may know that i am the lord your god
notwithstanding the children rebelled against me they walked not in my statutes neither kept my judgments to do them which if a man do he shall even live in them they polluted my sabbaths then i said i would pour out my fury upon them to accomplish my anger against them in the wilderness
nevertheless i withdrew mine hand and wrought for my name's sake that it should not be polluted in the sight of the heathen in whose sight i brought them forth
i lifted up mine hand unto them also in the wilderness that i would scatter them among the heathen and disperse them through the countries
because they had not executed my judgments but had despised my statutes and had polluted my sabbaths and their eyes were after their fathers idols
wherefore i gave them also statutes that were not good and judgments whereby they should not live
and i polluted them in their own gifts in that they caused to pass through the fire all that openeth the womb that i might make them desolate to the end that they might know that i am the lord
therefore son of man speak unto the house of israel and say unto them thus saith the lord god yet in this your fathers have blasphemed me in that they have committed a trespass against me
for when i had brought them into the land for the which i lifted up mine hand to give it to them then they saw every high hill and all the thick trees and they offered there their sacrifices and there they presented the provocation of their offering there also they made their sweet savour and poured out there their drink offerings
then i said unto them what is the high place whereunto ye go and the name thereof is called bamah unto this day
wherefore say unto the house of israel thus saith the lord god are ye polluted after the manner of your fathers and commit ye whoredom after their abominations
for when ye offer your gifts when ye make your sons to pass through the fire ye pollute yourselves with all your idols even unto this day and shall i be enquired of by you o house of israel as i live saith the lord god i will not be enquired of by you
and that which cometh into your mind shall not be at all that ye say we will be as the heathen as the families of the countries to serve wood and stone
as i live saith the lord god surely with a mighty hand and with a stretched out arm and with fury poured out will i rule over you
and i will bring you out from the people and will gather you out of the countries wherein ye are scattered with a mighty hand and with a stretched out arm and with fury poured out
and i will bring you into the wilderness of the people and there will i plead with you face to face
like as i pleaded with your fathers in the wilderness of the land of egypt so will i plead with you saith the lord god
and i will cause you to pass under the rod and i will bring you into the bond of the covenant
and i will purge out from among you the rebels and them that transgress against me i will bring them forth out of the country where they sojourn and they shall not enter into the land of israel and ye shall know that i am the lord
as for you o house of israel thus saith the lord god go ye serve ye every one his idols and hereafter also if ye will not hearken unto me but pollute ye my holy name no more with your gifts and with your idols
for in mine holy mountain in the mountain of the height of israel saith the lord god there shall all the house of israel all of them in the land serve me there will i accept them and there will i require your offerings and the firstfruits of your oblations with all your holy things
i will accept you with your sweet savour when i bring you out from the people and gather you out of the countries wherein ye have been scattered and i will be sanctified in you before the heathen
and ye shall know that i am the lord when i shall bring you into the land of israel into the country for the which i lifted up mine hand to give it to your fathers
and there shall ye remember your ways and all your doings wherein ye have been defiled and ye shall lothe yourselves in your own sight for all your evils that ye have committed
and ye shall know that i am the lord when i have wrought with you for my name's sake not according to your wicked ways nor according to your corrupt doings o ye house of israel saith the lord god
moreover the word of the lord came unto me saying
son of man set thy face toward the south and drop thy word toward the south and prophesy against the forest of the south field
and say to the forest of the south hear the word of the lord thus saith the lord god behold i will kindle a fire in thee and it shall devour every green tree in thee and every dry tree the flaming flame shall not be quenched and all faces from the south to the north shall be burned therein
and all flesh shall see that i the lord have kindled it it shall not be quenched
then said i ah lord god they say of me doth he not speak parables
and the word of the lord came unto me saying
son of man set thy face toward jerusalem and drop thy word toward the holy places and prophesy against the land of israel
and say to the land of israel thus saith the lord behold i am against thee and will draw forth my sword out of his sheath and will cut off from thee the righteous and the wicked
seeing then that i will cut off from thee the righteous and the wicked therefore shall my sword go forth out of his sheath against all flesh from the south to the north
that all flesh may know that i the lord have drawn forth my sword out of his sheath it shall not return any more
sigh therefore thou son of man with the breaking of thy loins and with bitterness sigh before their eyes
and it shall be when they say unto thee wherefore sighest thou that thou shalt answer for the tidings because it cometh and every heart shall melt and all hands shall be feeble and every spirit shall faint and all knees shall be weak as water behold it cometh and shall be brought to pass saith the lord god
again the word of the lord came unto me saying
son of man prophesy and say thus saith the lord say a sword a sword is sharpened and also furbished
it is sharpened to make a sore slaughter it is furbished that it may glitter should we then make mirth it contemneth the rod of my son as every tree
and he hath given it to be furbished that it may be handled this sword is sharpened and it is furbished to give it into the hand of the slayer
cry and howl son of man for it shall be upon my people it shall be upon all the princes of israel terrors by reason of the sword shall be upon my people smite therefore upon thy thigh
because it is a trial and what if the sword contemn even the rod it shall be no more saith the lord god
thou therefore son of man prophesy and smite thine hands together and let the sword be doubled the third time the sword of the slain it is the sword of the great men that are slain which entereth into their privy chambers
i have set the point of the sword against all their gates that their heart may faint and their ruins be multiplied ah it is made bright it is wrapped up for the slaughter
go thee one way or other either on the right hand or on the left whithersoever thy face is set
i will also smite mine hands together and i will cause my fury to rest i the lord have said it
the word of the lord came unto me again saying
also thou son of man appoint thee two ways that the sword of the king of babylon may come both twain shall come forth out of one land and choose thou a place choose it at the head of the way to the city
appoint a way that the sword may come to rabbath of the ammonites and to judah in jerusalem the defenced
for the king of babylon stood at the parting of the way at the head of the two ways to use divination he made his arrows bright he consulted with images he looked in the liver
at his right hand was the divination for jerusalem to appoint captains to open the mouth in the slaughter to lift up the voice with shouting to appoint battering rams against the gates to cast a mount and to build a fort
and it shall be unto them as a false divination in their sight to them that have sworn oaths but he will call to remembrance the iniquity that they may be taken
therefore thus saith the lord god because ye have made your iniquity to be remembered in that your transgressions are discovered so that in all your doings your sins do appear because i say that ye are come to remembrance ye shall be taken with the hand
and thou profane wicked prince of israel whose day is come when iniquity shall have an end
thus saith the lord god remove the diadem and take off the crown this shall not be the same exalt him that is low and abase him that is high
i will overturn overturn overturn it and it shall be no more until he come whose right it is and i will give it him
and thou son of man prophesy and say thus saith the lord god concerning the ammonites and concerning their reproach even say thou the sword the sword is drawn for the slaughter it is furbished to consume because of the glittering
whiles they see vanity unto thee whiles they divine a lie unto thee to bring thee upon the necks of them that are slain of the wicked whose day is come when their iniquity shall have an end
shall i cause it to return into his sheath i will judge thee in the place where thou wast created in the land of thy nativity
and i will pour out mine indignation upon thee i will blow against thee in the fire of my wrath and deliver thee into the hand of brutish men and skilful to destroy
thou shalt be for fuel to the fire thy blood shall be in the midst of the land thou shalt be no more remembered for i the lord have spoken it
moreover the word of the lord came unto me saying
now thou son of man wilt thou judge wilt thou judge the bloody city yea thou shalt shew her all her abominations
then say thou thus saith the lord god the city sheddeth blood in the midst of it that her time may come and maketh idols against herself to defile herself
thou art become guilty in thy blood that thou hast shed and hast defiled thyself in thine idols which thou hast made and thou hast caused thy days to draw near and art come even unto thy years therefore have i made thee a reproach unto the heathen and a mocking to all countries
those that be near and those that be far from thee shall mock thee which art infamous and much vexed
behold the princes of israel every one were in thee to their power to shed blood
in thee have they set light by father and mother in the midst of thee have they dealt by oppression with the stranger in thee have they vexed the fatherless and the widow
thou hast despised mine holy things and hast profaned my sabbaths
in thee are men that carry tales to shed blood and in thee they eat upon the mountains in the midst of thee they commit lewdness
in thee have they discovered their fathers nakedness in thee have they humbled her that was set apart for pollution
and one hath committed abomination with his neighbour's wife and another hath lewdly defiled his daughter in law and another in thee hath humbled his sister his father's daughter
in thee have they taken gifts to shed blood thou hast taken usury and increase and thou hast greedily gained of thy neighbours by extortion and hast forgotten me saith the lord god
behold therefore i have smitten mine hand at thy dishonest gain which thou hast made and at thy blood which hath been in the midst of thee
can thine heart endure or can thine hands be strong in the days that i shall deal with thee i the lord have spoken it and will do it
and i will scatter thee among the heathen and disperse thee in the countries and will consume thy filthiness out of thee
and thou shalt take thine inheritance in thyself in the sight of the heathen and thou shalt know that i am the lord
and the word of the lord came unto me saying
son of man the house of israel is to me become dross all they are brass and tin and iron and lead in the midst of the furnace they are even the dross of silver
therefore thus saith the lord god because ye are all become dross behold therefore i will gather you into the midst of jerusalem
as they gather silver and brass and iron and lead and tin into the midst of the furnace to blow the fire upon it to melt it so will i gather you in mine anger and in my fury and i will leave you there and melt you
yea i will gather you and blow upon you in the fire of my wrath and ye shall be melted in the midst thereof
