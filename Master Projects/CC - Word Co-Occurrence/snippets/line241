regan i cannot think my sister in the least
 would fail her obligation if sir perchance
 she have restrain'd the riots of your followers
 tis on such ground and to such wholesome end
 as clears her from all blame
king lear my curses on her
regan o sir you are old
 nature in you stands on the very verge
 of her confine you should be ruled and led
 by some discretion that discerns your state
 better than you yourself therefore i pray you
 that to our sister you do make return
 say you have wrong'd her sir
king lear ask her forgiveness
 do you but mark how this becomes the house
 dear daughter i confess that i am old
 kneeling
 age is unnecessary on my knees i beg
 that you'll vouchsafe me raiment bed and food'
regan good sir no more these are unsightly tricks
 return you to my sister
king lear rising never regan
 she hath abated me of half my train
 look'd black upon me struck me with her tongue
 most serpentlike upon the very heart
 all the stored vengeances of heaven fall
 on her ingrateful top strike her young bones
 you taking airs with lameness
cornwall fie sir fie
king lear you nimble lightnings dart your blinding flames
 into her scornful eyes infect her beauty
 you fensuck'd fogs drawn by the powerful sun
 to fall and blast her pride
regan o the blest gods so will you wish on me
 when the rash mood is on
king lear no regan thou shalt never have my curse
 thy tenderhefted nature shall not give
 thee o'er to harshness her eyes are fierce but thine
 do comfort and not burn tis not in thee
 to grudge my pleasures to cut off my train
 to bandy hasty words to scant my sizes
 and in conclusion to oppose the bolt
 against my coming in thou better know'st
 the offices of nature bond of childhood
 effects of courtesy dues of gratitude
 thy half o the kingdom hast thou not forgot
 wherein i thee endow'd
regan good sir to the purpose
king lear who put my man i the stocks
 tucket within
cornwall what trumpet's that
regan i know't my sister's this approves her letter
 that she would soon be here
 enter oswald
 is your lady come
king lear this is a slave whose easyborrow'd pride
 dwells in the fickle grace of her he follows
 out varlet from my sight
cornwall what means your grace
king lear who stock'd my servant regan i have good hope
 thou didst not know on't who comes here o heavens
 enter goneril
 if you do love old men if your sweet sway
 allow obedience if yourselves are old
 make it your cause send down and take my part
 to goneril
 art not ashamed to look upon this beard
 o regan wilt thou take her by the hand
goneril why not by the hand sir how have i offended
 all's not offence that indiscretion finds
 and dotage terms so
king lear o sides you are too tough
 will you yet hold how came my man i the stocks
cornwall i set him there sir but his own disorders
 deserved much less advancement
king lear you did you
regan i pray you father being weak seem so
 if till the expiration of your month
 you will return and sojourn with my sister
 dismissing half your train come then to me
 i am now from home and out of that provision
 which shall be needful for your entertainment
king lear return to her and fifty men dismiss'd
 no rather i abjure all roofs and choose
 to wage against the enmity o the air
 to be a comrade with the wolf and owl
 necessity's sharp pinch return with her
 why the hotblooded france that dowerless took
 our youngest born i could as well be brought
 to knee his throne and squirelike pension beg
 to keep base life afoot return with her
 persuade me rather to be slave and sumpter
 to this detested groom
 pointing at oswald
goneril at your choice sir
king lear i prithee daughter do not make me mad
 i will not trouble thee my child farewell
 we'll no more meet no more see one another
 but yet thou art my flesh my blood my daughter
 or rather a disease that's in my flesh
 which i must needs call mine thou art a boil
 a plaguesore an embossed carbuncle
 in my corrupted blood but i'll not chide thee
 let shame come when it will i do not call it
 i do not bid the thunderbearer shoot
 nor tell tales of thee to highjudging jove
 mend when thou canst be better at thy leisure
 i can be patient i can stay with regan
 i and my hundred knights
regan not altogether so
 i look'd not for you yet nor am provided
 for your fit welcome give ear sir to my sister
 for those that mingle reason with your passion
 must be content to think you old and so
 but she knows what she does
king lear is this well spoken
regan i dare avouch it sir what fifty followers
 is it not well what should you need of more
 yea or so many sith that both charge and danger
 speak gainst so great a number how in one house
 should many people under two commands
 hold amity tis hard almost impossible
goneril why might not you my lord receive attendance
 from those that she calls servants or from mine
regan why not my lord if then they chanced to slack you
 we could control them if you will come to me
 for now i spy a dangeri entreat you
 to bring but five and twenty to no more
 will i give place or notice
king lear i gave you all
regan and in good time you gave it
king lear made you my guardians my depositaries
 but kept a reservation to be follow'd
 with such a number what must i come to you
 with five and twenty regan said you so
regan and speak't again my lord no more with me
king lear those wicked creatures yet do look wellfavour'd
 when others are more wicked not being the worst
 stands in some rank of praise
 to goneril
 i'll go with thee
 thy fifty yet doth double five and twenty
 and thou art twice her love
goneril hear me my lord
 what need you five and twenty ten or five
 to follow in a house where twice so many
 have a command to tend you
regan what need one
king lear o reason not the need our basest beggars
 are in the poorest thing superfluous
 allow not nature more than nature needs
 man's life's as cheap as beast's thou art a lady
 if only to go warm were gorgeous
 why nature needs not what thou gorgeous wear'st
 which scarcely keeps thee warm but for true need
 you heavens give me that patience patience i need
 you see me here you gods a poor old man
 as full of grief as age wretched in both
 if it be you that stir these daughters hearts
 against their father fool me not so much
 to bear it tamely touch me with noble anger
 and let not women's weapons waterdrops
 stain my man's cheeks no you unnatural hags
 i will have such revenges on you both
 that all the world shalli will do such things
 what they are yet i know not but they shall be
 the terrors of the earth you think i'll weep
 no i'll not weep
 i have full cause of weeping but this heart
 shall break into a hundred thousand flaws
 or ere i'll weep o fool i shall go mad
 exeunt king lear gloucester kent and fool
 storm and tempest
cornwall let us withdraw twill be a storm
regan this house is little the old man and his people
 cannot be well bestow'd
goneril tis his own blame hath put himself from rest
 and must needs taste his folly
regan for his particular i'll receive him gladly
 but not one follower
goneril so am i purposed
 where is my lord of gloucester
cornwall follow'd the old man forth he is return'd
 reenter gloucester
gloucester the king is in high rage
cornwall whither is he going
gloucester he calls to horse but will i know not whither
cornwall tis best to give him way he leads himself
goneril my lord entreat him by no means to stay
gloucester alack the night comes on and the bleak winds
 do sorely ruffle for many miles about
 there's scarce a bush
regan o sir to wilful men
 the injuries that they themselves procure
 must be their schoolmasters shut up your doors
 he is attended with a desperate train
 and what they may incense him to being apt
 to have his ear abused wisdom bids fear
cornwall shut up your doors my lord tis a wild night
 my regan counsels well come out o the storm
