1chr101 now the philistines fought against israel and the men of israel fled from before the philistines and fell down slain in mount gilboa
1chr102 and the philistines followed hard after saul and after his sons and the philistines slew jonathan and abinadab and malchishua the sons of saul
1chr103 and the battle went sore against saul and the archers hit him and he was wounded of the archers
1chr104 then said saul to his armourbearer draw thy sword and thrust me through therewith lest these uncircumcised come and abuse me but his armourbearer would not for he was sore afraid so saul took a sword and fell upon it
1chr105 and when his armourbearer saw that saul was dead he fell likewise on the sword and died
1chr106 so saul died and his three sons and all his house died together
1chr107 and when all the men of israel that were in the valley saw that they fled and that saul and his sons were dead then they forsook their cities and fled and the philistines came and dwelt in them
1chr108 and it came to pass on the morrow when the philistines came to strip the slain that they found saul and his sons fallen in mount gilboa
1chr109 and when they had stripped him they took his head and his armour and sent into the land of the philistines round about to carry tidings unto their idols and to the people
1chr1010 and they put his armour in the house of their gods and fastened his head in the temple of dagon
1chr1011 and when all jabeshgilead heard all that the philistines had done to saul
1chr1012 they arose all the valiant men and took away the body of saul and the bodies of his sons and brought them to jabesh and buried their bones under the oak in jabesh and fasted seven days
1chr1013 so saul died for his transgression which he committed against the lord even against the word of the lord which he kept not and also for asking counsel of one that had a familiar spirit to enquire of it
1chr1014 and enquired not of the lord therefore he slew him and turned the kingdom unto david the son of jesse
1chr111 then all israel gathered themselves to david unto hebron saying behold we are thy bone and thy flesh
1chr112 and moreover in time past even when saul was king thou wast he that leddest out and broughtest in israel and the lord thy god said unto thee thou shalt feed my people israel and thou shalt be ruler over my people israel
1chr113 therefore came all the elders of israel to the king to hebron and david made a covenant with them in hebron before the lord and they anointed david king over israel according to the word of the lord by samuel
1chr114 and david and all israel went to jerusalem which is jebus where the jebusites were the inhabitants of the land
1chr115 and the inhabitants of jebus said to david thou shalt not come hither nevertheless david took the castle of zion which is the city of david
1chr116 and david said whosoever smiteth the jebusites first shall be chief and captain so joab the son of zeruiah went first up and was chief
1chr117 and david dwelt in the castle therefore they called it the city of david
1chr118 and he built the city round about even from millo round about and joab repaired the rest of the city
1chr119 so david waxed greater and greater for the lord of hosts was with him
1chr1110 these also are the chief of the mighty men whom david had who strengthened themselves with him in his kingdom and with all israel to make him king according to the word of the lord concerning israel
1chr1111 and this is the number of the mighty men whom david had jashobeam an hachmonite the chief of the captains he lifted up his spear against three hundred slain by him at one time
1chr1112 and after him was eleazar the son of dodo the ahohite who was one of the three mighties
1chr1113 he was with david at pasdammim and there the philistines were gathered together to battle where was a parcel of ground full of barley and the people fled from before the philistines
1chr1114 and they set themselves in the midst of that parcel and delivered it and slew the philistines and the lord saved them by a great deliverance
1chr1115 now three of the thirty captains went down to the rock to david into the cave of adullam and the host of the philistines encamped in the valley of rephaim
1chr1116 and david was then in the hold and the philistines garrison was then at bethlehem
1chr1117 and david longed and said oh that one would give me drink of the water of the well of bethlehem that is at the gate
1chr1118 and the three brake through the host of the philistines and drew water out of the well of bethlehem that was by the gate and took it and brought it to david but david would not drink of it but poured it out to the lord
1chr1119 and said my god forbid it me that i should do this thing shall i drink the blood of these men that have put their lives in jeopardy for with the jeopardy of their lives they brought it therefore he would not drink it these things did these three mightiest
1chr1120 and abishai the brother of joab he was chief of the three for lifting up his spear against three hundred he slew them and had a name among the three
1chr1121 of the three he was more honourable than the two for he was their captain howbeit he attained not to the first three
1chr1122 benaiah the son of jehoiada the son of a valiant man of kabzeel who had done many acts he slew two lionlike men of moab also he went down and slew a lion in a pit in a snowy day
1chr1123 and he slew an egyptian a man of great stature five cubits high and in the egyptian's hand was a spear like a weaver's beam and he went down to him with a staff and plucked the spear out of the egyptian's hand and slew him with his own spear
1chr1124 these things did benaiah the son of jehoiada and had the name among the three mighties
1chr1125 behold he was honourable among the thirty but attained not to the first three and david set him over his guard

1chr1215 these are they that went over jordan in the first month when it had overflown all his banks and they put to flight all them of the valleys both toward the east and toward the west
1chr1216 and there came of the children of benjamin and judah to the hold unto david
1chr1217 and david went out to meet them and answered and said unto them if ye be come peaceably unto me to help me mine heart shall be knit unto you but if ye be come to betray me to mine enemies seeing there is no wrong in mine hands the god of our fathers look thereon and rebuke it
1chr1218 then the spirit came upon amasai who was chief of the captains and he said thine are we david and on thy side thou son of jesse peace peace be unto thee and peace be to thine helpers for thy god helpeth thee then david received them and made them captains of the band
1chr1219 and there fell some of manasseh to david when he came with the philistines against saul to battle but they helped them not for the lords of the philistines upon advisement sent him away saying he will fall to his master saul to the jeopardy of our heads
1chr1220 as he went to ziklag there fell to him of manasseh adnah and jozabad and jediael and michael and jozabad and elihu and zilthai captains of the thousands that were of manasseh
1chr1221 and they helped david against the band of the rovers for they were all mighty men of valour and were captains in the host
1chr1222 for at that time day by day there came to david to help him until it was a great host like the host of god
1chr1223 and these are the numbers of the bands that were ready armed to the war and came to david to hebron to turn the kingdom of saul to him according to the word of the lord
1chr1224 the children of judah that bare shield and spear were six thousand and eight hundred ready armed to the war

1chr1230 and of the children of ephraim twenty thousand and eight hundred mighty men of valour famous throughout the house of their fathers
1chr1231 and of the half tribe of manasseh eighteen thousand which were expressed by name to come and make david king
1chr1232 and of the children of issachar which were men that had understanding of the times to know what israel ought to do the heads of them were two hundred and all their brethren were at their commandment
1chr1233 of zebulun such as went forth to battle expert in war with all instruments of war fifty thousand which could keep rank they were not of double heart

1chr1238 all these men of war that could keep rank came with a perfect heart to hebron to make david king over all israel and all the rest also of israel were of one heart to make david king
1chr1239 and there they were with david three days eating and drinking for their brethren had prepared for them
1chr1240 moreover they that were nigh them even unto issachar and zebulun and naphtali brought bread on asses and on camels and on mules and on oxen and meat meal cakes of figs and bunches of raisins and wine and oil and oxen and sheep abundantly for there was joy in israel
1chr131 and david consulted with the captains of thousands and hundreds and with every leader
1chr132 and david said unto all the congregation of israel if it seem good unto you and that it be of the lord our god let us send abroad unto our brethren every where that are left in all the land of israel and with them also to the priests and levites which are in their cities and suburbs that they may gather themselves unto us
1chr133 and let us bring again the ark of our god to us for we enquired not at it in the days of saul
1chr134 and all the congregation said that they would do so for the thing was right in the eyes of all the people
1chr135 so david gathered all israel together from shihor of egypt even unto the entering of hemath to bring the ark of god from kirjathjearim
1chr136 and david went up and all israel to baalah that is to kirjathjearim which belonged to judah to bring up thence the ark of god the lord that dwelleth between the cherubims whose name is called on it
1chr137 and they carried the ark of god in a new cart out of the house of abinadab and uzza and ahio drave the cart
1chr138 and david and all israel played before god with all their might and with singing and with harps and with psalteries and with timbrels and with cymbals and with trumpets
1chr139 and when they came unto the threshingfloor of chidon uzza put forth his hand to hold the ark for the oxen stumbled
1chr1310 and the anger of the lord was kindled against uzza and he smote him because he put his hand to the ark and there he died before god
1chr1311 and david was displeased because the lord had made a breach upon uzza wherefore that place is called perezuzza to this day
1chr1312 and david was afraid of god that day saying how shall i bring the ark of god home to me
1chr1313 so david brought not the ark home to himself to the city of david but carried it aside into the house of obededom the gittite
1chr1314 and the ark of god remained with the family of obededom in his house three months and the lord blessed the house of obededom and all that he had
1chr141 now hiram king of tyre sent messengers to david and timber of cedars with masons and carpenters to build him an house
1chr142 and david perceived that the lord had confirmed him king over israel for his kingdom was lifted up on high because of his people israel
1chr143 and david took more wives at jerusalem and david begat more sons and daughters
1chr144 now these are the names of his children which he had in jerusalem shammua and shobab nathan and solomon
1chr145 and ibhar and elishua and elpalet
1chr146 and nogah and nepheg and japhia
1chr147 and elishama and beeliada and eliphalet
1chr148 and when the philistines heard that david was anointed king over all israel all the philistines went up to seek david and david heard of it and went out against them
1chr149 and the philistines came and spread themselves in the valley of rephaim
1chr1410 and david enquired of god saying shall i go up against the philistines and wilt thou deliver them into mine hand and the lord said unto him go up for i will deliver them into thine hand
1chr1411 so they came up to baalperazim and david smote them there then david said god hath broken in upon mine enemies by mine hand like the breaking forth of waters therefore they called the name of that place baalperazim
1chr1412 and when they had left their gods there david gave a commandment and they were burned with fire
1chr1413 and the philistines yet again spread themselves abroad in the valley
1chr1414 therefore david enquired again of god and god said unto him go not up after them turn away from them and come upon them over against the mulberry trees
1chr1415 and it shall be when thou shalt hear a sound of going in the tops of the mulberry trees that then thou shalt go out to battle for god is gone forth before thee to smite the host of the philistines
1chr1416 david therefore did as god commanded him and they smote the host of the philistines from gibeon even to gazer
1chr1417 and the fame of david went out into all lands and the lord brought the fear of him upon all nations
1chr151 and david made him houses in the city of david and prepared a place for the ark of god and pitched for it a tent
1chr152 then david said none ought to carry the ark of god but the levites for them hath the lord chosen to carry the ark of god and to minister unto him for ever
1chr153 and david gathered all israel together to jerusalem to bring up the ark of the lord unto his place which he had prepared for it
1chr154 and david assembled the children of aaron and the levites
1chr155 of the sons of kohath uriel the chief and his brethren an hundred and twenty
1chr156 of the sons of merari asaiah the chief and his brethren two hundred and twenty
