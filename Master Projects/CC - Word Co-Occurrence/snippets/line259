 as broad and general as the casing air
 but now i am cabin'd cribb'd confined bound in
 to saucy doubts and fears but banquo's safe
first murderer ay my good lord safe in a ditch he bides
 with twenty trenched gashes on his head
 the least a death to nature
macbeth thanks for that
 there the grown serpent lies the worm that's fled
 hath nature that in time will venom breed
 no teeth for the present get thee gone tomorrow
 we'll hear ourselves again
 exit murderer
lady macbeth my royal lord

 tis given with welcome to feed were best at home
 from thence the sauce to meat is ceremony
 meeting were bare without it
macbeth sweet remembrancer
 now good digestion wait on appetite
 and health on both
lennox may't please your highness sit
 the ghost of banquo enters and sits in
 macbeth's place
macbeth here had we now our country's honour roof'd
 were the graced person of our banquo present
 who may i rather challenge for unkindness
 than pity for mischance
ross his absence sir
 lays blame upon his promise please't your highness
 to grace us with your royal company
macbeth the table's full
lennox here is a place reserved sir
macbeth where
lennox here my good lord what is't that moves your highness
macbeth which of you have done this
lords what my good lord
macbeth thou canst not say i did it never shake
 thy gory locks at me
ross gentlemen rise his highness is not well
lady macbeth sit worthy friends my lord is often thus
 and hath been from his youth pray you keep seat
 the fit is momentary upon a thought
 he will again be well if much you note him
 you shall offend him and extend his passion
 feed and regard him not are you a man
macbeth ay and a bold one that dare look on that
 which might appal the devil
lady macbeth o proper stuff
 this is the very painting of your fear
 this is the airdrawn dagger which you said
 led you to duncan o these flaws and starts
 impostors to true fear would well become
 a woman's story at a winter's fire
 authorized by her grandam shame itself
 why do you make such faces when all's done
 you look but on a stool
macbeth prithee see there behold look lo
 how say you
 why what care i if thou canst nod speak too
 if charnelhouses and our graves must send
 those that we bury back our monuments
 shall be the maws of kites
 ghost of banquo vanishes
lady macbeth what quite unmann'd in folly
macbeth if i stand here i saw him
lady macbeth fie for shame
macbeth blood hath been shed ere now i the olden time
 ere human statute purged the gentle weal
 ay and since too murders have been perform'd
 too terrible for the ear the times have been
 that when the brains were out the man would die
 and there an end but now they rise again
 with twenty mortal murders on their crowns
 and push us from our stools this is more strange
 than such a murder is
lady macbeth my worthy lord
 your noble friends do lack you
macbeth i do forget
 do not muse at me my most worthy friends
 i have a strange infirmity which is nothing
 to those that know me come love and health to all
 then i'll sit down give me some wine fill full
 i drink to the general joy o the whole table
 and to our dear friend banquo whom we miss
 would he were here to all and him we thirst
 and all to all
lords our duties and the pledge
 reenter ghost of banquo
macbeth avaunt and quit my sight let the earth hide thee
 thy bones are marrowless thy blood is cold
 thou hast no speculation in those eyes
 which thou dost glare with
lady macbeth think of this good peers
 but as a thing of custom tis no other
 only it spoils the pleasure of the time
macbeth what man dare i dare
 approach thou like the rugged russian bear
 the arm'd rhinoceros or the hyrcan tiger
 take any shape but that and my firm nerves
 shall never tremble or be alive again
 and dare me to the desert with thy sword
 if trembling i inhabit then protest me
 the baby of a girl hence horrible shadow
 unreal mockery hence
 ghost of banquo vanishes
 why so being gone
 i am a man again pray you sit still
lady macbeth you have displaced the mirth broke the good meeting
 with most admired disorder
macbeth can such things be
 and overcome us like a summer's cloud
 without our special wonder you make me strange
 even to the disposition that i owe
 when now i think you can behold such sights
 and keep the natural ruby of your cheeks
 when mine is blanched with fear
ross what sights my lord
lady macbeth i pray you speak not he grows worse and worse
 question enrages him at once good night
 stand not upon the order of your going
 but go at once
lennox good night and better health
 attend his majesty
lady macbeth a kind good night to all
 exeunt all but macbeth and lady macbeth
macbeth it will have blood they say blood will have blood
 stones have been known to move and trees to speak
 augurs and understood relations have
 by magotpies and choughs and rooks brought forth
 the secret'st man of blood what is the night
lady macbeth almost at odds with morning which is which
macbeth how say'st thou that macduff denies his person
 at our great bidding
lady macbeth did you send to him sir
