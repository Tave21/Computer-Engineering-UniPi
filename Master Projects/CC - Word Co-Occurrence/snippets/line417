soothsayer last night the very gods show'd me a vision
 i fast and pray'd for their intelligencethus
 i saw jove's bird the roman eagle wing'd
 from the spongy south to this part of the west
 there vanish'd in the sunbeams which portends
 unless my sins abuse my divination
 success to the roman host
caius lucius dream often so
 and never false soft ho what trunk is here
 without his top the ruin speaks that sometime
 it was a worthy building how a page
 or dead or sleeping on him but dead rather
 for nature doth abhor to make his bed
 with the defunct or sleep upon the dead
 let's see the boy's face
captain he's alive my lord
caius lucius he'll then instruct us of this body young one
 inform us of thy fortunes for it seems
 they crave to be demanded who is this
 thou makest thy bloody pillow or who was he
 that otherwise than noble nature did
 hath alter'd that good picture what's thy interest
 in this sad wreck how came it who is it
 what art thou
imogen i am nothing or if not
 nothing to be were better this was my master
 a very valiant briton and a good
 that here by mountaineers lies slain alas
 there is no more such masters i may wander
 from east to occident cry out for service
 try many all good serve truly never
 find such another master
caius lucius lack good youth
 thou movest no less with thy complaining than
 thy master in bleeding say his name good friend
imogen richard du champ
 aside
 if i do lie and do
 no harm by it though the gods hear i hope
 they'll pardon itsay you sir
caius lucius thy name
imogen fidele sir
caius lucius thou dost approve thyself the very same
 thy name well fits thy faith thy faith thy name
 wilt take thy chance with me i will not say
 thou shalt be so well master'd but be sure
 no less beloved the roman emperor's letters
 sent by a consul to me should not sooner
 than thine own worth prefer thee go with me
imogen i'll follow sir but first an't please the gods
 i'll hide my master from the flies as deep
 as these poor pickaxes can dig and when
 with wild woodleaves and weeds i ha strew'd his grave
 and on it said a century of prayers
 such as i can twice o'er i'll weep and sigh
 and leaving so his service follow you
 so please you entertain me
caius lucius ay good youth
 and rather father thee than master thee
 my friends
 the boy hath taught us manly duties let us
 find out the prettiest daisied plot we can
 and make him with our pikes and partisans
 a grave come arm him boy he is preferr'd
 by thee to us and he shall be interr'd
 as soldiers can be cheerful wipe thine eyes
 some falls are means the happier to arise

act iv
scene iii a room in cymbeline's palace
 enter cymbeline lords pisanio and attendants
cymbeline again and bring me word how tis with her
 exit an attendant
 a fever with the absence of her son
 a madness of which her life's in danger heavens
 how deeply you at once do touch me imogen
 the great part of my comfort gone my queen
 upon a desperate bed and in a time
 when fearful wars point at me her son gone
 so needful for this present it strikes me past
 the hope of comfort but for thee fellow
 who needs must know of her departure and
 dost seem so ignorant we'll enforce it from thee
 by a sharp torture
pisanio sir my life is yours
 i humbly set it at your will but for my mistress
 i nothing know where she remains why gone
 nor when she purposes return beseech your highness
 hold me your loyal servant
first lord good my liege
 the day that she was missing he was here
 i dare be bound he's true and shall perform
 all parts of his subjection loyally for cloten
 there wants no diligence in seeking him
 and will no doubt be found
cymbeline the time is troublesome
 to pisanio
 we'll slip you for a season but our jealousy
 does yet depend
first lord so please your majesty
 the roman legions all from gallia drawn
 are landed on your coast with a supply
 of roman gentlemen by the senate sent
cymbeline now for the counsel of my son and queen
 i am amazed with matter
first lord good my liege
 your preparation can affront no less
 than what you hear of come more for more
 you're ready
 the want is but to put those powers in motion
 that long to move
cymbeline i thank you let's withdraw
 and meet the time as it seeks us we fear not
 what can from italy annoy us but
 we grieve at chances here away
 exeunt all but pisanio
pisanio i heard no letter from my master since
 i wrote him imogen was slain tis strange
 nor hear i from my mistress who did promise
 to yield me often tidings neither know i
 what is betid to cloten but remain
 perplex'd in all the heavens still must work
 wherein i am false i am honest not true to be true
 these present wars shall find i love my country
 even to the note o the king or i'll fall in them
 all other doubts by time let them be clear'd
 fortune brings in some boats that are not steer'd

act iv
scene iv wales before the cave of belarius
 enter belarius guiderius and arviragus
guiderius the noise is round about us
belarius let us from it
arviragus what pleasure sir find we in life to lock it
 from action and adventure
guiderius nay what hope
 have we in hiding us this way the romans
 must or for britons slay us or receive us
 for barbarous and unnatural revolts
 during their use and slay us after
belarius sons
 we'll higher to the mountains there secure us
 to the king's party there's no going newness
 of cloten's deathwe being not known not muster'd
 among the bandsmay drive us to a render
 where we have lived and so extort from's that
 which we have done whose answer would be death
 drawn on with torture
guiderius this is sir a doubt
 in such a time nothing becoming you
 nor satisfying us
arviragus it is not likely
 that when they hear the roman horses neigh
 behold their quarter'd fires have both their eyes
 and ears so cloy'd importantly as now
 that they will waste their time upon our note
 to know from whence we are
belarius o i am known
 of many in the army many years
 though cloten then but young you see not wore him
 from my remembrance and besides the king
 hath not deserved my service nor your loves
 who find in my exile the want of breeding
 the certainty of this hard life aye hopeless
 to have the courtesy your cradle promised
 but to be still hot summer's tamings and
 the shrinking slaves of winter
guiderius than be so
 better to cease to be pray sir to the army
 i and my brother are not known yourself
 so out of thought and thereto so o'ergrown
 cannot be question'd
arviragus by this sun that shines
 i'll thither what thing is it that i never
 did see man die scarce ever look'd on blood
 but that of coward hares hot goats and venison
 never bestrid a horse save one that had
 a rider like myself who ne'er wore rowel
 nor iron on his heel i am ashamed
 to look upon the holy sun to have
 the benefit of his blest beams remaining
 so long a poor unknown
guiderius by heavens i'll go
 if you will bless me sir and give me leave
 i'll take the better care but if you will not
 the hazard therefore due fall on me by
 the hands of romans
arviragus so say i amen
belarius no reason i since of your lives you set
 so slight a valuation should reserve
 my crack'd one to more care have with you boys
 if in your country wars you chance to die
 that is my bed too lads an there i'll lie
 lead lead
 aside
 the time seems long their blood
 thinks scorn
 till it fly out and show them princes born
