 i find myself a traitor with the rest
 for i have given here my soul's consent
 to undeck the pompous body of a king
 made glory base and sovereignty a slave
 proud majesty a subject state a peasant
northumberland my lord
king richard ii no lord of thine thou haught insulting man
 nor no man's lord i have no name no title
 no not that name was given me at the font
 but tis usurp'd alack the heavy day
 that i have worn so many winters out
 and know not now what name to call myself
 o that i were a mockery king of snow
 standing before the sun of bolingbroke
 to melt myself away in waterdrops
 good king great king and yet not greatly good
 an if my word be sterling yet in england
 let it command a mirror hither straight
 that it may show me what a face i have
 since it is bankrupt of his majesty
henry bolingbroke go some of you and fetch a lookingglass
 exit an attendant
northumberland read o'er this paper while the glass doth come
king richard ii fiend thou torment'st me ere i come to hell
henry bolingbroke urge it no more my lord northumberland
northumberland the commons will not then be satisfied
king richard ii they shall be satisfied i'll read enough
 when i do see the very book indeed
 where all my sins are writ and that's myself
 reenter attendant with a glass
 give me the glass and therein will i read
 no deeper wrinkles yet hath sorrow struck
 so many blows upon this face of mine
 and made no deeper wounds o flattering glass
 like to my followers in prosperity
 thou dost beguile me was this face the face
 that every day under his household roof
 did keep ten thousand men was this the face
 that like the sun did make beholders wink
 was this the face that faced so many follies
 and was at last outfaced by bolingbroke
 a brittle glory shineth in this face
 as brittle as the glory is the face
 dashes the glass against the ground
 for there it is crack'd in a hundred shivers
 mark silent king the moral of this sport
 how soon my sorrow hath destroy'd my face
henry bolingbroke the shadow of your sorrow hath destroy'd
 the shadow or your face
king richard ii say that again
 the shadow of my sorrow ha let's see
 tis very true my grief lies all within
 and these external manners of laments
 are merely shadows to the unseen grief
 that swells with silence in the tortured soul
 there lies the substance and i thank thee king
 for thy great bounty that not only givest
 me cause to wail but teachest me the way
 how to lament the cause i'll beg one boon
 and then be gone and trouble you no more
 shall i obtain it
henry bolingbroke name it fair cousin
king richard ii fair cousin i am greater than a king
 for when i was a king my flatterers
 were then but subjects being now a subject
 i have a king here to my flatterer
 being so great i have no need to beg
henry bolingbroke yet ask
king richard ii and shall i have
henry bolingbroke you shall
king richard ii then give me leave to go
henry bolingbroke whither
king richard ii whither you will so i were from your sights
henry bolingbroke go some of you convey him to the tower
king richard ii o good convey conveyers are you all
 that rise thus nimbly by a true king's fall
 exeunt king richard ii some lords and a guard
henry bolingbroke on wednesday next we solemnly set down
 our coronation lords prepare yourselves
 exeunt all except the bishop of carlisle the abbot
 of westminster and duke of aumerle
abbot a woeful pageant have we here beheld
bishop of carlisle the woe's to come the children yet unborn
 shall feel this day as sharp to them as thorn
duke of aumerle you holy clergymen is there no plot
 to rid the realm of this pernicious blot
abbot my lord
 before i freely speak my mind herein
 you shall not only take the sacrament
 to bury mine intents but also to effect
 whatever i shall happen to devise
 i see your brows are full of discontent
 your hearts of sorrow and your eyes of tears
 come home with me to supper and i'll lay
 a plot shall show us all a merry day
 exeunt
 king richard ii
act v
scene i london a street leading to the tower
 enter queen and ladies
queen this way the king will come this is the way
 to julius caesar's illerected tower
 to whose flint bosom my condemned lord
 is doom'd a prisoner by proud bolingbroke
 here let us rest if this rebellious earth
 have any resting for her true king's queen
 enter king richard ii and guard
 but soft but see or rather do not see
 my fair rose wither yet look up behold
 that you in pity may dissolve to dew
 and wash him fresh again with truelove tears
 ah thou the model where old troy did stand
 thou map of honour thou king richard's tomb
 and not king richard thou most beauteous inn
 why should hardfavour'd grief be lodged in thee
 when triumph is become an alehouse guest
king richard ii join not with grief fair woman do not so
 to make my end too sudden learn good soul
 to think our former state a happy dream
 from which awaked the truth of what we are
 shows us but this i am sworn brother sweet
 to grim necessity and he and i
 will keep a league till death hie thee to france
 and cloister thee in some religious house
 our holy lives must win a new world's crown
 which our profane hours here have stricken down
queen what is my richard both in shape and mind
 transform'd and weaken'd hath bolingbroke deposed
 thine intellect hath he been in thy heart
 the lion dying thrusteth forth his paw
 and wounds the earth if nothing else with rage
 to be o'erpower'd and wilt thou pupillike
 take thy correction mildly kiss the rod
 and fawn on rage with base humility
 which art a lion and a king of beasts
king richard ii a king of beasts indeed if aught but beasts
 i had been still a happy king of men
 good sometime queen prepare thee hence for france
 think i am dead and that even here thou takest
 as from my deathbed thy last living leave
 in winter's tedious nights sit by the fire
 with good old folks and let them tell thee tales
 of woeful ages long ago betid
 and ere thou bid good night to quit their griefs
 tell thou the lamentable tale of me
 and send the hearers weeping to their beds
 for why the senseless brands will sympathize
 the heavy accent of thy moving tongue
 and in compassion weep the fire out
 and some will mourn in ashes some coalblack
 for the deposing of a rightful king
 enter northumberland and others
northumberland my lord the mind of bolingbroke is changed
 you must to pomfret not unto the tower
 and madam there is order ta'en for you
 with all swift speed you must away to france
king richard ii northumberland thou ladder wherewithal
 the mounting bolingbroke ascends my throne
 the time shall not be many hours of age
 more than it is ere foul sin gathering head
 shalt break into corruption thou shalt think
 though he divide the realm and give thee half
 it is too little helping him to all
 and he shall think that thou which know'st the way
 to plant unrightful kings wilt know again
 being ne'er so little urged another way
 to pluck him headlong from the usurped throne
 the love of wicked men converts to fear
 that fear to hate and hate turns one or both
 to worthy danger and deserved death
northumberland my guilt be on my head and there an end
 take leave and part for you must part forthwith
king richard ii doubly divorced bad men you violate
 a twofold marriage twixt my crown and me
 and then betwixt me and my married wife
 let me unkiss the oath twixt thee and me
 and yet not so for with a kiss twas made
 part us northumberland i toward the north
 where shivering cold and sickness pines the clime
 my wife to france from whence set forth in pomp
 she came adorned hither like sweet may
 sent back like hallowmas or short'st of day
queen and must we be divided must we part
king richard ii ay hand from hand my love and heart from heart
queen banish us both and send the king with me
northumberland that were some love but little policy
queen then whither he goes thither let me go
king richard ii so two together weeping make one woe
 weep thou for me in france i for thee here
 better far off than near be ne'er the near
 go count thy way with sighs i mine with groans
queen so longest way shall have the longest moans
king richard ii twice for one step i'll groan the way being short
 and piece the way out with a heavy heart
 come come in wooing sorrow let's be brief
 since wedding it there is such length in grief
 one kiss shall stop our mouths and dumbly part
 thus give i mine and thus take i thy heart
queen give me mine own again twere no good part
 to take on me to keep and kill thy heart
