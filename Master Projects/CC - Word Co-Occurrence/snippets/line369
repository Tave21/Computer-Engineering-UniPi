 that he comes not along with her
clown by my troth i take my young lord to be a very
 melancholy man
countess by what observance i pray you
clown why he will look upon his boot and sing mend the
 ruff and sing ask questions and sing pick his
 teeth and sing i know a man that had this trick of
 melancholy sold a goodly manor for a song
countess let me see what he writes and when he means to come
 opening a letter
clown i have no mind to isbel since i was at court our
 old ling and our isbels o the country are nothing
 like your old ling and your isbels o the court
 the brains of my cupid's knocked out and i begin to
 love as an old man loves money with no stomach
countess what have we here

countess reads i have sent you a daughterinlaw she hath
 recovered the king and undone me i have wedded
 her not bedded her and sworn to make the not'
 eternal you shall hear i am run away know it
 before the report come if there be breadth enough
 in the world i will hold a long distance my duty
 to you your unfortunate son
 bertram
 this is not well rash and unbridled boy
 to fly the favours of so good a king
 to pluck his indignation on thy head
 by the misprising of a maid too virtuous
 for the contempt of empire
 reenter clown
clown o madam yonder is heavy news within between two
 soldiers and my young lady
countess what is the matter
clown nay there is some comfort in the news some
 comfort your son will not be killed so soon as i
 thought he would
countess why should he be killed
clown so say i madam if he run away as i hear he does
 the danger is in standing to't that's the loss of
 men though it be the getting of children here

 and after some dispatch in hand at court

 never shall come off and show me a child begotten
 of thy body that i am father to then call me

first gentleman ay madam with the swiftest wing of speed
helena reads till i have no wife i have nothing in france

countess find you that there
helena ay madam
first gentleman tis but the boldness of his hand haply which his
 heart was not consenting to
countess nothing in france until he have no wife
 there's nothing here that is too good for him
 but only she and she deserves a lord
 that twenty such rude boys might tend upon
 and call her hourly mistress who was with him
first gentleman a servant only and a gentleman
 which i have sometime known
countess parolles was it not
first gentleman ay my good lady he
countess a very tainted fellow and full of wickedness
 my son corrupts a wellderived nature
 with his inducement
first gentleman indeed good lady
 the fellow has a deal of that too much
 which holds him much to have
countess you're welcome gentlemen
 i will entreat you when you see my son
 to tell him that his sword can never win
 the honour that he loses more i'll entreat you
 written to bear along

 exeunt countess and gentlemen
helena till i have no wife i have nothing in france'
 nothing in france until he has no wife
 thou shalt have none rousillon none in france
 then hast thou all again poor lord is't i
 that chase thee from thy country and expose
 those tender limbs of thine to the event
 of the nonesparing war and is it i
 that drive thee from the sportive court where thou
 wast shot at with fair eyes to be the mark
 of smoky muskets o you leaden messengers
 that ride upon the violent speed of fire
 fly with false aim move the stillpeering air
 that sings with piercing do not touch my lord
 whoever shoots at him i set him there
 whoever charges on his forward breast
 i am the caitiff that do hold him to't
 and though i kill him not i am the cause
 his death was so effected better twere
 i met the ravin lion when he roar'd
 with sharp constraint of hunger better twere
 that all the miseries which nature owes
 were mine at once no come thou home rousillon
 whence honour but of danger wins a scar
 as oft it loses all i will be gone
 my being here it is that holds thee hence
 shall i stay here to do't no no although
 the air of paradise did fan the house
 and angels officed all i will be gone
 that pitiful rumour may report my flight
 to consolate thine ear come night end day
 for with the dark poor thief i'll steal away
 exit

act iii
scene iv rousillon the count's palace
 enter countess and steward
countess alas and would you take the letter of her
 might you not know she would do as she has done
 by sending me a letter read it again
steward reads
 i am saint jaques pilgrim thither gone
 ambitious love hath so in me offended
 that barefoot plod i the cold ground upon
 with sainted vow my faults to have amended
 write write that from the bloody course of war
 my dearest master your dear son may hie
 bless him at home in peace whilst i from far
 his name with zealous fervor sanctify
 his taken labours bid him me forgive
 i his despiteful juno sent him forth
 from courtly friends with camping foes to live
 where death and danger dogs the heels of worth
 he is too good and fair for death and me
 whom i myself embrace to set him free
countess ah what sharp stings are in her mildest words
 rinaldo you did never lack advice so much
 as letting her pass so had i spoke with her
 i could have well diverted her intents
 which thus she hath prevented
steward pardon me madam
 if i had given you this at overnight
 she might have been o'erta'en and yet she writes
 pursuit would be but vain
countess what angel shall
 bless this unworthy husband he cannot thrive
 unless her prayers whom heaven delights to hear
 and loves to grant reprieve him from the wrath
 of greatest justice write write rinaldo
 to this unworthy husband of his wife
 let every word weigh heavy of her worth
