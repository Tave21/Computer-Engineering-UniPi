and it came to pass that when jeremiah had made an end of speaking unto all the people all the words of the lord their god for which the lord their god had sent him to them even all these words
then spake azariah the son of hoshaiah and johanan the son of kareah and all the proud men saying unto jeremiah thou speakest falsely the lord our god hath not sent thee to say go not into egypt to sojourn there
but baruch the son of neriah setteth thee on against us for to deliver us into the hand of the chaldeans that they might put us to death and carry us away captives into babylon
so johanan the son of kareah and all the captains of the forces and all the people obeyed not the voice of the lord to dwell in the land of judah
but johanan the son of kareah and all the captains of the forces took all the remnant of judah that were returned from all nations whither they had been driven to dwell in the land of judah
even men and women and children and the king's daughters and every person that nebuzaradan the captain of the guard had left with gedaliah the son of ahikam the son of shaphan and jeremiah the prophet and baruch the son of neriah
so they came into the land of egypt for they obeyed not the voice of the lord thus came they even to tahpanhes
then came the word of the lord unto jeremiah in tahpanhes saying
take great stones in thine hand and hide them in the clay in the brickkiln which is at the entry of pharaoh's house in tahpanhes in the sight of the men of judah
and say unto them thus saith the lord of hosts the god of israel behold i will send and take nebuchadrezzar the king of babylon my servant and will set his throne upon these stones that i have hid and he shall spread his royal pavilion over them
and when he cometh he shall smite the land of egypt and deliver such as are for death to death and such as are for captivity to captivity and such as are for the sword to the sword
and i will kindle a fire in the houses of the gods of egypt and he shall burn them and carry them away captives and he shall array himself with the land of egypt as a shepherd putteth on his garment and he shall go forth from thence in peace
he shall break also the images of bethshemesh that is in the land of egypt and the houses of the gods of the egyptians shall he burn with fire
the word that came to jeremiah concerning all the jews which dwell in the land of egypt which dwell at migdol and at tahpanhes and at noph and in the country of pathros saying
thus saith the lord of hosts the god of israel ye have seen all the evil that i have brought upon jerusalem and upon all the cities of judah and behold this day they are a desolation and no man dwelleth therein
because of their wickedness which they have committed to provoke me to anger in that they went to burn incense and to serve other gods whom they knew not neither they ye nor your fathers
howbeit i sent unto you all my servants the prophets rising early and sending them saying oh do not this abominable thing that i hate
but they hearkened not nor inclined their ear to turn from their wickedness to burn no incense unto other gods
wherefore my fury and mine anger was poured forth and was kindled in the cities of judah and in the streets of jerusalem and they are wasted and desolate as at this day
therefore now thus saith the lord the god of hosts the god of israel wherefore commit ye this great evil against your souls to cut off from you man and woman child and suckling out of judah to leave you none to remain
in that ye provoke me unto wrath with the works of your hands burning incense unto other gods in the land of egypt whither ye be gone to dwell that ye might cut yourselves off and that ye might be a curse and a reproach among all the nations of the earth
have ye forgotten the wickedness of your fathers and the wickedness of the kings of judah and the wickedness of their wives and your own wickedness and the wickedness of your wives which they have committed in the land of judah and in the streets of jerusalem
they are not humbled even unto this day neither have they feared nor walked in my law nor in my statutes that i set before you and before your fathers
therefore thus saith the lord of hosts the god of israel behold i will set my face against you for evil and to cut off all judah
and i will take the remnant of judah that have set their faces to go into the land of egypt to sojourn there and they shall all be consumed and fall in the land of egypt they shall even be consumed by the sword and by the famine they shall die from the least even unto the greatest by the sword and by the famine and they shall be an execration and an astonishment and a curse and a reproach
for i will punish them that dwell in the land of egypt as i have punished jerusalem by the sword by the famine and by the pestilence
so that none of the remnant of judah which are gone into the land of egypt to sojourn there shall escape or remain that they should return into the land of judah to the which they have a desire to return to dwell there for none shall return but such as shall escape
then all the men which knew that their wives had burned incense unto other gods and all the women that stood by a great multitude even all the people that dwelt in the land of egypt in pathros answered jeremiah saying
as for the word that thou hast spoken unto us in the name of the lord we will not hearken unto thee
but we will certainly do whatsoever thing goeth forth out of our own mouth to burn incense unto the queen of heaven and to pour out drink offerings unto her as we have done we and our fathers our kings and our princes in the cities of judah and in the streets of jerusalem for then had we plenty of victuals and were well and saw no evil
but since we left off to burn incense to the queen of heaven and to pour out drink offerings unto her we have wanted all things and have been consumed by the sword and by the famine
and when we burned incense to the queen of heaven and poured out drink offerings unto her did we make her cakes to worship her and pour out drink offerings unto her without our men
then jeremiah said unto all the people to the men and to the women and to all the people which had given him that answer saying
the incense that ye burned in the cities of judah and in the streets of jerusalem ye and your fathers your kings and your princes and the people of the land did not the lord remember them and came it not into his mind
so that the lord could no longer bear because of the evil of your doings and because of the abominations which ye have committed therefore is your land a desolation and an astonishment and a curse without an inhabitant as at this day
because ye have burned incense and because ye have sinned against the lord and have not obeyed the voice of the lord nor walked in his law nor in his statutes nor in his testimonies therefore this evil is happened unto you as at this day
moreover jeremiah said unto all the people and to all the women hear the word of the lord all judah that are in the land of egypt
thus saith the lord of hosts the god of israel saying ye and your wives have both spoken with your mouths and fulfilled with your hand saying we will surely perform our vows that we have vowed to burn incense to the queen of heaven and to pour out drink offerings unto her ye will surely accomplish your vows and surely perform your vows
therefore hear ye the word of the lord all judah that dwell in the land of egypt behold i have sworn by my great name saith the lord that my name shall no more be named in the mouth of any man of judah in all the land of egypt saying the lord god liveth
behold i will watch over them for evil and not for good and all the men of judah that are in the land of egypt shall be consumed by the sword and by the famine until there be an end of them
yet a small number that escape the sword shall return out of the land of egypt into the land of judah and all the remnant of judah that are gone into the land of egypt to sojourn there shall know whose words shall stand mine or theirs
and this shall be a sign unto you saith the lord that i will punish you in this place that ye may know that my words shall surely stand against you for evil
thus saith the lord behold i will give pharaohhophra king of egypt into the hand of his enemies and into the hand of them that seek his life as i gave zedekiah king of judah into the hand of nebuchadrezzar king of babylon his enemy and that sought his life
the word that jeremiah the prophet spake unto baruch the son of neriah when he had written these words in a book at the mouth of jeremiah in the fourth year of jehoiakim the son of josiah king of judah saying
thus saith the lord the god of israel unto thee o baruch
thou didst say woe is me now for the lord hath added grief to my sorrow i fainted in my sighing and i find no rest
thus shalt thou say unto him the lord saith thus behold that which i have built will i break down and that which i have planted i will pluck up even this whole land
and seekest thou great things for thyself seek them not for behold i will bring evil upon all flesh saith the lord but thy life will i give unto thee for a prey in all places whither thou goest
the word of the lord which came to jeremiah the prophet against the gentiles
against egypt against the army of pharaohnecho king of egypt which was by the river euphrates in carchemish which nebuchadrezzar king of babylon smote in the fourth year of jehoiakim the son of josiah king of judah
order ye the buckler and shield and draw near to battle
harness the horses and get up ye horsemen and stand forth with your helmets furbish the spears and put on the brigandines
wherefore have i seen them dismayed and turned away back and their mighty ones are beaten down and are fled apace and look not back for fear was round about saith the lord
let not the swift flee away nor the mighty man escape they shall stumble and fall toward the north by the river euphrates
who is this that cometh up as a flood whose waters are moved as the rivers
egypt riseth up like a flood and his waters are moved like the rivers and he saith i will go up and will cover the earth i will destroy the city and the inhabitants thereof
come up ye horses and rage ye chariots and let the mighty men come forth the ethiopians and the libyans that handle the shield and the lydians that handle and bend the bow
for this is the day of the lord god of hosts a day of vengeance that he may avenge him of his adversaries and the sword shall devour and it shall be satiate and made drunk with their blood for the lord god of hosts hath a sacrifice in the north country by the river euphrates
go up into gilead and take balm o virgin the daughter of egypt in vain shalt thou use many medicines for thou shalt not be cured
the nations have heard of thy shame and thy cry hath filled the land for the mighty man hath stumbled against the mighty and they are fallen both together
the word that the lord spake to jeremiah the prophet how nebuchadrezzar king of babylon should come and smite the land of egypt
declare ye in egypt and publish in migdol and publish in noph and in tahpanhes say ye stand fast and prepare thee for the sword shall devour round about thee
why are thy valiant men swept away they stood not because the lord did drive them
he made many to fall yea one fell upon another and they said arise and let us go again to our own people and to the land of our nativity from the oppressing sword
they did cry there pharaoh king of egypt is but a noise he hath passed the time appointed
as i live saith the king whose name is the lord of hosts surely as tabor is among the mountains and as carmel by the sea so shall he come
o thou daughter dwelling in egypt furnish thyself to go into captivity for noph shall be waste and desolate without an inhabitant
egypt is like a very fair heifer but destruction cometh it cometh out of the north
also her hired men are in the midst of her like fatted bullocks for they also are turned back and are fled away together they did not stand because the day of their calamity was come upon them and the time of their visitation
the voice thereof shall go like a serpent for they shall march with an army and come against her with axes as hewers of wood
they shall cut down her forest saith the lord though it cannot be searched because they are more than the grasshoppers and are innumerable
the daughter of egypt shall be confounded she shall be delivered into the hand of the people of the north
the lord of hosts the god of israel saith behold i will punish the multitude of no and pharaoh and egypt with their gods and their kings even pharaoh and all them that trust in him
and i will deliver them into the hand of those that seek their lives and into the hand of nebuchadrezzar king of babylon and into the hand of his servants and afterward it shall be inhabited as in the days of old saith the lord
but fear not thou o my servant jacob and be not dismayed o israel for behold i will save thee from afar off and thy seed from the land of their captivity and jacob shall return and be in rest and at ease and none shall make him afraid
fear thou not o jacob my servant saith the lord for i am with thee for i will make a full end of all the nations whither i have driven thee but i will not make a full end of thee but correct thee in measure yet will i not leave thee wholly unpunished
the word of the lord that came to jeremiah the prophet against the philistines before that pharaoh smote gaza
thus saith the lord behold waters rise up out of the north and shall be an overflowing flood and shall overflow the land and all that is therein the city and them that dwell therein then the men shall cry and all the inhabitants of the land shall howl
at the noise of the stamping of the hoofs of his strong horses at the rushing of his chariots and at the rumbling of his wheels the fathers shall not look back to their children for feebleness of hands
because of the day that cometh to spoil all the philistines and to cut off from tyrus and zidon every helper that remaineth for the lord will spoil the philistines the remnant of the country of caphtor
baldness is come upon gaza ashkelon is cut off with the remnant of their valley how long wilt thou cut thyself
o thou sword of the lord how long will it be ere thou be quiet put up thyself into thy scabbard rest and be still
how can it be quiet seeing the lord hath given it a charge against ashkelon and against the sea shore there hath he appointed it
against moab thus saith the lord of hosts the god of israel woe unto nebo for it is spoiled kiriathaim is confounded and taken misgab is confounded and dismayed
there shall be no more praise of moab in heshbon they have devised evil against it come and let us cut it off from being a nation also thou shalt be cut down o madmen the sword shall pursue thee
a voice of crying shall be from horonaim spoiling and great destruction
moab is destroyed her little ones have caused a cry to be heard
for in the going up of luhith continual weeping shall go up for in the going down of horonaim the enemies have heard a cry of destruction
flee save your lives and be like the heath in the wilderness
for because thou hast trusted in thy works and in thy treasures thou shalt also be taken and chemosh shall go forth into captivity with his priests and his princes together
and the spoiler shall come upon every city and no city shall escape the valley also shall perish and the plain shall be destroyed as the lord hath spoken
give wings unto moab that it may flee and get away for the cities thereof shall be desolate without any to dwell therein
cursed be he that doeth the work of the lord deceitfully and cursed be he that keepeth back his sword from blood
moab hath been at ease from his youth and he hath settled on his lees and hath not been emptied from vessel to vessel neither hath he gone into captivity therefore his taste remained in him and his scent is not changed
therefore behold the days come saith the lord that i will send unto him wanderers that shall cause him to wander and shall empty his vessels and break their bottles
and moab shall be ashamed of chemosh as the house of israel was ashamed of bethel their confidence
how say ye we are mighty and strong men for the war
moab is spoiled and gone up out of her cities and his chosen young men are gone down to the slaughter saith the king whose name is the lord of hosts
the calamity of moab is near to come and his affliction hasteth fast
all ye that are about him bemoan him and all ye that know his name say how is the strong staff broken and the beautiful rod
thou daughter that dost inhabit dibon come down from thy glory and sit in thirst for the spoiler of moab shall come upon thee and he shall destroy thy strong holds
o inhabitant of aroer stand by the way and espy ask him that fleeth and her that escapeth and say what is done
moab is confounded for it is broken down howl and cry tell ye it in arnon that moab is spoiled
and judgment is come upon the plain country upon holon and upon jahazah and upon mephaath
and upon dibon and upon nebo and upon bethdiblathaim
and upon kiriathaim and upon bethgamul and upon bethmeon
and upon kerioth and upon bozrah and upon all the cities of the land of moab far or near
the horn of moab is cut off and his arm is broken saith the lord
make ye him drunken for he magnified himself against the lord moab also shall wallow in his vomit and he also shall be in derision
for was not israel a derision unto thee was he found among thieves for since thou spakest of him thou skippedst for joy
o ye that dwell in moab leave the cities and dwell in the rock and be like the dove that maketh her nest in the sides of the hole's mouth
we have heard the pride of moab he is exceeding proud his loftiness and his arrogancy and his pride and the haughtiness of his heart
i know his wrath saith the lord but it shall not be so his lies shall not so effect it
therefore will i howl for moab and i will cry out for all moab mine heart shall mourn for the men of kirheres
o vine of sibmah i will weep for thee with the weeping of jazer thy plants are gone over the sea they reach even to the sea of jazer the spoiler is fallen upon thy summer fruits and upon thy vintage
and joy and gladness is taken from the plentiful field and from the land of moab and i have caused wine to fail from the winepresses none shall tread with shouting their shouting shall be no shouting
from the cry of heshbon even unto elealeh and even unto jahaz have they uttered their voice from zoar even unto horonaim as an heifer of three years old for the waters also of nimrim shall be desolate
moreover i will cause to cease in moab saith the lord him that offereth in the high places and him that burneth incense to his gods
therefore mine heart shall sound for moab like pipes and mine heart shall sound like pipes for the men of kirheres because the riches that he hath gotten are perished
for every head shall be bald and every beard clipped upon all the hands shall be cuttings and upon the loins sackcloth
there shall be lamentation generally upon all the housetops of moab and in the streets thereof for i have broken moab like a vessel wherein is no pleasure saith the lord
they shall howl saying how is it broken down how hath moab turned the back with shame so shall moab be a derision and a dismaying to all them about him
for thus saith the lord behold he shall fly as an eagle and shall spread his wings over moab
kerioth is taken and the strong holds are surprised and the mighty men's hearts in moab at that day shall be as the heart of a woman in her pangs
and moab shall be destroyed from being a people because he hath magnified himself against the lord
fear and the pit and the snare shall be upon thee o inhabitant of moab saith the lord
he that fleeth from the fear shall fall into the pit and he that getteth up out of the pit shall be taken in the snare for i will bring upon it even upon moab the year of their visitation saith the lord
they that fled stood under the shadow of heshbon because of the force but a fire shall come forth out of heshbon and a flame from the midst of sihon and shall devour the corner of moab and the crown of the head of the tumultuous ones
woe be unto thee o moab the people of chemosh perisheth for thy sons are taken captives and thy daughters captives
yet will i bring again the captivity of moab in the latter days saith the lord thus far is the judgment of moab
concerning the ammonites thus saith the lord hath israel no sons hath he no heir why then doth their king inherit gad and his people dwell in his cities
therefore behold the days come saith the lord that i will cause an alarm of war to be heard in rabbah of the ammonites and it shall be a desolate heap and her daughters shall be burned with fire then shall israel be heir unto them that were his heirs saith the lord
howl o heshbon for ai is spoiled cry ye daughters of rabbah gird you with sackcloth lament and run to and fro by the hedges for their king shall go into captivity and his priests and his princes together
wherefore gloriest thou in the valleys thy flowing valley o backsliding daughter that trusted in her treasures saying who shall come unto me
behold i will bring a fear upon thee saith the lord god of hosts from all those that be about thee and ye shall be driven out every man right forth and none shall gather up him that wandereth
and afterward i will bring again the captivity of the children of ammon saith the lord
concerning edom thus saith the lord of hosts is wisdom no more in teman is counsel perished from the prudent is their wisdom vanished
flee ye turn back dwell deep o inhabitants of dedan for i will bring the calamity of esau upon him the time that i will visit him
if grapegatherers come to thee would they not leave some gleaning grapes if thieves by night they will destroy till they have enough
but i have made esau bare i have uncovered his secret places and he shall not be able to hide himself his seed is spoiled and his brethren and his neighbours and he is not
leave thy fatherless children i will preserve them alive and let thy widows trust in me
for thus saith the lord behold they whose judgment was not to drink of the cup have assuredly drunken and art thou he that shall altogether go unpunished thou shalt not go unpunished but thou shalt surely drink of it
for i have sworn by myself saith the lord that bozrah shall become a desolation a reproach a waste and a curse and all the cities thereof shall be perpetual wastes
i have heard a rumour from the lord and an ambassador is sent unto the heathen saying gather ye together and come against her and rise up to the battle
for lo i will make thee small among the heathen and despised among men
thy terribleness hath deceived thee and the pride of thine heart o thou that dwellest in the clefts of the rock that holdest the height of the hill though thou shouldest make thy nest as high as the eagle i will bring thee down from thence saith the lord
also edom shall be a desolation every one that goeth by it shall be astonished and shall hiss at all the plagues thereof
as in the overthrow of sodom and gomorrah and the neighbour cities thereof saith the lord no man shall abide there neither shall a son of man dwell in it
behold he shall come up like a lion from the swelling of jordan against the habitation of the strong but i will suddenly make him run away from her and who is a chosen man that i may appoint over her for who is like me and who will appoint me the time and who is that shepherd that will stand before me
therefore hear the counsel of the lord that he hath taken against edom and his purposes that he hath purposed against the inhabitants of teman surely the least of the flock shall draw them out surely he shall make their habitations desolate with them
the earth is moved at the noise of their fall at the cry the noise thereof was heard in the red sea
behold he shall come up and fly as the eagle and spread his wings over bozrah and at that day shall the heart of the mighty men of edom be as the heart of a woman in her pangs
concerning damascus hamath is confounded and arpad for they have heard evil tidings they are fainthearted there is sorrow on the sea it cannot be quiet
damascus is waxed feeble and turneth herself to flee and fear hath seized on her anguish and sorrows have taken her as a woman in travail
how is the city of praise not left the city of my joy
therefore her young men shall fall in her streets and all the men of war shall be cut off in that day saith the lord of hosts
and i will kindle a fire in the wall of damascus and it shall consume the palaces of benhadad
concerning kedar and concerning the kingdoms of hazor which nebuchadrezzar king of babylon shall smite thus saith the lord arise ye go up to kedar and spoil the men of the east
their tents and their flocks shall they take away they shall take to themselves their curtains and all their vessels and their camels and they shall cry unto them fear is on every side
flee get you far off dwell deep o ye inhabitants of hazor saith the lord for nebuchadrezzar king of babylon hath taken counsel against you and hath conceived a purpose against you
arise get you up unto the wealthy nation that dwelleth without care saith the lord which have neither gates nor bars which dwell alone
and their camels shall be a booty and the multitude of their cattle a spoil and i will scatter into all winds them that are in the utmost corners and i will bring their calamity from all sides thereof saith the lord
and hazor shall be a dwelling for dragons and a desolation for ever there shall no man abide there nor any son of man dwell in it
the word of the lord that came to jeremiah the prophet against elam in the beginning of the reign of zedekiah king of judah saying
thus saith the lord of hosts behold i will break the bow of elam the chief of their might
and upon elam will i bring the four winds from the four quarters of heaven and will scatter them toward all those winds and there shall be no nation whither the outcasts of elam shall not come
for i will cause elam to be dismayed before their enemies and before them that seek their life and i will bring evil upon them even my fierce anger saith the lord and i will send the sword after them till i have consumed them
and i will set my throne in elam and will destroy from thence the king and the princes saith the lord
but it shall come to pass in the latter days that i will bring again the captivity of elam saith the lord
the word that the lord spake against babylon and against the land of the chaldeans by jeremiah the prophet
declare ye among the nations and publish and set up a standard publish and conceal not say babylon is taken bel is confounded merodach is broken in pieces her idols are confounded her images are broken in pieces
for out of the north there cometh up a nation against her which shall make her land desolate and none shall dwell therein they shall remove they shall depart both man and beast
in those days and in that time saith the lord the children of israel shall come they and the children of judah together going and weeping they shall go and seek the lord their god
they shall ask the way to zion with their faces thitherward saying come and let us join ourselves to the lord in a perpetual covenant that shall not be forgotten
my people hath been lost sheep their shepherds have caused them to go astray they have turned them away on the mountains they have gone from mountain to hill they have forgotten their restingplace
all that found them have devoured them and their adversaries said we offend not because they have sinned against the lord the habitation of justice even the lord the hope of their fathers
remove out of the midst of babylon and go forth out of the land of the chaldeans and be as the he goats before the flocks
for lo i will raise and cause to come up against babylon an assembly of great nations from the north country and they shall set themselves in array against her from thence she shall be taken their arrows shall be as of a mighty expert man none shall return in vain
and chaldea shall be a spoil all that spoil her shall be satisfied saith the lord
because ye were glad because ye rejoiced o ye destroyers of mine heritage because ye are grown fat as the heifer at grass and bellow as bulls
your mother shall be sore confounded she that bare you shall be ashamed behold the hindermost of the nations shall be a wilderness a dry land and a desert
because of the wrath of the lord it shall not be inhabited but it shall be wholly desolate every one that goeth by babylon shall be astonished and hiss at all her plagues
put yourselves in array against babylon round about all ye that bend the bow shoot at her spare no arrows for she hath sinned against the lord
shout against her round about she hath given her hand her foundations are fallen her walls are thrown down for it is the vengeance of the lord take vengeance upon her as she hath done do unto her
cut off the sower from babylon and him that handleth the sickle in the time of harvest for fear of the oppressing sword they shall turn every one to his people and they shall flee every one to his own land
israel is a scattered sheep the lions have driven him away first the king of assyria hath devoured him and last this nebuchadrezzar king of babylon hath broken his bones
therefore thus saith the lord of hosts the god of israel behold i will punish the king of babylon and his land as i have punished the king of assyria
and i will bring israel again to his habitation and he shall feed on carmel and bashan and his soul shall be satisfied upon mount ephraim and gilead
in those days and in that time saith the lord the iniquity of israel shall be sought for and there shall be none and the sins of judah and they shall not be found for i will pardon them whom i reserve
go up against the land of merathaim even against it and against the inhabitants of pekod waste and utterly destroy after them saith the lord and do according to all that i have commanded thee
a sound of battle is in the land and of great destruction
how is the hammer of the whole earth cut asunder and broken how is babylon become a desolation among the nations
i have laid a snare for thee and thou art also taken o babylon and thou wast not aware thou art found and also caught because thou hast striven against the lord
the lord hath opened his armoury and hath brought forth the weapons of his indignation for this is the work of the lord god of hosts in the land of the chaldeans
come against her from the utmost border open her storehouses cast her up as heaps and destroy her utterly let nothing of her be left
slay all her bullocks let them go down to the slaughter woe unto them for their day is come the time of their visitation
the voice of them that flee and escape out of the land of babylon to declare in zion the vengeance of the lord our god the vengeance of his temple
call together the archers against babylon all ye that bend the bow camp against it round about let none thereof escape recompense her according to her work according to all that she hath done do unto her for she hath been proud against the lord against the holy one of israel
therefore shall her young men fall in the streets and all her men of war shall be cut off in that day saith the lord
behold i am against thee o thou most proud saith the lord god of hosts for thy day is come the time that i will visit thee
