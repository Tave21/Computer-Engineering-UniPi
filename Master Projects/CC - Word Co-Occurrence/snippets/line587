 and there i'll rest as after much turmoil
 a blessed soul doth in elysium
lucetta but in what habit will you go along
julia not like a woman for i would prevent
 the loose encounters of lascivious men
 gentle lucetta fit me with such weeds
 as may beseem some wellreputed page
lucetta why then your ladyship must cut your hair
julia no girl i'll knit it up in silken strings
 with twenty oddconceited truelove knots
 to be fantastic may become a youth
 of greater time than i shall show to be
lucetta what fashion madam shall i make your breeches
julia that fits as well as tell me good my lord
 what compass will you wear your farthingale'
 why even what fashion thou best likest lucetta
lucetta you must needs have them with a codpiece madam
julia out out lucetta that would be illfavour'd
lucetta a round hose madam now's not worth a pin
 unless you have a codpiece to stick pins on
julia lucetta as thou lovest me let me have
 what thou thinkest meet and is most mannerly
 but tell me wench how will the world repute me
 for undertaking so unstaid a journey
 i fear me it will make me scandalized
lucetta if you think so then stay at home and go not
julia nay that i will not
lucetta then never dream on infamy but go
 if proteus like your journey when you come
 no matter who's displeased when you are gone
 i fear me he will scarce be pleased withal
julia that is the least lucetta of my fear
 a thousand oaths an ocean of his tears
 and instances of infinite of love
 warrant me welcome to my proteus
lucetta all these are servants to deceitful men
julia base men that use them to so base effect
 but truer stars did govern proteus birth
 his words are bonds his oaths are oracles
 his love sincere his thoughts immaculate
 his tears pure messengers sent from his heart
 his heart as far from fraud as heaven from earth
lucetta pray heaven he prove so when you come to him
julia now as thou lovest me do him not that wrong
 to bear a hard opinion of his truth
 only deserve my love by loving him
 and presently go with me to my chamber
 to take a note of what i stand in need of
 to furnish me upon my longing journey
 all that is mine i leave at thy dispose
 my goods my lands my reputation
 only in lieu thereof dispatch me hence
 come answer not but to it presently
 i am impatient of my tarriance
 exeunt
 the two gentlemen of verona
act iii
scene i milan the duke's palace
 enter duke thurio and proteus
duke sir thurio give us leave i pray awhile
 we have some secrets to confer about
 exit thurio
 now tell me proteus what's your will with me
proteus my gracious lord that which i would discover
 the law of friendship bids me to conceal
 but when i call to mind your gracious favours
 done to me undeserving as i am
 my duty pricks me on to utter that
 which else no worldly good should draw from me
 know worthy prince sir valentine my friend
 this night intends to steal away your daughter
 myself am one made privy to the plot
 i know you have determined to bestow her
 on thurio whom your gentle daughter hates
 and should she thus be stol'n away from you
 it would be much vexation to your age
 thus for my duty's sake i rather chose
 to cross my friend in his intended drift
 than by concealing it heap on your head
 a pack of sorrows which would press you down
 being unprevented to your timeless grave
duke proteus i thank thee for thine honest care
 which to requite command me while i live
 this love of theirs myself have often seen
 haply when they have judged me fast asleep
 and oftentimes have purposed to forbid
 sir valentine her company and my court
 but fearing lest my jealous aim might err
 and so unworthily disgrace the man
 a rashness that i ever yet have shunn'd
 i gave him gentle looks thereby to find
 that which thyself hast now disclosed to me
 and that thou mayst perceive my fear of this
 knowing that tender youth is soon suggested
 i nightly lodge her in an upper tower
 the key whereof myself have ever kept
 and thence she cannot be convey'd away
proteus know noble lord they have devised a mean
 how he her chamberwindow will ascend
 and with a corded ladder fetch her down
 for which the youthful lover now is gone
 and this way comes he with it presently
 where if it please you you may intercept him
 but good my lord do it so cunningly
 that my discovery be not aimed at
 for love of you not hate unto my friend
 hath made me publisher of this pretence
duke upon mine honour he shall never know
 that i had any light from thee of this
proteus adieu my lord sir valentine is coming
 exit
 enter valentine
duke sir valentine whither away so fast
valentine please it your grace there is a messenger
 that stays to bear my letters to my friends
 and i am going to deliver them
duke be they of much import
valentine the tenor of them doth but signify
 my health and happy being at your court
duke nay then no matter stay with me awhile
 i am to break with thee of some affairs
 that touch me near wherein thou must be secret
 tis not unknown to thee that i have sought
 to match my friend sir thurio to my daughter
valentine i know it well my lord and sure the match
 were rich and honourable besides the gentleman
 is full of virtue bounty worth and qualities
 beseeming such a wife as your fair daughter
 cannot your grace win her to fancy him
duke no trust me she is peevish sullen froward
 proud disobedient stubborn lacking duty
 neither regarding that she is my child
 nor fearing me as if i were her father
 and may i say to thee this pride of hers
 upon advice hath drawn my love from her
 and where i thought the remnant of mine age
 should have been cherish'd by her childlike duty
 i now am full resolved to take a wife
 and turn her out to who will take her in
 then let her beauty be her weddingdower
 for me and my possessions she esteems not
valentine what would your grace have me to do in this
duke there is a lady in verona here
 whom i affect but she is nice and coy
 and nought esteems my aged eloquence
 now therefore would i have thee to my tutor
 for long agone i have forgot to court
 besides the fashion of the time is changed
 how and which way i may bestow myself
 to be regarded in her sunbright eye
valentine win her with gifts if she respect not words
 dumb jewels often in their silent kind
 more than quick words do move a woman's mind
duke but she did scorn a present that i sent her
valentine a woman sometimes scorns what best contents her
 send her another never give her o'er
 for scorn at first makes afterlove the more
 if she do frown tis not in hate of you
 but rather to beget more love in you
 if she do chide tis not to have you gone
 for why the fools are mad if left alone
 take no repulse whatever she doth say
 for get you gone she doth not mean away'
 flatter and praise commend extol their graces
 though ne'er so black say they have angels faces
 that man that hath a tongue i say is no man
 if with his tongue he cannot win a woman
duke but she i mean is promised by her friends
 unto a youthful gentleman of worth
 and kept severely from resort of men
 that no man hath access by day to her
valentine why then i would resort to her by night
duke ay but the doors be lock'd and keys kept safe
 that no man hath recourse to her by night
valentine what lets but one may enter at her window
duke her chamber is aloft far from the ground
 and built so shelving that one cannot climb it
 without apparent hazard of his life
valentine why then a ladder quaintly made of cords
 to cast up with a pair of anchoring hooks
 would serve to scale another hero's tower
 so bold leander would adventure it
duke now as thou art a gentleman of blood
 advise me where i may have such a ladder
valentine when would you use it pray sir tell me that
duke this very night for love is like a child
 that longs for every thing that he can come by
valentine by seven o'clock i'll get you such a ladder
duke but hark thee i will go to her alone
 how shall i best convey the ladder thither
valentine it will be light my lord that you may bear it
 under a cloak that is of any length
duke a cloak as long as thine will serve the turn
valentine ay my good lord
duke then let me see thy cloak
 i'll get me one of such another length
valentine why any cloak will serve the turn my lord
duke how shall i fashion me to wear a cloak
 i pray thee let me feel thy cloak upon me
 what letter is this same what's here to silvia'
