 like myself in this let him be whipped that first
 finds it so
 singing
 fools had ne'er less wit in a year
 for wise men are grown foppish
 they know not how their wits to wear
 their manners are so apish
king lear when were you wont to be so full of songs sirrah
fool i have used it nuncle ever since thou madest thy
 daughters thy mothers for when thou gavest them
 the rod and put'st down thine own breeches
 singing
 then they for sudden joy did weep
 and i for sorrow sung
 that such a king should play bopeep
 and go the fools among
 prithee nuncle keep a schoolmaster that can teach
 thy fool to lie i would fain learn to lie
king lear an you lie sirrah we'll have you whipped
fool i marvel what kin thou and thy daughters are
 they'll have me whipped for speaking true thou'lt
 have me whipped for lying and sometimes i am
 whipped for holding my peace i had rather be any
 kind o thing than a fool and yet i would not be
 thee nuncle thou hast pared thy wit o both sides
 and left nothing i the middle here comes one o'
 the parings
 enter goneril
king lear how now daughter what makes that frontlet on
 methinks you are too much of late i the frown
fool thou wast a pretty fellow when thou hadst no need to
 care for her frowning now thou art an o without a
 figure i am better than thou art now i am a fool
 thou art nothing
 to goneril
 yes forsooth i will hold my tongue so your face
 bids me though you say nothing mum mum
 he that keeps nor crust nor crum
 weary of all shall want some
 pointing to king lear
 that's a shealed peascod
goneril not only sir this your alllicensed fool
 but other of your insolent retinue
 do hourly carp and quarrel breaking forth
 in rank and nottobe endured riots sir
 i had thought by making this well known unto you
 to have found a safe redress but now grow fearful
 by what yourself too late have spoke and done
 that you protect this course and put it on
 by your allowance which if you should the fault
 would not scape censure nor the redresses sleep
 which in the tender of a wholesome weal
 might in their working do you that offence
 which else were shame that then necessity
 will call discreet proceeding
fool for you trow nuncle
 the hedgesparrow fed the cuckoo so long
 that it's had it head bit off by it young
 so out went the candle and we were left darkling
king lear are you our daughter
goneril come sir
 i would you would make use of that good wisdom
 whereof i know you are fraught and put away
 these dispositions that of late transform you
 from what you rightly are
fool may not an ass know when the cart
 draws the horse whoop jug i love thee
king lear doth any here know me this is not lear
 doth lear walk thus speak thus where are his eyes
 either his notion weakens his discernings
 are lethargiedha waking tis not so
 who is it that can tell me who i am
fool lear's shadow
king lear i would learn that for by the
 marks of sovereignty knowledge and reason
 i should be false persuaded i had daughters
fool which they will make an obedient father
king lear your name fair gentlewoman
goneril this admiration sir is much o the savour
 of other your new pranks i do beseech you
 to understand my purposes aright
 as you are old and reverend you should be wise
 here do you keep a hundred knights and squires
 men so disorder'd so debosh'd and bold
 that this our court infected with their manners
 shows like a riotous inn epicurism and lust
 make it more like a tavern or a brothel
 than a graced palace the shame itself doth speak
 for instant remedy be then desired
 by her that else will take the thing she begs
 a little to disquantity your train
 and the remainder that shall still depend
 to be such men as may besort your age
 and know themselves and you
king lear darkness and devils
 saddle my horses call my train together
 degenerate bastard i'll not trouble thee
 yet have i left a daughter
goneril you strike my people and your disorder'd rabble
 make servants of their betters
 enter albany
king lear woe that too late repents
 to albany
 o sir are you come
 is it your will speak sir prepare my horses
 ingratitude thou marblehearted fiend
 more hideous when thou show'st thee in a child
 than the seamonster
albany pray sir be patient
king lear to goneril detested kite thou liest
 my train are men of choice and rarest parts
 that all particulars of duty know
 and in the most exact regard support
 the worships of their name o most small fault
 how ugly didst thou in cordelia show
 that like an engine wrench'd my frame of nature
 from the fix'd place drew from heart all love
 and added to the gall o lear lear lear
 beat at this gate that let thy folly in
 striking his head
 and thy dear judgment out go go my people
albany my lord i am guiltless as i am ignorant
 of what hath moved you
king lear it may be so my lord
 hear nature hear dear goddess hear
 suspend thy purpose if thou didst intend
 to make this creature fruitful
 into her womb convey sterility
 dry up in her the organs of increase
 and from her derogate body never spring
 a babe to honour her if she must teem
 create her child of spleen that it may live
 and be a thwart disnatured torment to her
 let it stamp wrinkles in her brow of youth
 with cadent tears fret channels in her cheeks
 turn all her mother's pains and benefits
 to laughter and contempt that she may feel
 how sharper than a serpent's tooth it is
 to have a thankless child away away
 exit
albany now gods that we adore whereof comes this
goneril never afflict yourself to know the cause
 but let his disposition have that scope
 that dotage gives it
 reenter king lear
king lear what fifty of my followers at a clap
 within a fortnight
albany what's the matter sir
king lear i'll tell thee
 to goneril
 life and death i am ashamed
 that thou hast power to shake my manhood thus
 that these hot tears which break from me perforce
 should make thee worth them blasts and fogs upon thee
 the untented woundings of a father's curse
 pierce every sense about thee old fond eyes
 beweep this cause again i'll pluck ye out
 and cast you with the waters that you lose
 to temper clay yea it is come to this
 let is be so yet have i left a daughter
 who i am sure is kind and comfortable
 when she shall hear this of thee with her nails
 she'll flay thy wolvish visage thou shalt find
 that i'll resume the shape which thou dost think
 i have cast off for ever thou shalt
 i warrant thee
 exeunt king lear kent and attendants
goneril do you mark that my lord
albany i cannot be so partial goneril
 to the great love i bear you
goneril pray you content what oswald ho
 to the fool
 you sir more knave than fool after your master
fool nuncle lear nuncle lear tarry and take the fool
 with thee
 a fox when one has caught her
 and such a daughter
 should sure to the slaughter
 if my cap would buy a halter
 so the fool follows after
 exit
goneril this man hath had good counsela hundred knights
 tis politic and safe to let him keep
 at point a hundred knights yes that on every dream
 each buzz each fancy each complaint dislike
 he may enguard his dotage with their powers
 and hold our lives in mercy oswald i say
albany well you may fear too far
goneril safer than trust too far
 let me still take away the harms i fear
 not fear still to be taken i know his heart
 what he hath utter'd i have writ my sister
 if she sustain him and his hundred knights
 when i have show'd the unfitness
 reenter oswald
 how now oswald
 what have you writ that letter to my sister
oswald yes madam
goneril take you some company and away to horse
 inform her full of my particular fear
