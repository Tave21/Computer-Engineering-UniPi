 reenter patroclus
nestor no achilles with him
ulysses the elephant hath joints but none for courtesy
 his legs are legs for necessity not for flexure
patroclus achilles bids me say he is much sorry
 if any thing more than your sport and pleasure
 did move your greatness and this noble state
 to call upon him he hopes it is no other
 but for your health and your digestion sake
 and afterdinner's breath
agamemnon hear you patroclus
 we are too well acquainted with these answers
 but his evasion wing'd thus swift with scorn
 cannot outfly our apprehensions
 much attribute he hath and much the reason
 why we ascribe it to him yet all his virtues
 not virtuously on his own part beheld
 do in our eyes begin to lose their gloss
 yea like fair fruit in an unwholesome dish
 are like to rot untasted go and tell him
 we come to speak with him and you shall not sin
 if you do say we think him overproud
 and underhonest in selfassumption greater
 than in the note of judgment and worthier
 than himself
 here tend the savage strangeness he puts on
 disguise the holy strength of their command
 and underwrite in an observing kind
 his humorous predominance yea watch
 his pettish lunes his ebbs his flows as if
 the passage and whole carriage of this action
 rode on his tide go tell him this and add
 that if he overhold his price so much
 we'll none of him but let him like an engine
 not portable lie under this report
 bring action hither this cannot go to war
 a stirring dwarf we do allowance give
 before a sleeping giant tell him so
patroclus i shall and bring his answer presently
 exit
agamemnon in second voice we'll not be satisfied
 we come to speak with him ulysses enter you
 exit ulysses
ajax what is he more than another
agamemnon no more than what he thinks he is
ajax is he so much do you not think he thinks himself a
 better man than i am
agamemnon no question
ajax will you subscribe his thought and say he is
agamemnon no noble ajax you are as strong as valiant as
 wise no less noble much more gentle and altogether
 more tractable
ajax why should a man be proud how doth pride grow i
 know not what pride is
agamemnon your mind is the clearer ajax and your virtues the
 fairer he that is proud eats up himself pride is
 his own glass his own trumpet his own chronicle
 and whatever praises itself but in the deed devours
 the deed in the praise
ajax i do hate a proud man as i hate the engendering of toads
nestor yet he loves himself is't not strange
 aside
 reenter ulysses
ulysses achilles will not to the field tomorrow
agamemnon what's his excuse
ulysses he doth rely on none
 but carries on the stream of his dispose
 without observance or respect of any
 in will peculiar and in selfadmission
agamemnon why will he not upon our fair request
 untent his person and share the air with us
ulysses things small as nothing for request's sake only
 he makes important possess'd he is with greatness
 and speaks not to himself but with a pride
 that quarrels at selfbreath imagined worth
 holds in his blood such swoln and hot discourse
 that twixt his mental and his active parts
 kingdom'd achilles in commotion rages
 and batters down himself what should i say
 he is so plaguy proud that the deathtokens of it
 cry no recovery'
agamemnon let ajax go to him
 dear lord go you and greet him in his tent
 tis said he holds you well and will be led
 at your request a little from himself
ulysses o agamemnon let it not be so
 we'll consecrate the steps that ajax makes
 when they go from achilles shall the proud lord
 that bastes his arrogance with his own seam
 and never suffers matter of the world
 enter his thoughts save such as do revolve
 and ruminate himself shall he be worshipp'd
 of that we hold an idol more than he
 no this thrice worthy and right valiant lord
 must not so stale his palm nobly acquired
 nor by my will assubjugate his merit
 as amply titled as achilles is
 by going to achilles
 that were to enlard his fat already pride
 and add more coals to cancer when he burns
 with entertaining great hyperion
 this lord go to him jupiter forbid
 and say in thunder achilles go to him'
nestor aside to diomedes o this is well he rubs the
 vein of him
diomedes aside to nestor and how his silence drinks up
 this applause
ajax if i go to him with my armed fist i'll pash him o'er the face
agamemnon o no you shall not go
ajax an a be proud with me i'll pheeze his pride
 let me go to him
ulysses not for the worth that hangs upon our quarrel
ajax a paltry insolent fellow
nestor how he describes himself
ajax can he not be sociable
ulysses the raven chides blackness
ajax i'll let his humours blood
agamemnon he will be the physician that should be the patient
ajax an all men were o my mind
ulysses wit would be out of fashion
ajax a should not bear it so a should eat swords first
 shall pride carry it
nestor an twould you'ld carry half
ulysses a would have ten shares
ajax i will knead him i'll make him supple
nestor he's not yet through warm force him with praises
 pour in pour in his ambition is dry
ulysses to agamemnon my lord you feed too much on this dislike
nestor our noble general do not do so
diomedes you must prepare to fight without achilles
ulysses why tis this naming of him does him harm
 here is a manbut tis before his face
 i will be silent
nestor wherefore should you so
 he is not emulous as achilles is
ulysses know the whole world he is as valiant
ajax a whoreson dog that shall pelter thus with us
 would he were a trojan
nestor what a vice were it in ajax now
ulysses if he were proud
diomedes or covetous of praise
ulysses ay or surly borne
diomedes or strange or selfaffected
ulysses thank the heavens lord thou art of sweet composure
 praise him that got thee she that gave thee suck
 famed be thy tutor and thy parts of nature
 thrice famed beyond all erudition
 but he that disciplined thy arms to fight
 let mars divide eternity in twain
 and give him half and for thy vigour
 bullbearing milo his addition yield
 to sinewy ajax i will not praise thy wisdom
 which like a bourn a pale a shore confines
 thy spacious and dilated parts here's nestor
 instructed by the antiquary times
 he must he is he cannot but be wise
 put pardon father nestor were your days
 as green as ajax and your brain so temper'd
 you should not have the eminence of him
 but be as ajax
ajax shall i call you father
nestor ay my good son
diomedes be ruled by him lord ajax
ulysses there is no tarrying here the hart achilles
 keeps thicket please it our great general
 to call together all his state of war
 fresh kings are come to troy tomorrow
 we must with all our main of power stand fast
 and here's a lordcome knights from east to west
 and cull their flower ajax shall cope the best
agamemnon go we to council let achilles sleep
 light boats sail swift though greater hulks draw deep
