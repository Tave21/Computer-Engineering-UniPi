laertes upon my life lamond
king claudius the very same
laertes i know him well he is the brooch indeed
 and gem of all the nation
king claudius he made confession of you
 and gave you such a masterly report
 for art and exercise in your defence
 and for your rapier most especially
 that he cried out twould be a sight indeed
 if one could match you the scrimers of their nation
 he swore had had neither motion guard nor eye
 if you opposed them sir this report of his
 did hamlet so envenom with his envy
 that he could nothing do but wish and beg
 your sudden coming o'er to play with him
 now out of this
laertes what out of this my lord
king claudius laertes was your father dear to you
 or are you like the painting of a sorrow
 a face without a heart
laertes why ask you this
king claudius not that i think you did not love your father
 but that i know love is begun by time
 and that i see in passages of proof
 time qualifies the spark and fire of it
 there lives within the very flame of love
 a kind of wick or snuff that will abate it
 and nothing is at a like goodness still
 for goodness growing to a plurisy
 dies in his own too much that we would do
 we should do when we would for this would changes
 and hath abatements and delays as many
 as there are tongues are hands are accidents
 and then this should is like a spendthrift sigh
 that hurts by easing but to the quick o the ulcer
 hamlet comes back what would you undertake
 to show yourself your father's son in deed
 more than in words
laertes to cut his throat i the church
king claudius no place indeed should murder sanctuarize
 revenge should have no bounds but good laertes
 will you do this keep close within your chamber
 hamlet return'd shall know you are come home
 we'll put on those shall praise your excellence
 and set a double varnish on the fame
 the frenchman gave you bring you in fine together
 and wager on your heads he being remiss
 most generous and free from all contriving
 will not peruse the foils so that with ease
 or with a little shuffling you may choose
 a sword unbated and in a pass of practise
 requite him for your father
laertes i will do't
 and for that purpose i'll anoint my sword
 i bought an unction of a mountebank
 so mortal that but dip a knife in it
 where it draws blood no cataplasm so rare
 collected from all simples that have virtue
 under the moon can save the thing from death
 that is but scratch'd withal i'll touch my point
 with this contagion that if i gall him slightly
 it may be death
king claudius let's further think of this
 weigh what convenience both of time and means
 may fit us to our shape if this should fail
 and that our drift look through our bad performance
 twere better not assay'd therefore this project
 should have a back or second that might hold
 if this should blast in proof soft let me see
 we'll make a solemn wager on your cunnings i ha't
 when in your motion you are hot and dry
 as make your bouts more violent to that end
 and that he calls for drink i'll have prepared him
 a chalice for the nonce whereon but sipping
 if he by chance escape your venom'd stuck
 our purpose may hold there
 enter queen gertrude
 how now sweet queen
queen gertrude one woe doth tread upon another's heel
 so fast they follow your sister's drown'd laertes
laertes drown'd o where
queen gertrude there is a willow grows aslant a brook
 that shows his hoar leaves in the glassy stream
 there with fantastic garlands did she come
 of crowflowers nettles daisies and long purples
 that liberal shepherds give a grosser name
 but our cold maids do dead men's fingers call them
 there on the pendent boughs her coronet weeds
 clambering to hang an envious sliver broke
 when down her weedy trophies and herself
 fell in the weeping brook her clothes spread wide
 and mermaidlike awhile they bore her up
 which time she chanted snatches of old tunes
 as one incapable of her own distress
 or like a creature native and indued
 unto that element but long it could not be
 till that her garments heavy with their drink
 pull'd the poor wretch from her melodious lay
 to muddy death
laertes alas then she is drown'd
queen gertrude drown'd drown'd
laertes too much of water hast thou poor ophelia
 and therefore i forbid my tears but yet
 it is our trick nature her custom holds
 let shame say what it will when these are gone
 the woman will be out adieu my lord
 i have a speech of fire that fain would blaze
 but that this folly douts it
 exit
king claudius let's follow gertrude
 how much i had to do to calm his rage
 now fear i this will give it start again
 therefore let's follow
 exeunt
 hamlet
act v
scene i a churchyard
 enter two clowns with spades &c
first clown is she to be buried in christian burial that
 wilfully seeks her own salvation
second clown i tell thee she is and therefore make her grave
 straight the crowner hath sat on her and finds it
 christian burial
first clown how can that be unless she drowned herself in her
 own defence
second clown why tis found so
first clown it must be se offendendo it cannot be else for
 here lies the point if i drown myself wittingly
 it argues an act and an act hath three branches it
 is to act to do to perform argal she drowned
 herself wittingly
second clown nay but hear you goodman delver
first clown give me leave here lies the water good here
 stands the man good if the man go to this water
 and drown himself it is will he nill he he
 goesmark you that but if the water come to him
 and drown him he drowns not himself argal he
 that is not guilty of his own death shortens not his own life
second clown but is this law
first clown ay marry is't crowner's quest law
second clown will you ha the truth on't if this had not been
 a gentlewoman she should have been buried out o'
 christian burial
first clown why there thou say'st and the more pity that
 great folk should have countenance in this world to
 drown or hang themselves more than their even
 christian come my spade there is no ancient
 gentleman but gardeners ditchers and gravemakers
 they hold up adam's profession
second clown was he a gentleman
first clown he was the first that ever bore arms
second clown why he had none
first clown what art a heathen how dost thou understand the
 scripture the scripture says adam digged'
 could he dig without arms i'll put another
 question to thee if thou answerest me not to the
 purpose confess thyself
second clown go to
first clown what is he that builds stronger than either the
 mason the shipwright or the carpenter
second clown the gallowsmaker for that frame outlives a
 thousand tenants
first clown i like thy wit well in good faith the gallows
 does well but how does it well it does well to
 those that do in now thou dost ill to say the
 gallows is built stronger than the church argal
 the gallows may do well to thee to't again come
second clown who builds stronger than a mason a shipwright or
 a carpenter'
first clown ay tell me that and unyoke
second clown marry now i can tell
first clown to't
second clown mass i cannot tell
 enter hamlet and horatio at a distance
first clown cudgel thy brains no more about it for your dull
 ass will not mend his pace with beating and when
 you are asked this question next say a
 gravemaker the houses that he makes last till
 doomsday go get thee to yaughan fetch me a
 stoup of liquor
 exit second clown
 he digs and sings
 in youth when i did love did love
 methought it was very sweet
 to contract o the time for ah my behove
 o methought there was nothing meet
hamlet has this fellow no feeling of his business that he
 sings at gravemaking
horatio custom hath made it in him a property of easiness
hamlet tis e'en so the hand of little employment hath
 the daintier sense
first clown sings
 but age with his stealing steps
 hath claw'd me in his clutch
 and hath shipped me intil the land
 as if i had never been such
 throws up a skull
hamlet that skull had a tongue in it and could sing once
 how the knave jowls it to the ground as if it were
 cain's jawbone that did the first murder it
