camillo i think this coming summer the king of sicilia
 means to pay bohemia the visitation which he justly owes him
archidamus wherein our entertainment shall shame us we will be
 justified in our loves for indeed
camillo beseech you
archidamus verily i speak it in the freedom of my knowledge
 we cannot with such magnificencein so rarei know
 not what to say we will give you sleepy drinks
 that your senses unintelligent of our insufficience
 may though they cannot praise us as little accuse
 us
camillo you pay a great deal too dear for what's given freely
archidamus believe me i speak as my understanding instructs me
 and as mine honesty puts it to utterance
camillo sicilia cannot show himself overkind to bohemia
 they were trained together in their childhoods and
 there rooted betwixt them then such an affection
 which cannot choose but branch now since their
 more mature dignities and royal necessities made
 separation of their society their encounters
 though not personal have been royally attorneyed
 with interchange of gifts letters loving
 embassies that they have seemed to be together
 though absent shook hands as over a vast and
 embraced as it were from the ends of opposed
 winds the heavens continue their loves
archidamus i think there is not in the world either malice or
 matter to alter it you have an unspeakable
 comfort of your young prince mamillius it is a
 gentleman of the greatest promise that ever came
 into my note
camillo i very well agree with you in the hopes of him it
 is a gallant child one that indeed physics the
 subject makes old hearts fresh they that went on
 crutches ere he was born desire yet their life to
 see him a man
archidamus would they else be content to die
camillo yes if there were no other excuse why they should
 desire to live
archidamus if the king had no son they would desire to live
 on crutches till he had one
 exeunt
 the winter's tale
act i
scene ii a room of state in the same
 enter leontes hermione mamillius
 polixenes camillo and attendants
polixenes nine changes of the watery star hath been
 the shepherd's note since we have left our throne
 without a burthen time as long again
 would be find up my brother with our thanks
 and yet we should for perpetuity
 go hence in debt and therefore like a cipher
 yet standing in rich place i multiply
 with one we thank you many thousands moe
 that go before it
leontes stay your thanks a while
 and pay them when you part
polixenes sir that's tomorrow
 i am question'd by my fears of what may chance
 or breed upon our absence that may blow
 no sneaping winds at home to make us say
 this is put forth too truly besides i have stay'd
 to tire your royalty
leontes we are tougher brother
 than you can put us to't
polixenes no longer stay
leontes one sevennight longer
polixenes very sooth tomorrow
leontes we'll part the time between's then and in that
 i'll no gainsaying
polixenes press me not beseech you so
 there is no tongue that moves none none i the world
 so soon as yours could win me so it should now
 were there necessity in your request although
 twere needful i denied it my affairs
 do even drag me homeward which to hinder
 were in your love a whip to me my stay
 to you a charge and trouble to save both
 farewell our brother
leontes tonguetied our queen
 speak you
hermione i had thought sir to have held my peace until
 you have drawn oaths from him not to stay you sir
 charge him too coldly tell him you are sure
 all in bohemia's well this satisfaction
 the bygone day proclaim'd say this to him
 he's beat from his best ward
leontes well said hermione
hermione to tell he longs to see his son were strong
 but let him say so then and let him go
 but let him swear so and he shall not stay
 we'll thwack him hence with distaffs
 yet of your royal presence i'll adventure
 the borrow of a week when at bohemia
 you take my lord i'll give him my commission
 to let him there a month behind the gest
 prefix'd for's parting yet good deed leontes
 i love thee not a jar o the clock behind
 what ladyshe her lord you'll stay
polixenes no madam
hermione nay but you will
polixenes i may not verily
hermione verily
 you put me off with limber vows but i
 though you would seek to unsphere the
 stars with oaths
 should yet say sir no going verily
 you shall not go a lady's verily s
 as potent as a lord's will you go yet
 force me to keep you as a prisoner
 not like a guest so you shall pay your fees
 when you depart and save your thanks how say you
 my prisoner or my guest by your dread verily'
 one of them you shall be
polixenes your guest then madam
 to be your prisoner should import offending
 which is for me less easy to commit
 than you to punish
hermione not your gaoler then
 but your kind hostess come i'll question you
 of my lord's tricks and yours when you were boys
 you were pretty lordings then
polixenes we were fair queen
 two lads that thought there was no more behind
 but such a day tomorrow as today
 and to be boy eternal
hermione was not my lord
 the verier wag o the two
polixenes we were as twinn'd lambs that did frisk i the sun
 and bleat the one at the other what we changed
 was innocence for innocence we knew not
 the doctrine of illdoing nor dream'd
 that any did had we pursued that life
 and our weak spirits ne'er been higher rear'd
 with stronger blood we should have answer'd heaven
 boldly not guilty the imposition clear'd
 hereditary ours
hermione by this we gather
 you have tripp'd since
polixenes o my most sacred lady
 temptations have since then been born to's for
 in those unfledged days was my wife a girl
 your precious self had then not cross'd the eyes
 of my young playfellow
hermione grace to boot
 of this make no conclusion lest you say
 your queen and i are devils yet go on
 the offences we have made you do we'll answer
 if you first sinn'd with us and that with us
 you did continue fault and that you slipp'd not
 with any but with us
leontes is he won yet
hermione he'll stay my lord
leontes at my request he would not
 hermione my dearest thou never spokest
 to better purpose
hermione never
leontes never but once
hermione what have i twice said well when was't before
 i prithee tell me cram's with praise and make's
 as fat as tame things one good deed dying tongueless
 slaughters a thousand waiting upon that
 our praises are our wages you may ride's
 with one soft kiss a thousand furlongs ere
 with spur we beat an acre but to the goal
 my last good deed was to entreat his stay
 what was my first it has an elder sister
 or i mistake you o would her name were grace
 but once before i spoke to the purpose when
 nay let me have't i long
leontes why that was when
 three crabbed months had sour'd themselves to death
 ere i could make thee open thy white hand
 and clap thyself my love then didst thou utter
 i am yours for ever'
hermione tis grace indeed
 why lo you now i have spoke to the purpose twice
 the one for ever earn'd a royal husband
 the other for some while a friend
leontes aside too hot too hot
 to mingle friendship far is mingling bloods
 i have tremor cordis on me my heart dances
 but not for joy not joy this entertainment
 may a free face put on derive a liberty
 from heartiness from bounty fertile bosom
 and well become the agent t may i grant
 but to be paddling palms and pinching fingers
 as now they are and making practised smiles
 as in a lookingglass and then to sigh as twere
 the mort o the deer o that is entertainment
 my bosom likes not nor my brows mamillius
 art thou my boy
mamillius ay my good lord
leontes i fecks
 why that's my bawcock what hast
 smutch'd thy nose
 they say it is a copy out of mine come captain
 we must be neat not neat but cleanly captain
 and yet the steer the heifer and the calf
