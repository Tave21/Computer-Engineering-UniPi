2ki105 and he that was over the house and he that was over the city the elders also and the bringers up of the children sent to jehu saying we are thy servants and will do all that thou shalt bid us we will not make any king do thou that which is good in thine eyes
2ki106 then he wrote a letter the second time to them saying if ye be mine and if ye will hearken unto my voice take ye the heads of the men your master's sons and come to me to jezreel by to morrow this time now the king's sons being seventy persons were with the great men of the city which brought them up
2ki107 and it came to pass when the letter came to them that they took the king's sons and slew seventy persons and put their heads in baskets and sent him them to jezreel
2ki108 and there came a messenger and told him saying they have brought the heads of the king's sons and he said lay ye them in two heaps at the entering in of the gate until the morning
2ki109 and it came to pass in the morning that he went out and stood and said to all the people ye be righteous behold i conspired against my master and slew him but who slew all these
2ki1010 know now that there shall fall unto the earth nothing of the word of the lord which the lord spake concerning the house of ahab for the lord hath done that which he spake by his servant elijah
2ki1011 so jehu slew all that remained of the house of ahab in jezreel and all his great men and his kinsfolks and his priests until he left him none remaining
2ki1012 and he arose and departed and came to samaria and as he was at the shearing house in the way
2ki1013 jehu met with the brethren of ahaziah king of judah and said who are ye and they answered we are the brethren of ahaziah and we go down to salute the children of the king and the children of the queen
2ki1014 and he said take them alive and they took them alive and slew them at the pit of the shearing house even two and forty men neither left he any of them
2ki1015 and when he was departed thence he lighted on jehonadab the son of rechab coming to meet him and he saluted him and said to him is thine heart right as my heart is with thy heart and jehonadab answered it is if it be give me thine hand and he gave him his hand and he took him up to him into the chariot
2ki1016 and he said come with me and see my zeal for the lord so they made him ride in his chariot
2ki1017 and when he came to samaria he slew all that remained unto ahab in samaria till he had destroyed him according to the saying of the lord which he spake to elijah
2ki1018 and jehu gathered all the people together and said unto them ahab served baal a little but jehu shall serve him much
2ki1019 now therefore call unto me all the prophets of baal all his servants and all his priests let none be wanting for i have a great sacrifice to do to baal whosoever shall be wanting he shall not live but jehu did it in subtilty to the intent that he might destroy the worshippers of baal
2ki1020 and jehu said proclaim a solemn assembly for baal and they proclaimed it
2ki1021 and jehu sent through all israel and all the worshippers of baal came so that there was not a man left that came not and they came into the house of baal and the house of baal was full from one end to another
2ki1022 and he said unto him that was over the vestry bring forth vestments for all the worshippers of baal and he brought them forth vestments
2ki1023 and jehu went and jehonadab the son of rechab into the house of baal and said unto the worshippers of baal search and look that there be here with you none of the servants of the lord but the worshippers of baal only
2ki1024 and when they went in to offer sacrifices and burnt offerings jehu appointed fourscore men without and said if any of the men whom i have brought into your hands escape he that letteth him go his life shall be for the life of him
2ki1025 and it came to pass as soon as he had made an end of offering the burnt offering that jehu said to the guard and to the captains go in and slay them let none come forth and they smote them with the edge of the sword and the guard and the captains cast them out and went to the city of the house of baal
2ki1026 and they brought forth the images out of the house of baal and burned them
2ki1027 and they brake down the image of baal and brake down the house of baal and made it a draught house unto this day
2ki1028 thus jehu destroyed baal out of israel
2ki1029 howbeit from the sins of jeroboam the son of nebat who made israel to sin jehu departed not from after them to wit the golden calves that were in bethel and that were in dan
2ki1030 and the lord said unto jehu because thou hast done well in executing that which is right in mine eyes and hast done unto the house of ahab according to all that was in mine heart thy children of the fourth generation shall sit on the throne of israel
2ki1031 but jehu took no heed to walk in the law of the lord god of israel with all his heart for he departed not from the sins of jeroboam which made israel to sin
2ki1032 in those days the lord began to cut israel short and hazael smote them in all the coasts of israel
2ki1033 from jordan eastward all the land of gilead the gadites and the reubenites and the manassites from aroer which is by the river arnon even gilead and bashan
2ki1034 now the rest of the acts of jehu and all that he did and all his might are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of israel
2ki1035 and jehu slept with his fathers and they buried him in samaria and jehoahaz his son reigned in his stead
2ki1036 and the time that jehu reigned over israel in samaria was twenty and eight years
2ki111 and when athaliah the mother of ahaziah saw that her son was dead she arose and destroyed all the seed royal
2ki112 but jehosheba the daughter of king joram sister of ahaziah took joash the son of ahaziah and stole him from among the king's sons which were slain and they hid him even him and his nurse in the bedchamber from athaliah so that he was not slain
2ki113 and he was with her hid in the house of the lord six years and athaliah did reign over the land
2ki114 and the seventh year jehoiada sent and fetched the rulers over hundreds with the captains and the guard and brought them to him into the house of the lord and made a covenant with them and took an oath of them in the house of the lord and shewed them the king's son
2ki115 and he commanded them saying this is the thing that ye shall do a third part of you that enter in on the sabbath shall even be keepers of the watch of the king's house
2ki116 and a third part shall be at the gate of sur and a third part at the gate behind the guard so shall ye keep the watch of the house that it be not broken down
2ki117 and two parts of all you that go forth on the sabbath even they shall keep the watch of the house of the lord about the king
2ki118 and ye shall compass the king round about every man with his weapons in his hand and he that cometh within the ranges let him be slain and be ye with the king as he goeth out and as he cometh in
2ki119 and the captains over the hundreds did according to all things that jehoiada the priest commanded and they took every man his men that were to come in on the sabbath with them that should go out on the sabbath and came to jehoiada the priest
2ki1110 and to the captains over hundreds did the priest give king david's spears and shields that were in the temple of the lord
2ki1111 and the guard stood every man with his weapons in his hand round about the king from the right corner of the temple to the left corner of the temple along by the altar and the temple
2ki1112 and he brought forth the king's son and put the crown upon him and gave him the testimony and they made him king and anointed him and they clapped their hands and said god save the king
2ki1113 and when athaliah heard the noise of the guard and of the people she came to the people into the temple of the lord
2ki1114 and when she looked behold the king stood by a pillar as the manner was and the princes and the trumpeters by the king and all the people of the land rejoiced and blew with trumpets and athaliah rent her clothes and cried treason treason
2ki1115 but jehoiada the priest commanded the captains of the hundreds the officers of the host and said unto them have her forth without the ranges and him that followeth her kill with the sword for the priest had said let her not be slain in the house of the lord
2ki1116 and they laid hands on her and she went by the way by the which the horses came into the king's house and there was she slain
2ki1117 and jehoiada made a covenant between the lord and the king and the people that they should be the lord's people between the king also and the people
2ki1118 and all the people of the land went into the house of baal and brake it down his altars and his images brake they in pieces thoroughly and slew mattan the priest of baal before the altars and the priest appointed officers over the house of the lord
2ki1119 and he took the rulers over hundreds and the captains and the guard and all the people of the land and they brought down the king from the house of the lord and came by the way of the gate of the guard to the king's house and he sat on the throne of the kings
2ki1120 and all the people of the land rejoiced and the city was in quiet and they slew athaliah with the sword beside the king's house
2ki1121 seven years old was jehoash when he began to reign
2ki121 in the seventh year of jehu jehoash began to reign and forty years reigned he in jerusalem and his mother's name was zibiah of beersheba
2ki122 and jehoash did that which was right in the sight of the lord all his days wherein jehoiada the priest instructed him
2ki123 but the high places were not taken away the people still sacrificed and burnt incense in the high places
2ki124 and jehoash said to the priests all the money of the dedicated things that is brought into the house of the lord even the money of every one that passeth the account the money that every man is set at and all the money that cometh into any man's heart to bring into the house of the lord
2ki125 let the priests take it to them every man of his acquaintance and let them repair the breaches of the house wheresoever any breach shall be found
2ki126 but it was so that in the three and twentieth year of king jehoash the priests had not repaired the breaches of the house
2ki127 then king jehoash called for jehoiada the priest and the other priests and said unto them why repair ye not the breaches of the house now therefore receive no more money of your acquaintance but deliver it for the breaches of the house
2ki128 and the priests consented to receive no more money of the people neither to repair the breaches of the house
2ki129 but jehoiada the priest took a chest and bored a hole in the lid of it and set it beside the altar on the right side as one cometh into the house of the lord and the priests that kept the door put therein all the money that was brought into the house of the lord
2ki1210 and it was so when they saw that there was much money in the chest that the king's scribe and the high priest came up and they put up in bags and told the money that was found in the house of the lord
2ki1211 and they gave the money being told into the hands of them that did the work that had the oversight of the house of the lord and they laid it out to the carpenters and builders that wrought upon the house of the lord
2ki1212 and to masons and hewers of stone and to buy timber and hewed stone to repair the breaches of the house of the lord and for all that was laid out for the house to repair it
2ki1213 howbeit there were not made for the house of the lord bowls of silver snuffers basons trumpets any vessels of gold or vessels of silver of the money that was brought into the house of the lord
2ki1214 but they gave that to the workmen and repaired therewith the house of the lord
2ki1215 moreover they reckoned not with the men into whose hand they delivered the money to be bestowed on workmen for they dealt faithfully
2ki1216 the trespass money and sin money was not brought into the house of the lord it was the priests'
2ki1217 then hazael king of syria went up and fought against gath and took it and hazael set his face to go up to jerusalem
2ki1218 and jehoash king of judah took all the hallowed things that jehoshaphat and jehoram and ahaziah his fathers kings of judah had dedicated and his own hallowed things and all the gold that was found in the treasures of the house of the lord and in the king's house and sent it to hazael king of syria and he went away from jerusalem
2ki1219 and the rest of the acts of joash and all that he did are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of judah
2ki1220 and his servants arose and made a conspiracy and slew joash in the house of millo which goeth down to silla
2ki1221 for jozachar the son of shimeath and jehozabad the son of shomer his servants smote him and he died and they buried him with his fathers in the city of david and amaziah his son reigned in his stead
2ki131 in the three and twentieth year of joash the son of ahaziah king of judah jehoahaz the son of jehu began to reign over israel in samaria and reigned seventeen years
2ki132 and he did that which was evil in the sight of the lord and followed the sins of jeroboam the son of nebat which made israel to sin he departed not therefrom
2ki133 and the anger of the lord was kindled against israel and he delivered them into the hand of hazael king of syria and into the hand of benhadad the son of hazael all their days
2ki134 and jehoahaz besought the lord and the lord hearkened unto him for he saw the oppression of israel because the king of syria oppressed them
2ki135 and the lord gave israel a saviour so that they went out from under the hand of the syrians and the children of israel dwelt in their tents as beforetime
2ki136 nevertheless they departed not from the sins of the house of jeroboam who made israel sin but walked therein and there remained the grove also in samaria
2ki137 neither did he leave of the people to jehoahaz but fifty horsemen and ten chariots and ten thousand footmen for the king of syria had destroyed them and had made them like the dust by threshing
2ki138 now the rest of the acts of jehoahaz and all that he did and his might are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of israel
2ki139 and jehoahaz slept with his fathers and they buried him in samaria and joash his son reigned in his stead
2ki1310 in the thirty and seventh year of joash king of judah began jehoash the son of jehoahaz to reign over israel in samaria and reigned sixteen years
2ki1311 and he did that which was evil in the sight of the lord he departed not from all the sins of jeroboam the son of nebat who made israel sin but he walked therein
2ki1312 and the rest of the acts of joash and all that he did and his might wherewith he fought against amaziah king of judah are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of israel
2ki1313 and joash slept with his fathers and jeroboam sat upon his throne and joash was buried in samaria with the kings of israel
2ki1314 now elisha was fallen sick of his sickness whereof he died and joash the king of israel came down unto him and wept over his face and said o my father my father the chariot of israel and the horsemen thereof
2ki1315 and elisha said unto him take bow and arrows and he took unto him bow and arrows
2ki1316 and he said to the king of israel put thine hand upon the bow and he put his hand upon it and elisha put his hands upon the king's hands
2ki1317 and he said open the window eastward and he opened it then elisha said shoot and he shot and he said the arrow of the lord's deliverance and the arrow of deliverance from syria for thou shalt smite the syrians in aphek till thou have consumed them
2ki1318 and he said take the arrows and he took them and he said unto the king of israel smite upon the ground and he smote thrice and stayed
2ki1319 and the man of god was wroth with him and said thou shouldest have smitten five or six times then hadst thou smitten syria till thou hadst consumed it whereas now thou shalt smite syria but thrice
2ki1320 and elisha died and they buried him and the bands of the moabites invaded the land at the coming in of the year
2ki1321 and it came to pass as they were burying a man that behold they spied a band of men and they cast the man into the sepulchre of elisha and when the man was let down and touched the bones of elisha he revived and stood up on his feet
2ki1322 but hazael king of syria oppressed israel all the days of jehoahaz
2ki1323 and the lord was gracious unto them and had compassion on them and had respect unto them because of his covenant with abraham isaac and jacob and would not destroy them neither cast he them from his presence as yet
2ki1324 so hazael king of syria died and benhadad his son reigned in his stead
2ki1325 and jehoash the son of jehoahaz took again out of the hand of benhadad the son of hazael the cities which he had taken out of the hand of jehoahaz his father by war three times did joash beat him and recovered the cities of israel
2ki141 in the second year of joash son of jehoahaz king of israel reigned amaziah the son of joash king of judah
2ki142 he was twenty and five years old when he began to reign and reigned twenty and nine years in jerusalem and his mother's name was jehoaddan of jerusalem
2ki143 and he did that which was right in the sight of the lord yet not like david his father he did according to all things as joash his father did
2ki144 howbeit the high places were not taken away as yet the people did sacrifice and burnt incense on the high places
2ki145 and it came to pass as soon as the kingdom was confirmed in his hand that he slew his servants which had slain the king his father
2ki146 but the children of the murderers he slew not according unto that which is written in the book of the law of moses wherein the lord commanded saying the fathers shall not be put to death for the children nor the children be put to death for the fathers but every man shall be put to death for his own sin
2ki147 he slew of edom in the valley of salt ten thousand and took selah by war and called the name of it joktheel unto this day
2ki148 then amaziah sent messengers to jehoash the son of jehoahaz son of jehu king of israel saying come let us look one another in the face
2ki149 and jehoash the king of israel sent to amaziah king of judah saying the thistle that was in lebanon sent to the cedar that was in lebanon saying give thy daughter to my son to wife and there passed by a wild beast that was in lebanon and trode down the thistle
2ki1410 thou hast indeed smitten edom and thine heart hath lifted thee up glory of this and tarry at home for why shouldest thou meddle to thy hurt that thou shouldest fall even thou and judah with thee
2ki1411 but amaziah would not hear therefore jehoash king of israel went up and he and amaziah king of judah looked one another in the face at bethshemesh which belongeth to judah
2ki1412 and judah was put to the worse before israel and they fled every man to their tents
2ki1413 and jehoash king of israel took amaziah king of judah the son of jehoash the son of ahaziah at bethshemesh and came to jerusalem and brake down the wall of jerusalem from the gate of ephraim unto the corner gate four hundred cubits
2ki1414 and he took all the gold and silver and all the vessels that were found in the house of the lord and in the treasures of the king's house and hostages and returned to samaria
2ki1415 now the rest of the acts of jehoash which he did and his might and how he fought with amaziah king of judah are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of israel
2ki1416 and jehoash slept with his fathers and was buried in samaria with the kings of israel and jeroboam his son reigned in his stead
2ki1417 and amaziah the son of joash king of judah lived after the death of jehoash son of jehoahaz king of israel fifteen years
2ki1418 and the rest of the acts of amaziah are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of judah
2ki1419 now they made a conspiracy against him in jerusalem and he fled to lachish but they sent after him to lachish and slew him there
2ki1420 and they brought him on horses and he was buried at jerusalem with his fathers in the city of david
2ki1421 and all the people of judah took azariah which was sixteen years old and made him king instead of his father amaziah
2ki1422 he built elath and restored it to judah after that the king slept with his fathers
2ki1423 in the fifteenth year of amaziah the son of joash king of judah jeroboam the son of joash king of israel began to reign in samaria and reigned forty and one years
2ki1424 and he did that which was evil in the sight of the lord he departed not from all the sins of jeroboam the son of nebat who made israel to sin
2ki1425 he restored the coast of israel from the entering of hamath unto the sea of the plain according to the word of the lord god of israel which he spake by the hand of his servant jonah the son of amittai the prophet which was of gathhepher
2ki1426 for the lord saw the affliction of israel that it was very bitter for there was not any shut up nor any left nor any helper for israel
2ki1427 and the lord said not that he would blot out the name of israel from under heaven but he saved them by the hand of jeroboam the son of joash
2ki1428 now the rest of the acts of jeroboam and all that he did and his might how he warred and how he recovered damascus and hamath which belonged to judah for israel are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of israel
2ki1429 and jeroboam slept with his fathers even with the kings of israel and zachariah his son reigned in his stead

2ki1512 this was the word of the lord which he spake unto jehu saying thy sons shall sit on the throne of israel unto the fourth generation and so it came to pass
2ki1513 shallum the son of jabesh began to reign in the nine and thirtieth year of uzziah king of judah and he reigned a full month in samaria
2ki1514 for menahem the son of gadi went up from tirzah and came to samaria and smote shallum the son of jabesh in samaria and slew him and reigned in his stead
2ki1515 and the rest of the acts of shallum and his conspiracy which he made behold they are written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of israel

2ki1537 in those days the lord began to send against judah rezin the king of syria and pekah the son of remaliah
2ki1538 and jotham slept with his fathers and was buried with his fathers in the city of david his father and ahaz his son reigned in his stead
2ki161 in the seventeenth year of pekah the son of remaliah ahaz the son of jotham king of judah began to reign
2ki162 twenty years old was ahaz when he began to reign and reigned sixteen years in jerusalem and did not that which was right in the sight of the lord his god like david his father
2ki163 but he walked in the way of the kings of israel yea and made his son to pass through the fire according to the abominations of the heathen whom the lord cast out from before the children of israel
2ki164 and he sacrificed and burnt incense in the high places and on the hills and under every green tree
2ki165 then rezin king of syria and pekah son of remaliah king of israel came up to jerusalem to war and they besieged ahaz but could not overcome him
2ki166 at that time rezin king of syria recovered elath to syria and drave the jews from elath and the syrians came to elath and dwelt there unto this day
2ki167 so ahaz sent messengers to tiglathpileser king of assyria saying i am thy servant and thy son come up and save me out of the hand of the king of syria and out of the hand of the king of israel which rise up against me
2ki168 and ahaz took the silver and gold that was found in the house of the lord and in the treasures of the king's house and sent it for a present to the king of assyria

2ki1617 and king ahaz cut off the borders of the bases and removed the laver from off them and took down the sea from off the brasen oxen that were under it and put it upon a pavement of stones
2ki1618 and the covert for the sabbath that they had built in the house and the king's entry without turned he from the house of the lord for the king of assyria
2ki1619 now the rest of the acts of ahaz which he did are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of judah
2ki1620 and ahaz slept with his fathers and was buried with his fathers in the city of david and hezekiah his son reigned in his stead
2ki171 in the twelfth year of ahaz king of judah began hoshea the son of elah to reign in samaria over israel nine years
2ki172 and he did that which was evil in the sight of the lord but not as the kings of israel that were before him
2ki173 against him came up shalmaneser king of assyria and hoshea became his servant and gave him presents
2ki174 and the king of assyria found conspiracy in hoshea for he had sent messengers to so king of egypt and brought no present to the king of assyria as he had done year by year therefore the king of assyria shut him up and bound him in prison
2ki175 then the king of assyria came up throughout all the land and went up to samaria and besieged it three years
2ki176 in the ninth year of hoshea the king of assyria took samaria and carried israel away into assyria and placed them in halah and in habor by the river of gozan and in the cities of the medes
2ki177 for so it was that the children of israel had sinned against the lord their god which had brought them up out of the land of egypt from under the hand of pharaoh king of egypt and had feared other gods
2ki178 and walked in the statutes of the heathen whom the lord cast out from before the children of israel and of the kings of israel which they had made
2ki179 and the children of israel did secretly those things that were not right against the lord their god and they built them high places in all their cities from the tower of the watchmen to the fenced city
2ki1710 and they set them up images and groves in every high hill and under every green tree
2ki1711 and there they burnt incense in all the high places as did the heathen whom the lord carried away before them and wrought wicked things to provoke the lord to anger
2ki1712 for they served idols whereof the lord had said unto them ye shall not do this thing
2ki1713 yet the lord testified against israel and against judah by all the prophets and by all the seers saying turn ye from your evil ways and keep my commandments and my statutes according to all the law which i commanded your fathers and which i sent to you by my servants the prophets
2ki1714 notwithstanding they would not hear but hardened their necks like to the neck of their fathers that did not believe in the lord their god
