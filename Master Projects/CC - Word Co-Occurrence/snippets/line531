 foul hill my master riding behind my mistress
curtis both of one horse

 under her horse thou shouldst have heard in how
 miry a place how she was bemoiled how he left her
 with the horse upon her how he beat me because
 her horse stumbled how she waded through the dirt
 to pluck him off me how he swore how she prayed
 that never prayed before how i cried how the
 horses ran away how her bridle was burst how i
 lost my crupper with many things of worthy memory
 which now shall die in oblivion and thou return
 unexperienced to thy grave

 find when he comes home but what talk i of this

 exeunt
 reenter servants severally
nathaniel peter didst ever see the like
peter he kills her in her own humour
 reenter curtis
grumio where is he
curtis in her chamber making a sermon of continency to her
 and rails and swears and rates that she poor soul
 knows not which way to stand to look to speak
 and sits as one newrisen from a dream
 away away for he is coming hither
 exeunt
 reenter petruchio
petruchio thus have i politicly begun my reign
 and tis my hope to end successfully
 my falcon now is sharp and passing empty
 and till she stoop she must not be fullgorged
 for then she never looks upon her lure
 another way i have to man my haggard
 to make her come and know her keeper's call
 that is to watch her as we watch these kites
 that bate and beat and will not be obedient
 she eat no meat today nor none shall eat
 last night she slept not nor tonight she shall not
 as with the meat some undeserved fault
 i'll find about the making of the bed
 and here i'll fling the pillow there the bolster
 this way the coverlet another way the sheets
 ay and amid this hurly i intend
 that all is done in reverend care of her
