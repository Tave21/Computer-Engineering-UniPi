 the anointed sovereign of sighs and groans
 liege of all loiterers and malcontents
 dread prince of plackets king of codpieces
 sole imperator and great general
 of trotting paritorso my little heart

 and wear his colours like a tumbler's hoop
 what i i love i sue i seek a wife
 a woman that is like a german clock
 still arepairing ever out of frame
 and never going aright being a watch
 but being watch'd that it may still go right
 nay to be perjured which is worst of all
 and among three to love the worst of all
 a wightly wanton with a velvet brow
 with two pitchballs stuck in her face for eyes
 ay and by heaven one that will do the deed
 though argus were her eunuch and her guard
 and i to sigh for her to watch for her
 to pray for her go to it is a plague
 that cupid will impose for my neglect
 of his almighty dreadful little might
 well i will love write sigh pray sue and groan
 some men must love my lady and some joan

 love's labours lost
act iv
scene i the same
 enter the princess and her train a forester
 boyet rosaline maria and katharine
princess was that the king that spurred his horse so hard
 against the steep uprising of the hill
boyet i know not but i think it was not he
princess whoe'er a was a show'd a mounting mind
 well lords today we shall have our dispatch
 on saturday we will return to france
 then forester my friend where is the bush
 that we must stand and play the murderer in
forester hereby upon the edge of yonder coppice
 a stand where you may make the fairest shoot
princess i thank my beauty i am fair that shoot
 and thereupon thou speak'st the fairest shoot
forester pardon me madam for i meant not so
princess what what first praise me and again say no
 o shortlived pride not fair alack for woe
forester yes madam fair
princess nay never paint me now
 where fair is not praise cannot mend the brow
 here good my glass take this for telling true
 fair payment for foul words is more than due
forester nothing but fair is that which you inherit
princess see see my beauty will be saved by merit
 o heresy in fair fit for these days
 a giving hand though foul shall have fair praise
 but come the bow now mercy goes to kill
 and shooting well is then accounted ill
 thus will i save my credit in the shoot
 not wounding pity would not let me do't
 if wounding then it was to show my skill
 that more for praise than purpose meant to kill
 and out of question so it is sometimes
 glory grows guilty of detested crimes
 when for fame's sake for praise an outward part
 we bend to that the working of the heart
 as i for praise alone now seek to spill
 the poor deer's blood that my heart means no ill
boyet do not curst wives hold that selfsovereignty
 only for praise sake when they strive to be
 lords o'er their lords
princess only for praise and praise we may afford
 to any lady that subdues a lord
boyet here comes a member of the commonwealth
 enter costard
costard god digyouden all pray you which is the head lady
princess thou shalt know her fellow by the rest that have no heads
costard which is the greatest lady the highest
princess the thickest and the tallest
costard the thickest and the tallest it is so truth is truth
 an your waist mistress were as slender as my wit
 one o these maids girdles for your waist should be fit
 are not you the chief woman you are the thickest here
princess what's your will sir what's your will
costard i have a letter from monsieur biron to one lady rosaline
princess o thy letter thy letter he's a good friend of mine
 stand aside good bearer boyet you can carve
 break up this capon
boyet i am bound to serve
 this letter is mistook it importeth none here
 it is writ to jaquenetta
princess we will read it i swear
 break the neck of the wax and every one give ear
 reads
boyet by heaven that thou art fair is most infallible
 true that thou art beauteous truth itself that
 thou art lovely more fairer than fair beautiful
 than beauteous truer than truth itself have
 commiseration on thy heroical vassal the
 magnanimous and most illustrate king cophetua set
 eye upon the pernicious and indubitate beggar
 zenelophon and he it was that might rightly say
 veni vidi vici which to annothanize in the
 vulgaro base and obscure vulgarvidelicet he
 came saw and overcame he came one saw two
 overcame three who came the king why did he
 come to see why did he see to overcome to
 whom came he to the beggar what saw he the
 beggar who overcame he the beggar the
 conclusion is victory on whose side the king's
 the captive is enriched on whose side the
 beggar's the catastrophe is a nuptial on whose
 side the king's no on both in one or one in
 both i am the king for so stands the comparison
 thou the beggar for so witnesseth thy lowliness
 shall i command thy love i may shall i enforce
 thy love i could shall i entreat thy love i
