he saith she is immodest blames her miss
what follows more she murders with a kiss
even as an empty eagle sharp by fast
tires with her beak on feathers flesh and bone
shaking her wings devouring all in haste
till either gorge be stuff'd or prey be gone
even so she kissed his brow his cheek his chin
and where she ends she doth anew begin
forced to content but never to obey
panting he lies and breatheth in her face
she feedeth on the steam as on a prey
and calls it heavenly moisture air of grace
wishing her cheeks were gardens full of flowers
so they were dew'd with such distilling showers
look how a bird lies tangled in a net
so fasten'd in her arms adonis lies
pure shame and awed resistance made him fret
which bred more beauty in his angry eyes
rain added to a river that is rank
perforce will force it overflow the bank
still she entreats and prettily entreats
for to a pretty ear she tunes her tale
still is he sullen still he lours and frets
'twixt crimson shame and anger ashypale
being red she loves him best and being white
her best is better'd with a more delight
look how he can she cannot choose but love
and by her fair immortal hand she swears
from his soft bosom never to remove
till he take truce with her contending tears
which long have rain'd making her cheeks all wet
and one sweet kiss shall pay this countless debt
upon this promise did he raise his chin
like a divedapper peering through a wave
who being look'd on ducks as quickly in
so offers he to give what she did crave
but when her lips were ready for his pay
he winks and turns his lips another way
never did passenger in summer's heat
more thirst for drink than she for this good turn
her help she sees but help she cannot get
she bathes in water yet her fire must burn
'o pity gan she cry flinthearted boy
'tis but a kiss i beg why art thou coy
'i have been woo'd as i entreat thee now
even by the stern and direful god of war
whose sinewy neck in battle ne'er did bow
who conquers where he comes in every jar
yet hath he been my captive and my slave
and begg'd for that which thou unask'd shalt have
'over my altars hath he hung his lance
his batter'd shield his uncontrolled crest
and for my sake hath learn'd to sport and dance
to toy to wanton dally smile and jest
scorning his churlish drum and ensign red
making my arms his field his tent my bed
'thus he that overruled i oversway'd
leading him prisoner in a redrose chain
strongtempered steel his stronger strength obey'd
yet was he servile to my coy disdain
o be not proud nor brag not of thy might
for mastering her that foil'd the god of fight
'touch but my lips with those fair lips of thine
though mine be not so fair yet are they red
the kiss shall be thine own as well as mine
what seest thou in the ground hold up thy head
look in mine eyeballs there thy beauty lies
then why not lips on lips since eyes in eyes
'art thou ashamed to kiss then wink again
and i will wink so shall the day seem night
love keeps his revels where they are but twain
be bold to play our sport is not in sight
these bluevein'd violets whereon we lean
never can blab nor know not what we mean
'the tender spring upon thy tempting lip
shows thee unripe yet mayst thou well be tasted
make use of time let not advantage slip
beauty within itself should not be wasted
fair flowers that are not gather'd in their prime
rot and consume themselves in little time
'were i hardfavour'd foul or wrinkledold
illnurtured crooked churlish harsh in voice
o'erworn despised rheumatic and cold
thicksighted barren lean and lacking juice
then mightst thou pause for then i were not for thee
but having no defects why dost abhor me
'thou canst not see one wrinkle in my brow
mine eyes are gray and bright and quick in turning
my beauty as the spring doth yearly grow
my flesh is soft and plump my marrow burning
my smooth moist hand were it with thy hand felt
would in thy palm dissolve or seem to melt
'bid me discourse i will enchant thine ear
or like a fairy trip upon the green
or like a nymph with long dishevell'd hair
dance on the sands and yet no footing seen
love is a spirit all compact of fire
not gross to sink but light and will aspire
'witness this primrose bank whereon i lie
these forceless flowers like sturdy trees support me
two strengthless doves will draw me through the sky
from morn till night even where i list to sport me
is love so light sweet boy and may it be
that thou shouldst think it heavy unto thee
'is thine own heart to thine own face affected
can thy right hand seize love upon thy left
then woo thyself be of thyself rejected
steal thine own freedom and complain on theft
narcissus so himself himself forsook
and died to kiss his shadow in the brook
'torches are made to light jewels to wear
dainties to taste fresh beauty for the use
herbs for their smell and sappy plants to bear
things growing to themselves are growth's abuse
seeds spring from seeds and beauty breedeth beauty
thou wast begot to get it is thy duty
'upon the earth's increase why shouldst thou feed
unless the earth with thy increase be fed
by law of nature thou art bound to breed
that thine may live when thou thyself art dead
and so in spite of death thou dost survive
in that thy likeness still is left alive'
by this the lovesick queen began to sweat
for where they lay the shadow had forsook them
and titan tired in the midday heat
with burning eye did hotly overlook them
wishing adonis had his team to guide
so he were like him and by venus side
and now adonis with a lazy spright
and with a heavy dark disliking eye
his louring brows o'erwhelming his fair sight
like misty vapours when they blot the sky
souring his cheeks cries fie no more of love
the sun doth burn my face i must remove'
'ay me quoth venus young and so unkind
what bare excuses makest thou to be gone
i'll sigh celestial breath whose gentle wind
shall cool the heat of this descending sun
i'll make a shadow for thee of my hairs
if they burn too i'll quench them with my tears
'the sun that shines from heaven shines but warm
and lo i lie between that sun and thee
the heat i have from thence doth little harm
thine eye darts forth the fire that burneth me
and were i not immortal life were done
between this heavenly and earthly sun
'art thou obdurate flinty hard as steel
nay more than flint for stone at rain relenteth
art thou a woman's son and canst not feel
what tis to love how want of love tormenteth
o had thy mother borne so hard a mind
she had not brought forth thee but died unkind
'what am i that thou shouldst contemn me this
or what great danger dwells upon my suit
what were thy lips the worse for one poor kiss
speak fair but speak fair words or else be mute
give me one kiss i'll give it thee again
and one for interest if thou wilt have twain
'fie lifeless picture cold and senseless stone
wellpainted idol image dun and dead
statue contenting but the eye alone
thing like a man but of no woman bred
thou art no man though of a man's complexion
for men will kiss even by their own direction'
this said impatience chokes her pleading tongue
and swelling passion doth provoke a pause
red cheeks and fiery eyes blaze forth he wrong
being judge in love she cannot right her cause
and now she weeps and now she fain would speak
and now her sobs do her intendments break
sometimes she shakes her head and then his hand
now gazeth she on him now on the ground
sometimes her arms infold him like a band
she would he will not in her arms be bound
and when from thence he struggles to be gone
she locks her lily fingers one in one
'fondling she saith since i have hemm'd thee here
within the circuit of this ivory pale
i'll be a park and thou shalt be my deer
feed where thou wilt on mountain or in dale
graze on my lips and if those hills be dry
stray lower where the pleasant fountains lie
within this limit is relief enough
sweet bottomgrass and high delightful plain
round rising hillocks brakes obscure and rough
to shelter thee from tempest and from rain
then be my deer since i am such a park
no dog shall rouse thee though a thousand bark'
at this adonis smiles as in disdain
that in each cheek appears a pretty dimple
love made those hollows if himself were slain
he might be buried in a tomb so simple
foreknowing well if there he came to lie
why there love lived and there he could not die
these lovely caves these round enchanting pits
open'd their mouths to swallow venus liking
being mad before how doth she now for wits
struck dead at first what needs a second striking
poor queen of love in thine own law forlorn
to love a cheek that smiles at thee in scorn
