 hath not yet dived into the world's deceit
 nor more can you distinguish of a man
 than of his outward show which god he knows
 seldom or never jumpeth with the heart
 those uncles which you want were dangerous
 your grace attended to their sugar'd words
 but look'd not on the poison of their hearts 
 god keep you from them and from such false friends
prince edward god keep me from false friends but they were none
gloucester my lord the mayor of london comes to greet you
 enter the lord mayor and his train
lord mayor god bless your grace with health and happy days
prince edward i thank you good my lord and thank you all
 i thought my mother and my brother york
 would long ere this have met us on the way
 fie what a slug is hastings that he comes not
 to tell us whether they will come or no
 enter hastings
buckingham and in good time here comes the sweating lord
prince edward welcome my lord what will our mother come
hastings on what occasion god he knows not i
 the queen your mother and your brother york
 have taken sanctuary the tender prince
 would fain have come with me to meet your grace
 but by his mother was perforce withheld
buckingham fie what an indirect and peevish course
 is this of hers lord cardinal will your grace
 persuade the queen to send the duke of york
 unto his princely brother presently
 if she deny lord hastings go with him
 and from her jealous arms pluck him perforce
cardinal my lord of buckingham if my weak oratory
 can from his mother win the duke of york
 anon expect him here but if she be obdurate
 to mild entreaties god in heaven forbid
 we should infringe the holy privilege
 of blessed sanctuary not for all this land
 would i be guilty of so deep a sin
buckingham you are too senselessobstinate my lord
 too ceremonious and traditional
 weigh it but with the grossness of this age
 you break not sanctuary in seizing him
 the benefit thereof is always granted
 to those whose dealings have deserved the place
 and those who have the wit to claim the place
 this prince hath neither claim'd it nor deserved it
 and therefore in mine opinion cannot have it
 then taking him from thence that is not there
 you break no privilege nor charter there
 oft have i heard of sanctuary men
 but sanctuary children ne'er till now
cardinal my lord you shall o'errule my mind for once
 come on lord hastings will you go with me
hastings i go my lord
prince edward good lords make all the speedy haste you may
 exeunt cardinal and hastings
 say uncle gloucester if our brother come
 where shall we sojourn till our coronation
gloucester where it seems best unto your royal self
 if i may counsel you some day or two
 your highness shall repose you at the tower
 then where you please and shall be thought most fit
 for your best health and recreation
prince edward i do not like the tower of any place
 did julius caesar build that place my lord
buckingham he did my gracious lord begin that place
 which since succeeding ages have reedified
prince edward is it upon record or else reported
 successively from age to age he built it
buckingham upon record my gracious lord
prince edward but say my lord it were not register'd
 methinks the truth should live from age to age
 as twere retail'd to all posterity
 even to the general allending day
gloucester aside so wise so young they say do never
 live long
prince edward what say you uncle
gloucester i say without characters fame lives long
 aside
 thus like the formal vice iniquity
 i moralize two meanings in one word
prince edward that julius caesar was a famous man
 with what his valour did enrich his wit
 his wit set down to make his valour live
 death makes no conquest of this conqueror
 for now he lives in fame though not in life
 i'll tell you what my cousin buckingham
buckingham what my gracious lord
prince edward an if i live until i be a man
 i'll win our ancient right in france again
 or die a soldier as i lived a king
gloucester aside short summers lightly have a forward spring
 enter young york hastings and the cardinal
buckingham now in good time here comes the duke of york
prince edward richard of york how fares our loving brother
york well my dread lord so must i call you now
prince edward ay brother to our grief as it is yours
 too late he died that might have kept that title
 which by his death hath lost much majesty
gloucester how fares our cousin noble lord of york
york i thank you gentle uncle o my lord
 you said that idle weeds are fast in growth
 the prince my brother hath outgrown me far
gloucester he hath my lord
york and therefore is he idle
gloucester o my fair cousin i must not say so
york then is he more beholding to you than i
gloucester he may command me as my sovereign
 but you have power in me as in a kinsman
york i pray you uncle give me this dagger
gloucester my dagger little cousin with all my heart
prince edward a beggar brother
york of my kind uncle that i know will give
 and being but a toy which is no grief to give
gloucester a greater gift than that i'll give my cousin
york a greater gift o that's the sword to it
gloucester a gentle cousin were it light enough
york o then i see you will part but with light gifts
 in weightier things you'll say a beggar nay
gloucester it is too heavy for your grace to wear
york i weigh it lightly were it heavier
gloucester what would you have my weapon little lord
york i would that i might thank you as you call me
gloucester how
york little
prince edward my lord of york will still be cross in talk
 uncle your grace knows how to bear with him
york you mean to bear me not to bear with me
 uncle my brother mocks both you and me
 because that i am little like an ape
 he thinks that you should bear me on your shoulders
buckingham with what a sharpprovided wit he reasons
 to mitigate the scorn he gives his uncle
 he prettily and aptly taunts himself
 so cunning and so young is wonderful
gloucester my lord will't please you pass along
 myself and my good cousin buckingham
 will to your mother to entreat of her
 to meet you at the tower and welcome you
york what will you go unto the tower my lord
prince edward my lord protector needs will have it so
york i shall not sleep in quiet at the tower
gloucester why what should you fear
york marry my uncle clarence angry ghost
 my grandam told me he was murdered there
prince edward i fear no uncles dead
gloucester nor none that live i hope
prince edward an if they live i hope i need not fear
 but come my lord and with a heavy heart
 thinking on them go i unto the tower
 a sennet exeunt all but gloucester buckingham
 and catesby
buckingham think you my lord this little prating york
 was not incensed by his subtle mother
 to taunt and scorn you thus opprobriously
gloucester no doubt no doubt o tis a parlous boy
 bold quick ingenious forward capable
 he is all the mother's from the top to toe
buckingham well let them rest come hither catesby
 thou art sworn as deeply to effect what we intend
 as closely to conceal what we impart
 thou know'st our reasons urged upon the way
 what think'st thou is it not an easy matter
 to make william lord hastings of our mind
 for the instalment of this noble duke
 in the seat royal of this famous isle
catesby he for his father's sake so loves the prince
 that he will not be won to aught against him
buckingham what think'st thou then of stanley what will he
catesby he will do all in all as hastings doth
buckingham well then no more but this go gentle catesby
 and as it were far off sound thou lord hastings
 how doth he stand affected to our purpose
 and summon him tomorrow to the tower
 to sit about the coronation
 if thou dost find him tractable to us
 encourage him and show him all our reasons
 if he be leaden icycold unwilling
 be thou so too and so break off your talk
 and give us notice of his inclination
 for we tomorrow hold divided councils
 wherein thyself shalt highly be employ'd
gloucester commend me to lord william tell him catesby
 his ancient knot of dangerous adversaries
 tomorrow are let blood at pomfretcastle
 and bid my friend for joy of this good news
 give mistress shore one gentle kiss the more
buckingham good catesby go effect this business soundly
catesby my good lords both with all the heed i may
gloucester shall we hear from you catesby ere we sleep
catesby you shall my lord
gloucester at crosby place there shall you find us both
 exit catesby
buckingham now my lord what shall we do if we perceive
 lord hastings will not yield to our complots
gloucester chop off his head man somewhat we will do
 and look when i am king claim thou of me
 the earldom of hereford and the moveables
 whereof the king my brother stood possess'd
buckingham i'll claim that promise at your grace's hands
