 and then i'll speak a little
 he holds her by the hand silent
coriolanus o mother mother
 what have you done behold the heavens do ope
 the gods look down and this unnatural scene
 they laugh at o my mother mother o
 you have won a happy victory to rome
 but for your sonbelieve it o believe it
 most dangerously you have with him prevail'd
 if not most mortal to him but let it come
 aufidius though i cannot make true wars
 i'll frame convenient peace now good aufidius
 were you in my stead would you have heard
 a mother less or granted less aufidius
aufidius i was moved withal
coriolanus i dare be sworn you were
 and sir it is no little thing to make
 mine eyes to sweat compassion but good sir
 what peace you'll make advise me for my part
 i'll not to rome i'll back with you and pray you
 stand to me in this cause o mother wife
aufidius aside i am glad thou hast set thy mercy and
 thy honour
 at difference in thee out of that i'll work
 myself a former fortune
 the ladies make signs to coriolanus
coriolanus ay by and by
 to volumnia virgilia &c
 but we will drink together and you shall bear
 a better witness back than words which we
 on like conditions will have counterseal'd
 come enter with us ladies you deserve
 to have a temple built you all the swords
 in italy and her confederate arms
 could not have made this peace

act v
scene iv rome a public place
 enter menenius and sicinius
menenius see you yond coign o the capitol yond
 cornerstone
sicinius why what of that
menenius if it be possible for you to displace it with your
 little finger there is some hope the ladies of
 rome especially his mother may prevail with him
 but i say there is no hope in't our throats are
 sentenced and stay upon execution
sicinius is't possible that so short a time can alter the
 condition of a man
menenius there is differency between a grub and a butterfly
 yet your butterfly was a grub this marcius is grown
 from man to dragon he has wings he's more than a
 creeping thing
sicinius he loved his mother dearly
menenius so did he me and he no more remembers his mother
 now than an eightyearold horse the tartness
 of his face sours ripe grapes when he walks he
 moves like an engine and the ground shrinks before
 his treading he is able to pierce a corslet with
 his eye talks like a knell and his hum is a
 battery he sits in his state as a thing made for
 alexander what he bids be done is finished with
 his bidding he wants nothing of a god but eternity
 and a heaven to throne in
sicinius yes mercy if you report him truly
menenius i paint him in the character mark what mercy his
 mother shall bring from him there is no more mercy
 in him than there is milk in a male tiger that
 shall our poor city find and all this is long of
 you
sicinius the gods be good unto us
menenius no in such a case the gods will not be good unto
 us when we banished him we respected not them
 and he returning to break our necks they respect not us
 enter a messenger
messenger sir if you'ld save your life fly to your house
 the plebeians have got your fellowtribune
 and hale him up and down all swearing if
 the roman ladies bring not comfort home
 they'll give him death by inches
 enter a second messenger
sicinius what's the news
second messenger good news good news the ladies have prevail'd
 the volscians are dislodged and marcius gone
 a merrier day did never yet greet rome
 no not the expulsion of the tarquins
sicinius friend
 art thou certain this is true is it most certain
second messenger as certain as i know the sun is fire
 where have you lurk'd that you make doubt of it
 ne'er through an arch so hurried the blown tide
 as the recomforted through the gates why hark you
 trumpets hautboys drums beat all together
 the trumpets sackbuts psalteries and fifes
 tabours and cymbals and the shouting romans
 make the sun dance hark you
 a shout within
menenius this is good news
 i will go meet the ladies this volumnia
 is worth of consuls senators patricians
 a city full of tribunes such as you
 a sea and land full you have pray'd well today
 this morning for ten thousand of your throats
 i'd not have given a doit hark how they joy
 music still with shouts
sicinius first the gods bless you for your tidings next
 accept my thankfulness
second messenger sir we have all
 great cause to give great thanks
sicinius they are near the city
second messenger almost at point to enter
sicinius we will meet them
 and help the joy

 enter two senators with volumnia virgilia
 valeria &c passing over the stage
 followed by patricians and others
first senator behold our patroness the life of rome
 call all your tribes together praise the gods
 and make triumphant fires strew flowers before them
 unshout the noise that banish'd marcius
 repeal him with the welcome of his mother
 cry welcome ladies welcome'
all welcome ladies welcome

 enter tullus aufidius with attendants
aufidius go tell the lords o the city i am here
 deliver them this paper having read it
 bid them repair to the market place where i
 even in theirs and in the commons ears
 will vouch the truth of it him i accuse
 the city ports by this hath enter'd and
 intends to appear before the people hoping
 to purge herself with words dispatch
 exeunt attendants
 enter three or four conspirators of aufidius faction
 most welcome
first conspirator how is it with our general
aufidius even so
 as with a man by his own alms empoison'd
 and with his charity slain
second conspirator most noble sir
 if you do hold the same intent wherein
 you wish'd us parties we'll deliver you
 of your great danger
aufidius sir i cannot tell
 we must proceed as we do find the people
third conspirator the people will remain uncertain whilst
 twixt you there's difference but the fall of either
 makes the survivor heir of all
aufidius i know it
 and my pretext to strike at him admits
 a good construction i raised him and i pawn'd
 mine honour for his truth who being so heighten'd
 he water'd his new plants with dews of flattery
 seducing so my friends and to this end
 he bow'd his nature never known before
 but to be rough unswayable and free
third conspirator sir his stoutness
 when he did stand for consul which he lost
 by lack of stooping
aufidius that i would have spoke of
 being banish'd for't he came unto my hearth
 presented to my knife his throat i took him
 made him jointservant with me gave him way
 in all his own desires nay let him choose
 out of my files his projects to accomplish
 my best and freshest men served his designments
 in mine own person holp to reap the fame
 which he did end all his and took some pride
 to do myself this wrong till at the last
 i seem'd his follower not partner and
 he waged me with his countenance as if
 i had been mercenary
first conspirator so he did my lord
 the army marvell'd at it and in the last
 when he had carried rome and that we look'd
 for no less spoil than glory
aufidius there was it
 for which my sinews shall be stretch'd upon him
 at a few drops of women's rheum which are
 as cheap as lies he sold the blood and labour
 of our great action therefore shall he die
 and i'll renew me in his fall but hark
 drums and trumpets sound with great shouts of
 the people
first conspirator your native town you enter'd like a post
 and had no welcomes home but he returns
 splitting the air with noise
second conspirator and patient fools
 whose children he hath slain their base throats tear
 with giving him glory
third conspirator therefore at your vantage
