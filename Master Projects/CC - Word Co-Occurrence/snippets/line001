and god spake unto noah saying
go forth of the ark thou and thy wife and thy sons and thy sons wives with thee
bring forth with thee every living thing that is with thee of all flesh both of fowl and of cattle and of every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth that they may breed abundantly in the earth and be fruitful and multiply upon the earth
and noah went forth and his sons and his wife and his sons wives with him
every beast every creeping thing and every fowl and whatsoever creepeth upon the earth after their kinds went forth out of the ark
and noah builded an altar unto the lord and took of every clean beast and of every clean fowl and offered burnt offerings on the altar
and the lord smelled a sweet savour and the lord said in his heart i will not again curse the ground any more for man's sake for the imagination of man's heart is evil from his youth neither will i again smite any more every thing living as i have done
while the earth remaineth seedtime and harvest and cold and heat and summer and winter and day and night shall not cease
and god blessed noah and his sons and said unto them be fruitful and multiply and replenish the earth
and the fear of you and the dread of you shall be upon every beast of the earth and upon every fowl of the air upon all that moveth upon the earth and upon all the fishes of the sea into your hand are they delivered
every moving thing that liveth shall be meat for you even as the green herb have i given you all things
but flesh with the life thereof which is the blood thereof shall ye not eat
and surely your blood of your lives will i require at the hand of every beast will i require it and at the hand of man at the hand of every man's brother will i require the life of man
whoso sheddeth man's blood by man shall his blood be shed for in the image of god made he man
and you be ye fruitful and multiply bring forth abundantly in the earth and multiply therein
and god spake unto noah and to his sons with him saying
and i behold i establish my covenant with you and with your seed after you
and with every living creature that is with you of the fowl of the cattle and of every beast of the earth with you from all that go out of the ark to every beast of the earth
and i will establish my covenant with you neither shall all flesh be cut off any more by the waters of a flood neither shall there any more be a flood to destroy the earth
and god said this is the token of the covenant which i make between me and you and every living creature that is with you for perpetual generations
i do set my bow in the cloud and it shall be for a token of a covenant between me and the earth
and it shall come to pass when i bring a cloud over the earth that the bow shall be seen in the cloud
and i will remember my covenant which is between me and you and every living creature of all flesh and the waters shall no more become a flood to destroy all flesh
and the bow shall be in the cloud and i will look upon it that i may remember the everlasting covenant between god and every living creature of all flesh that is upon the earth
and god said unto noah this is the token of the covenant which i have established between me and all flesh that is upon the earth
and the sons of noah that went forth of the ark were shem and ham and japheth and ham is the father of canaan
these are the three sons of noah and of them was the whole earth overspread
and noah began to be an husbandman and he planted a vineyard
and he drank of the wine and was drunken and he was uncovered within his tent
and ham the father of canaan saw the nakedness of his father and told his two brethren without
and shem and japheth took a garment and laid it upon both their shoulders and went backward and covered the nakedness of their father and their faces were backward and they saw not their father's nakedness
and noah awoke from his wine and knew what his younger son had done unto him
and he said cursed be canaan a servant of servants shall he be unto his brethren
and he said blessed be the lord god of shem and canaan shall be his servant
god shall enlarge japheth and he shall dwell in the tents of shem and canaan shall be his servant
and noah lived after the flood three hundred and fifty years
and all the days of noah were nine hundred and fifty years and he died
now these are the generations of the sons of noah shem ham and japheth and unto them were sons born after the flood
the sons of japheth gomer and magog and madai and javan and tubal and meshech and tiras
and the sons of gomer ashkenaz and riphath and togarmah
and the sons of javan elishah and tarshish kittim and dodanim
by these were the isles of the gentiles divided in their lands every one after his tongue after their families in their nations
and the sons of ham cush and mizraim and phut and canaan
and the sons of cush seba and havilah and sabtah and raamah and sabtechah and the sons of raamah sheba and dedan
and cush begat nimrod he began to be a mighty one in the earth
he was a mighty hunter before the lord wherefore it is said even as nimrod the mighty hunter before the lord
and the beginning of his kingdom was babel and erech and accad and calneh in the land of shinar
out of that land went forth asshur and builded nineveh and the city rehoboth and calah
and resen between nineveh and calah the same is a great city
and mizraim begat ludim and anamim and lehabim and naphtuhim
and pathrusim and casluhim out of whom came philistim and caphtorim
and canaan begat sidon his first born and heth
and the jebusite and the amorite and the girgasite
and the hivite and the arkite and the sinite
and the arvadite and the zemarite and the hamathite and afterward were the families of the canaanites spread abroad
and the border of the canaanites was from sidon as thou comest to gerar unto gaza as thou goest unto sodom and gomorrah and admah and zeboim even unto lasha
these are the sons of ham after their families after their tongues in their countries and in their nations
unto shem also the father of all the children of eber the brother of japheth the elder even to him were children born
the children of shem elam and asshur and arphaxad and lud and aram
and the children of aram uz and hul and gether and mash
and arphaxad begat salah and salah begat eber
and unto eber were born two sons the name of one was peleg for in his days was the earth divided and his brother's name was joktan
and joktan begat almodad and sheleph and hazarmaveth and jerah
and hadoram and uzal and diklah
and obal and abimael and sheba
and ophir and havilah and jobab all these were the sons of joktan
and their dwelling was from mesha as thou goest unto sephar a mount of the east
these are the sons of shem after their families after their tongues in their lands after their nations
these are the families of the sons of noah after their generations in their nations and by these were the nations divided in the earth after the flood
and the whole earth was of one language and of one speech
and it came to pass as they journeyed from the east that they found a plain in the land of shinar and they dwelt there
and they said one to another go to let us make brick and burn them thoroughly and they had brick for stone and slime had they for morter
and they said go to let us build us a city and a tower whose top may reach unto heaven and let us make us a name lest we be scattered abroad upon the face of the whole earth
and the lord came down to see the city and the tower which the children of men builded
and the lord said behold the people is one and they have all one language and this they begin to do and now nothing will be restrained from them which they have imagined to do
go to let us go down and there confound their language that they may not understand one another's speech
so the lord scattered them abroad from thence upon the face of all the earth and they left off to build the city
therefore is the name of it called babel because the lord did there confound the language of all the earth and from thence did the lord scatter them abroad upon the face of all the earth
these are the generations of shem shem was an hundred years old and begat arphaxad two years after the flood
and shem lived after he begat arphaxad five hundred years and begat sons and daughters
and arphaxad lived five and thirty years and begat salah
and arphaxad lived after he begat salah four hundred and three years and begat sons and daughters
and salah lived thirty years and begat eber
and salah lived after he begat eber four hundred and three years and begat sons and daughters
and eber lived four and thirty years and begat peleg
and eber lived after he begat peleg four hundred and thirty years and begat sons and daughters
and peleg lived thirty years and begat reu
and peleg lived after he begat reu two hundred and nine years and begat sons and daughters
and reu lived two and thirty years and begat serug
and reu lived after he begat serug two hundred and seven years and begat sons and daughters
and serug lived thirty years and begat nahor
and serug lived after he begat nahor two hundred years and begat sons and daughters
and nahor lived nine and twenty years and begat terah
and nahor lived after he begat terah an hundred and nineteen years and begat sons and daughters
and terah lived seventy years and begat abram nahor and haran
now these are the generations of terah terah begat abram nahor and haran and haran begat lot
and haran died before his father terah in the land of his nativity in ur of the chaldees
and abram and nahor took them wives the name of abram's wife was sarai and the name of nahor's wife milcah the daughter of haran the father of milcah and the father of iscah
but sarai was barren she had no child
and terah took abram his son and lot the son of haran his son's son and sarai his daughter in law his son abram's wife and they went forth with them from ur of the chaldees to go into the land of canaan and they came unto haran and dwelt there
and the days of terah were two hundred and five years and terah died in haran
now the lord had said unto abram get thee out of thy country and from thy kindred and from thy father's house unto a land that i will shew thee
and i will make of thee a great nation and i will bless thee and make thy name great and thou shalt be a blessing
and i will bless them that bless thee and curse him that curseth thee and in thee shall all families of the earth be blessed
so abram departed as the lord had spoken unto him and lot went with him and abram was seventy and five years old when he departed out of haran
and abram took sarai his wife and lot his brother's son and all their substance that they had gathered and the souls that they had gotten in haran and they went forth to go into the land of canaan and into the land of canaan they came
and abram passed through the land unto the place of sichem unto the plain of moreh and the canaanite was then in the land
and the lord appeared unto abram and said unto thy seed will i give this land and there builded he an altar unto the lord who appeared unto him
and he removed from thence unto a mountain on the east of bethel and pitched his tent having bethel on the west and hai on the east and there he builded an altar unto the lord and called upon the name of the lord
and abram journeyed going on still toward the south
and there was a famine in the land and abram went down into egypt to sojourn there for the famine was grievous in the land
and it came to pass when he was come near to enter into egypt that he said unto sarai his wife behold now i know that thou art a fair woman to look upon
therefore it shall come to pass when the egyptians shall see thee that they shall say this is his wife and they will kill me but they will save thee alive
say i pray thee thou art my sister that it may be well with me for thy sake and my soul shall live because of thee
and it came to pass that when abram was come into egypt the egyptians beheld the woman that she was very fair
the princes also of pharaoh saw her and commended her before pharaoh and the woman was taken into pharaoh's house
and he entreated abram well for her sake and he had sheep and oxen and he asses and menservants and maidservants and she asses and camels
and the lord plagued pharaoh and his house with great plagues because of sarai abram's wife
and pharaoh called abram and said what is this that thou hast done unto me why didst thou not tell me that she was thy wife
why saidst thou she is my sister so i might have taken her to me to wife now therefore behold thy wife take her and go thy way
and pharaoh commanded his men concerning him and they sent him away and his wife and all that he had
and abram went up out of egypt he and his wife and all that he had and lot with him into the south
and abram was very rich in cattle in silver and in gold
and he went on his journeys from the south even to bethel unto the place where his tent had been at the beginning between bethel and hai
unto the place of the altar which he had made there at the first and there abram called on the name of the lord
and lot also which went with abram had flocks and herds and tents
and the land was not able to bear them that they might dwell together for their substance was great so that they could not dwell together
and there was a strife between the herdmen of abram's cattle and the herdmen of lot's cattle and the canaanite and the perizzite dwelled then in the land
and abram said unto lot let there be no strife i pray thee between me and thee and between my herdmen and thy herdmen for we be brethren
is not the whole land before thee separate thyself i pray thee from me if thou wilt take the left hand then i will go to the right or if thou depart to the right hand then i will go to the left
and lot lifted up his eyes and beheld all the plain of jordan that it was well watered every where before the lord destroyed sodom and gomorrah even as the garden of the lord like the land of egypt as thou comest unto zoar
then lot chose him all the plain of jordan and lot journeyed east and they separated themselves the one from the other
abram dwelled in the land of canaan and lot dwelled in the cities of the plain and pitched his tent toward sodom
but the men of sodom were wicked and sinners before the lord exceedingly
and the lord said unto abram after that lot was separated from him lift up now thine eyes and look from the place where thou art northward and southward and eastward and westward
for all the land which thou seest to thee will i give it and to thy seed for ever
and i will make thy seed as the dust of the earth so that if a man can number the dust of the earth then shall thy seed also be numbered
arise walk through the land in the length of it and in the breadth of it for i will give it unto thee
then abram removed his tent and came and dwelt in the plain of mamre which is in hebron and built there an altar unto the lord
and it came to pass in the days of amraphel king of shinar arioch king of ellasar chedorlaomer king of elam and tidal king of nations
that these made war with bera king of sodom and with birsha king of gomorrah shinab king of admah and shemeber king of zeboiim and the king of bela which is zoar
all these were joined together in the vale of siddim which is the salt sea
twelve years they served chedorlaomer and in the thirteenth year they rebelled
and in the fourteenth year came chedorlaomer and the kings that were with him and smote the rephaims in ashteroth karnaim and the zuzims in ham and the emims in shaveh kiriathaim
and the horites in their mount seir unto elparan which is by the wilderness
and they returned and came to enmishpat which is kadesh and smote all the country of the amalekites and also the amorites that dwelt in hazezontamar
and there went out the king of sodom and the king of gomorrah and the king of admah and the king of zeboiim and the king of bela the same is zoar and they joined battle with them in the vale of siddim
with chedorlaomer the king of elam and with tidal king of nations and amraphel king of shinar and arioch king of ellasar four kings with five
and the vale of siddim was full of slimepits and the kings of sodom and gomorrah fled and fell there and they that remained fled to the mountain
and they took all the goods of sodom and gomorrah and all their victuals and went their way
and they took lot abram's brother's son who dwelt in sodom and his goods and departed
and there came one that had escaped and told abram the hebrew for he dwelt in the plain of mamre the amorite brother of eshcol and brother of aner and these were confederate with abram
and when abram heard that his brother was taken captive he armed his trained servants born in his own house three hundred and eighteen and pursued them unto dan
and he divided himself against them he and his servants by night and smote them and pursued them unto hobah which is on the left hand of damascus
and he brought back all the goods and also brought again his brother lot and his goods and the women also and the people
and the king of sodom went out to meet him after his return from the slaughter of chedorlaomer and of the kings that were with him at the valley of shaveh which is the king's dale
and melchizedek king of salem brought forth bread and wine and he was the priest of the most high god
and he blessed him and said blessed be abram of the most high god possessor of heaven and earth
and blessed be the most high god which hath delivered thine enemies into thy hand and he gave him tithes of all
and the king of sodom said unto abram give me the persons and take the goods to thyself
and abram said to the king of sodom i have lift up mine hand unto the lord the most high god the possessor of heaven and earth
that i will not take from a thread even to a shoelatchet and that i will not take any thing that is thine lest thou shouldest say i have made abram rich
save only that which the young men have eaten and the portion of the men which went with me aner eshcol and mamre let them take their portion
after these things the word of the lord came unto abram in a vision saying fear not abram i am thy shield and thy exceeding great reward
and abram said lord god what wilt thou give me seeing i go childless and the steward of my house is this eliezer of damascus
and abram said behold to me thou hast given no seed and lo one born in my house is mine heir
and behold the word of the lord came unto him saying this shall not be thine heir but he that shall come forth out of thine own bowels shall be thine heir
and he brought him forth abroad and said look now toward heaven and tell the stars if thou be able to number them and he said unto him so shall thy seed be
and he believed in the lord and he counted it to him for righteousness
and he said unto him i am the lord that brought thee out of ur of the chaldees to give thee this land to inherit it
and he said lord god whereby shall i know that i shall inherit it
and he said unto him take me an heifer of three years old and a she goat of three years old and a ram of three years old and a turtledove and a young pigeon
and he took unto him all these and divided them in the midst and laid each piece one against another but the birds divided he not
and when the fowls came down upon the carcases abram drove them away
and when the sun was going down a deep sleep fell upon abram and lo an horror of great darkness fell upon him
and he said unto abram know of a surety that thy seed shall be a stranger in a land that is not theirs and shall serve them and they shall afflict them four hundred years
and also that nation whom they shall serve will i judge and afterward shall they come out with great substance
and thou shalt go to thy fathers in peace thou shalt be buried in a good old age
but in the fourth generation they shall come hither again for the iniquity of the amorites is not yet full
and it came to pass that when the sun went down and it was dark behold a smoking furnace and a burning lamp that passed between those pieces
in the same day the lord made a covenant with abram saying unto thy seed have i given this land from the river of egypt unto the great river the river euphrates
the kenites and the kenizzites and the kadmonites
and the hittites and the perizzites and the rephaims
and the amorites and the canaanites and the girgashites and the jebusites
now sarai abram's wife bare him no children and she had an handmaid an egyptian whose name was hagar
and sarai said unto abram behold now the lord hath restrained me from bearing i pray thee go in unto my maid it may be that i may obtain children by her and abram hearkened to the voice of sarai
and sarai abram's wife took hagar her maid the egyptian after abram had dwelt ten years in the land of canaan and gave her to her husband abram to be his wife
and he went in unto hagar and she conceived and when she saw that she had conceived her mistress was despised in her eyes
and sarai said unto abram my wrong be upon thee i have given my maid into thy bosom and when she saw that she had conceived i was despised in her eyes the lord judge between me and thee
but abram said unto sarai behold thy maid is in thy hand do to her as it pleaseth thee and when sarai dealt hardly with her she fled from her face
and the angel of the lord found her by a fountain of water in the wilderness by the fountain in the way to shur
and he said hagar sarai's maid whence camest thou and whither wilt thou go and she said i flee from the face of my mistress sarai
and the angel of the lord said unto her return to thy mistress and submit thyself under her hands
and the angel of the lord said unto her i will multiply thy seed exceedingly that it shall not be numbered for multitude
and the angel of the lord said unto her behold thou art with child and shalt bear a son and shalt call his name ishmael because the lord hath heard thy affliction
and he will be a wild man his hand will be against every man and every man's hand against him and he shall dwell in the presence of all his brethren
and she called the name of the lord that spake unto her thou god seest me for she said have i also here looked after him that seeth me
wherefore the well was called beerlahairoi behold it is between kadesh and bered
and hagar bare abram a son and abram called his son's name which hagar bare ishmael
and abram was fourscore and six years old when hagar bare ishmael to abram
