duke orsino here comes the countess now heaven walks on earth
 but for thee fellow fellow thy words are madness
 three months this youth hath tended upon me
 but more of that anon take him aside
olivia what would my lord but that he may not have
 wherein olivia may seem serviceable
 cesario you do not keep promise with me
viola madam
duke orsino gracious olivia
olivia what do you say cesario good my lord
viola my lord would speak my duty hushes me
olivia if it be aught to the old tune my lord
 it is as fat and fulsome to mine ear
 as howling after music
duke orsino still so cruel
olivia still so constant lord
duke orsino what to perverseness you uncivil lady
 to whose ingrate and unauspicious altars
 my soul the faithfull'st offerings hath breathed out
 that e'er devotion tender'd what shall i do
olivia even what it please my lord that shall become him
duke orsino why should i not had i the heart to do it
 like to the egyptian thief at point of death
 kill what i lovea savage jealousy
 that sometimes savours nobly but hear me this
 since you to nonregardance cast my faith
 and that i partly know the instrument
 that screws me from my true place in your favour
 live you the marblebreasted tyrant still
 but this your minion whom i know you love
 and whom by heaven i swear i tender dearly
 him will i tear out of that cruel eye
 where he sits crowned in his master's spite
 come boy with me my thoughts are ripe in mischief
 i'll sacrifice the lamb that i do love
 to spite a raven's heart within a dove
viola and i most jocund apt and willingly
 to do you rest a thousand deaths would die
olivia where goes cesario
viola after him i love
 more than i love these eyes more than my life
 more by all mores than e'er i shall love wife
 if i do feign you witnesses above
 punish my life for tainting of my love
olivia ay me detested how am i beguiled
viola who does beguile you who does do you wrong
olivia hast thou forgot thyself is it so long
 call forth the holy father
duke orsino come away

 that makes thee strangle thy propriety

 as great as that thou fear'st

 o welcome father
 father i charge thee by thy reverence
 here to unfold though lately we intended
 to keep in darkness what occasion now
 reveals before tis ripe what thou dost know
 hath newly pass'd between this youth and me
priest a contract of eternal bond of love
 confirm'd by mutual joinder of your hands
 attested by the holy close of lips
 strengthen'd by interchangement of your rings
 and all the ceremony of this compact
 seal'd in my function by my testimony
 since when my watch hath told me toward my grave
 i have travell'd but two hours
duke orsino o thou dissembling cub what wilt thou be
 when time hath sow'd a grizzle on thy case
 or will not else thy craft so quickly grow
 that thine own trip shall be thine overthrow
 farewell and take her but direct thy feet
 where thou and i henceforth may never meet
viola my lord i do protest
olivia o do not swear
 hold little faith though thou hast too much fear

 enter sebastian
sebastian i am sorry madam i have hurt your kinsman
 but had it been the brother of my blood
 i must have done no less with wit and safety
 you throw a strange regard upon me and by that
 i do perceive it hath offended you
 pardon me sweet one even for the vows
 we made each other but so late ago
duke orsino one face one voice one habit and two persons
 a natural perspective that is and is not
sebastian antonio o my dear antonio
 how have the hours rack'd and tortured me
 since i have lost thee
antonio sebastian are you
sebastian fear'st thou that antonio
antonio how have you made division of yourself
 an apple cleft in two is not more twin
 than these two creatures which is sebastian
olivia most wonderful
sebastian do i stand there i never had a brother
 nor can there be that deity in my nature
 of here and every where i had a sister
 whom the blind waves and surges have devour'd
 of charity what kin are you to me
 what countryman what name what parentage
viola of messaline sebastian was my father
 such a sebastian was my brother too
 so went he suited to his watery tomb
 if spirits can assume both form and suit
 you come to fright us
sebastian a spirit i am indeed
 but am in that dimension grossly clad
 which from the womb i did participate
 were you a woman as the rest goes even
 i should my tears let fall upon your cheek
 and say thricewelcome drowned viola'
viola my father had a mole upon his brow
sebastian and so had mine
viola and died that day when viola from her birth
 had number'd thirteen years
sebastian o that record is lively in my soul
 he finished indeed his mortal act
 that day that made my sister thirteen years
viola if nothing lets to make us happy both
 but this my masculine usurp'd attire
 do not embrace me till each circumstance
 of place time fortune do cohere and jump
 that i am viola which to confirm
 i'll bring you to a captain in this town
 where lie my maiden weeds by whose gentle help
 i was preserved to serve this noble count
 all the occurrence of my fortune since
 hath been between this lady and this lord
sebastian to olivia so comes it lady you have been mistook
 but nature to her bias drew in that
 you would have been contracted to a maid
 nor are you therein by my life deceived
 you are betroth'd both to a maid and man
duke orsino be not amazed right noble is his blood
 if this be so as yet the glass seems true
 i shall have share in this most happy wreck
 to viola
 boy thou hast said to me a thousand times
 thou never shouldst love woman like to me
viola and all those sayings will i overswear
 and those swearings keep as true in soul
 as doth that orbed continent the fire
 that severs day from night
duke orsino give me thy hand
 and let me see thee in thy woman's weeds
viola the captain that did bring me first on shore
 hath my maid's garments he upon some action
 is now in durance at malvolio's suit
 a gentleman and follower of my lady's
olivia he shall enlarge him fetch malvolio hither
 and yet alas now i remember me
 they say poor gentleman he's much distract
 reenter clown with a letter and fabian
 a most extracting frenzy of mine own
 from my remembrance clearly banish'd his
 how does he sirrah
