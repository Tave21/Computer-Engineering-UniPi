1sm2211 then the king sent to call ahimelech the priest the son of ahitub and all his father's house the priests that were in nob and they came all of them to the king
1sm2212 and saul said hear now thou son of ahitub and he answered here i am my lord
1sm2213 and saul said unto him why have ye conspired against me thou and the son of jesse in that thou hast given him bread and a sword and hast enquired of god for him that he should rise against me to lie in wait as at this day
1sm2214 then ahimelech answered the king and said and who is so faithful among all thy servants as david which is the king's son in law and goeth at thy bidding and is honourable in thine house
1sm2215 did i then begin to enquire of god for him be it far from me let not the king impute any thing unto his servant nor to all the house of my father for thy servant knew nothing of all this less or more
1sm2216 and the king said thou shalt surely die ahimelech thou and all thy father's house
1sm2217 and the king said unto the footmen that stood about him turn and slay the priests of the lord because their hand also is with david and because they knew when he fled and did not shew it to me but the servants of the king would not put forth their hand to fall upon the priests of the lord
1sm2218 and the king said to doeg turn thou and fall upon the priests and doeg the edomite turned and he fell upon the priests and slew on that day fourscore and five persons that did wear a linen ephod
1sm2219 and nob the city of the priests smote he with the edge of the sword both men and women children and sucklings and oxen and asses and sheep with the edge of the sword
1sm2220 and one of the sons of ahimelech the son of ahitub named abiathar escaped and fled after david
1sm2221 and abiathar shewed david that saul had slain the lord's priests
1sm2222 and david said unto abiathar i knew it that day when doeg the edomite was there that he would surely tell saul i have occasioned the death of all the persons of thy father's house
1sm2223 abide thou with me fear not for he that seeketh my life seeketh thy life but with me thou shalt be in safeguard
1sm231 then they told david saying behold the philistines fight against keilah and they rob the threshingfloors
1sm232 therefore david enquired of the lord saying shall i go and smite these philistines and the lord said unto david go and smite the philistines and save keilah
1sm233 and david's men said unto him behold we be afraid here in judah how much more then if we come to keilah against the armies of the philistines
1sm234 then david enquired of the lord yet again and the lord answered him and said arise go down to keilah for i will deliver the philistines into thine hand
1sm235 so david and his men went to keilah and fought with the philistines and brought away their cattle and smote them with a great slaughter so david saved the inhabitants of keilah
1sm236 and it came to pass when abiathar the son of ahimelech fled to david to keilah that he came down with an ephod in his hand
1sm237 and it was told saul that david was come to keilah and saul said god hath delivered him into mine hand for he is shut in by entering into a town that hath gates and bars
1sm238 and saul called all the people together to war to go down to keilah to besiege david and his men
1sm239 and david knew that saul secretly practised mischief against him and he said to abiathar the priest bring hither the ephod
1sm2310 then said david o lord god of israel thy servant hath certainly heard that saul seeketh to come to keilah to destroy the city for my sake
1sm2311 will the men of keilah deliver me up into his hand will saul come down as thy servant hath heard o lord god of israel i beseech thee tell thy servant and the lord said he will come down
1sm2312 then said david will the men of keilah deliver me and my men into the hand of saul and the lord said they will deliver thee up
1sm2313 then david and his men which were about six hundred arose and departed out of keilah and went whithersoever they could go and it was told saul that david was escaped from keilah and he forbare to go forth
1sm2314 and david abode in the wilderness in strong holds and remained in a mountain in the wilderness of ziph and saul sought him every day but god delivered him not into his hand
1sm2315 and david saw that saul was come out to seek his life and david was in the wilderness of ziph in a wood
1sm2316 and jonathan saul's son arose and went to david into the wood and strengthened his hand in god
1sm2317 and he said unto him fear not for the hand of saul my father shall not find thee and thou shalt be king over israel and i shall be next unto thee and that also saul my father knoweth
1sm2318 and they two made a covenant before the lord and david abode in the wood and jonathan went to his house
1sm2319 then came up the ziphites to saul to gibeah saying doth not david hide himself with us in strong holds in the wood in the hill of hachilah which is on the south of jeshimon
1sm2320 now therefore o king come down according to all the desire of thy soul to come down and our part shall be to deliver him into the king's hand
1sm2321 and saul said blessed be ye of the lord for ye have compassion on me
1sm2322 go i pray you prepare yet and know and see his place where his haunt is and who hath seen him there for it is told me that he dealeth very subtilly
1sm2323 see therefore and take knowledge of all the lurking places where he hideth himself and come ye again to me with the certainty and i will go with you and it shall come to pass if he be in the land that i will search him out throughout all the thousands of judah
1sm2324 and they arose and went to ziph before saul but david and his men were in the wilderness of maon in the plain on the south of jeshimon
1sm2325 saul also and his men went to seek him and they told david wherefore he came down into a rock and abode in the wilderness of maon and when saul heard that he pursued after david in the wilderness of maon
1sm2326 and saul went on this side of the mountain and david and his men on that side of the mountain and david made haste to get away for fear of saul for saul and his men compassed david and his men round about to take them
1sm2327 but there came a messenger unto saul saying haste thee and come for the philistines have invaded the land
1sm2328 wherefore saul returned from pursuing after david and went against the philistines therefore they called that place selahammahlekoth
1sm2329 and david went up from thence and dwelt in strong holds at engedi
1sm241 and it came to pass when saul was returned from following the philistines that it was told him saying behold david is in the wilderness of engedi
1sm242 then saul took three thousand chosen men out of all israel and went to seek david and his men upon the rocks of the wild goats
1sm243 and he came to the sheepcotes by the way where was a cave and saul went in to cover his feet and david and his men remained in the sides of the cave
1sm244 and the men of david said unto him behold the day of which the lord said unto thee behold i will deliver thine enemy into thine hand that thou mayest do to him as it shall seem good unto thee then david arose and cut off the skirt of saul's robe privily
1sm245 and it came to pass afterward that david's heart smote him because he had cut off saul's skirt
1sm246 and he said unto his men the lord forbid that i should do this thing unto my master the lord's anointed to stretch forth mine hand against him seeing he is the anointed of the lord
1sm247 so david stayed his servants with these words and suffered them not to rise against saul but saul rose up out of the cave and went on his way
1sm248 david also arose afterward and went out of the cave and cried after saul saying my lord the king and when saul looked behind him david stooped with his face to the earth and bowed himself
1sm249 and david said to saul wherefore hearest thou men's words saying behold david seeketh thy hurt
1sm2410 behold this day thine eyes have seen how that the lord had delivered thee to day into mine hand in the cave and some bade me kill thee but mine eye spared thee and i said i will not put forth mine hand against my lord for he is the lord's anointed
1sm2411 moreover my father see yea see the skirt of thy robe in my hand for in that i cut off the skirt of thy robe and killed thee not know thou and see that there is neither evil nor transgression in mine hand and i have not sinned against thee yet thou huntest my soul to take it
1sm2412 the lord judge between me and thee and the lord avenge me of thee but mine hand shall not be upon thee
1sm2413 as saith the proverb of the ancients wickedness proceedeth from the wicked but mine hand shall not be upon thee
1sm2414 after whom is the king of israel come out after whom dost thou pursue after a dead dog after a flea
1sm2415 the lord therefore be judge and judge between me and thee and see and plead my cause and deliver me out of thine hand
1sm2416 and it came to pass when david had made an end of speaking these words unto saul that saul said is this thy voice my son david and saul lifted up his voice and wept
1sm2417 and he said to david thou art more righteous than i for thou hast rewarded me good whereas i have rewarded thee evil
1sm2418 and thou hast shewed this day how that thou hast dealt well with me forasmuch as when the lord had delivered me into thine hand thou killedst me not
1sm2419 for if a man find his enemy will he let him go well away wherefore the lord reward thee good for that thou hast done unto me this day
1sm2420 and now behold i know well that thou shalt surely be king and that the kingdom of israel shall be established in thine hand
1sm2421 swear now therefore unto me by the lord that thou wilt not cut off my seed after me and that thou wilt not destroy my name out of my father's house
1sm2422 and david sware unto saul and saul went home but david and his men gat them up unto the hold
1sm251 and samuel died and all the israelites were gathered together and lamented him and buried him in his house at ramah and david arose and went down to the wilderness of paran
1sm252 and there was a man in maon whose possessions were in carmel and the man was very great and he had three thousand sheep and a thousand goats and he was shearing his sheep in carmel
1sm253 now the name of the man was nabal and the name of his wife abigail and she was a woman of good understanding and of a beautiful countenance but the man was churlish and evil in his doings and he was of the house of caleb
1sm254 and david heard in the wilderness that nabal did shear his sheep
1sm255 and david sent out ten young men and david said unto the young men get you up to carmel and go to nabal and greet him in my name
1sm256 and thus shall ye say to him that liveth in prosperity peace be both to thee and peace be to thine house and peace be unto all that thou hast
1sm257 and now i have heard that thou hast shearers now thy shepherds which were with us we hurt them not neither was there ought missing unto them all the while they were in carmel
1sm258 ask thy young men and they will shew thee wherefore let the young men find favour in thine eyes for we come in a good day give i pray thee whatsoever cometh to thine hand unto thy servants and to thy son david
1sm259 and when david's young men came they spake to nabal according to all those words in the name of david and ceased
1sm2510 and nabal answered david's servants and said who is david and who is the son of jesse there be many servants now a days that break away every man from his master
1sm2511 shall i then take my bread and my water and my flesh that i have killed for my shearers and give it unto men whom i know not whence they be
1sm2512 so david's young men turned their way and went again and came and told him all those sayings
1sm2513 and david said unto his men gird ye on every man his sword and they girded on every man his sword and david also girded on his sword and there went up after david about four hundred men and two hundred abode by the stuff
1sm2514 but one of the young men told abigail nabal's wife saying behold david sent messengers out of the wilderness to salute our master and he railed on them
1sm2515 but the men were very good unto us and we were not hurt neither missed we any thing as long as we were conversant with them when we were in the fields
1sm2516 they were a wall unto us both by night and day all the while we were with them keeping the sheep
1sm2517 now therefore know and consider what thou wilt do for evil is determined against our master and against all his household for he is such a son of belial that a man cannot speak to him
1sm2518 then abigail made haste and took two hundred loaves and two bottles of wine and five sheep ready dressed and five measures of parched corn and an hundred clusters of raisins and two hundred cakes of figs and laid them on asses
1sm2519 and she said unto her servants go on before me behold i come after you but she told not her husband nabal
1sm2520 and it was so as she rode on the ass that she came down by the covert of the hill and behold david and his men came down against her and she met them
1sm2521 now david had said surely in vain have i kept all that this fellow hath in the wilderness so that nothing was missed of all that pertained unto him and he hath requited me evil for good
1sm2522 so and more also do god unto the enemies of david if i leave of all that pertain to him by the morning light any that pisseth against the wall
1sm2523 and when abigail saw david she hasted and lighted off the ass and fell before david on her face and bowed herself to the ground
1sm2524 and fell at his feet and said upon me my lord upon me let this iniquity be and let thine handmaid i pray thee speak in thine audience and hear the words of thine handmaid
1sm2525 let not my lord i pray thee regard this man of belial even nabal for as his name is so is he nabal is his name and folly is with him but i thine handmaid saw not the young men of my lord whom thou didst send
1sm2526 now therefore my lord as the lord liveth and as thy soul liveth seeing the lord hath withholden thee from coming to shed blood and from avenging thyself with thine own hand now let thine enemies and they that seek evil to my lord be as nabal
1sm2527 and now this blessing which thine handmaid hath brought unto my lord let it even be given unto the young men that follow my lord
1sm2528 i pray thee forgive the trespass of thine handmaid for the lord will certainly make my lord a sure house because my lord fighteth the battles of the lord and evil hath not been found in thee all thy days
1sm2529 yet a man is risen to pursue thee and to seek thy soul but the soul of my lord shall be bound in the bundle of life with the lord thy god and the souls of thine enemies them shall he sling out as out of the middle of a sling
1sm2530 and it shall come to pass when the lord shall have done to my lord according to all the good that he hath spoken concerning thee and shall have appointed thee ruler over israel
1sm2531 that this shall be no grief unto thee nor offence of heart unto my lord either that thou hast shed blood causeless or that my lord hath avenged himself but when the lord shall have dealt well with my lord then remember thine handmaid
1sm2532 and david said to abigail blessed be the lord god of israel which sent thee this day to meet me
1sm2533 and blessed be thy advice and blessed be thou which hast kept me this day from coming to shed blood and from avenging myself with mine own hand
1sm2534 for in very deed as the lord god of israel liveth which hath kept me back from hurting thee except thou hadst hasted and come to meet me surely there had not been left unto nabal by the morning light any that pisseth against the wall
1sm2535 so david received of her hand that which she had brought him and said unto her go up in peace to thine house see i have hearkened to thy voice and have accepted thy person
1sm2536 and abigail came to nabal and behold he held a feast in his house like the feast of a king and nabal's heart was merry within him for he was very drunken wherefore she told him nothing less or more until the morning light
1sm2537 but it came to pass in the morning when the wine was gone out of nabal and his wife had told him these things that his heart died within him and he became as a stone
1sm2538 and it came to pass about ten days after that the lord smote nabal that he died
1sm2539 and when david heard that nabal was dead he said blessed be the lord that hath pleaded the cause of my reproach from the hand of nabal and hath kept his servant from evil for the lord hath returned the wickedness of nabal upon his own head and david sent and communed with abigail to take her to him to wife
1sm2540 and when the servants of david were come to abigail to carmel they spake unto her saying david sent us unto thee to take thee to him to wife
1sm2541 and she arose and bowed herself on her face to the earth and said behold let thine handmaid be a servant to wash the feet of the servants of my lord
1sm2542 and abigail hasted and arose and rode upon an ass with five damsels of hers that went after her and she went after the messengers of david and became his wife
1sm2543 david also took ahinoam of jezreel and they were also both of them his wives
1sm2544 but saul had given michal his daughter david's wife to phalti the son of laish which was of gallim
1sm261 and the ziphites came unto saul to gibeah saying doth not david hide himself in the hill of hachilah which is before jeshimon
1sm262 then saul arose and went down to the wilderness of ziph having three thousand chosen men of israel with him to seek david in the wilderness of ziph
1sm263 and saul pitched in the hill of hachilah which is before jeshimon by the way but david abode in the wilderness and he saw that saul came after him into the wilderness
1sm264 david therefore sent out spies and understood that saul was come in very deed
1sm265 and david arose and came to the place where saul had pitched and david beheld the place where saul lay and abner the son of ner the captain of his host and saul lay in the trench and the people pitched round about him
1sm266 then answered david and said to ahimelech the hittite and to abishai the son of zeruiah brother to joab saying who will go down with me to saul to the camp and abishai said i will go down with thee
1sm267 so david and abishai came to the people by night and behold saul lay sleeping within the trench and his spear stuck in the ground at his bolster but abner and the people lay round about him
1sm268 then said abishai to david god hath delivered thine enemy into thine hand this day now therefore let me smite him i pray thee with the spear even to the earth at once and i will not smite him the second time
1sm269 and david said to abishai destroy him not for who can stretch forth his hand against the lord's anointed and be guiltless
1sm2610 david said furthermore as the lord liveth the lord shall smite him or his day shall come to die or he shall descend into battle and perish
1sm2611 the lord forbid that i should stretch forth mine hand against the lord's anointed but i pray thee take thou now the spear that is at his bolster and the cruse of water and let us go
1sm2612 so david took the spear and the cruse of water from saul's bolster and they gat them away and no man saw it nor knew it neither awaked for they were all asleep because a deep sleep from the lord was fallen upon them
1sm2613 then david went over to the other side and stood on the top of an hill afar off a great space being between them
1sm2614 and david cried to the people and to abner the son of ner saying answerest thou not abner then abner answered and said who art thou that criest to the king
1sm2615 and david said to abner art not thou a valiant man and who is like to thee in israel wherefore then hast thou not kept thy lord the king for there came one of the people in to destroy the king thy lord
1sm2616 this thing is not good that thou hast done as the lord liveth ye are worthy to die because ye have not kept your master the lord's anointed and now see where the king's spear is and the cruse of water that was at his bolster
1sm2617 and saul knew david's voice and said is this thy voice my son david and david said it is my voice my lord o king
1sm2618 and he said wherefore doth my lord thus pursue after his servant for what have i done or what evil is in mine hand
1sm2619 now therefore i pray thee let my lord the king hear the words of his servant if the lord have stirred thee up against me let him accept an offering but if they be the children of men cursed be they before the lord for they have driven me out this day from abiding in the inheritance of the lord saying go serve other gods
1sm2620 now therefore let not my blood fall to the earth before the face of the lord for the king of israel is come out to seek a flea as when one doth hunt a partridge in the mountains
1sm2621 then said saul i have sinned return my son david for i will no more do thee harm because my soul was precious in thine eyes this day behold i have played the fool and have erred exceedingly
1sm2622 and david answered and said behold the king's spear and let one of the young men come over and fetch it
1sm2623 the lord render to every man his righteousness and his faithfulness for the lord delivered thee into my hand to day but i would not stretch forth mine hand against the lord's anointed
1sm2624 and behold as thy life was much set by this day in mine eyes so let my life be much set by in the eyes of the lord and let him deliver me out of all tribulation
1sm2625 then saul said to david blessed be thou my son david thou shalt both do great things and also shalt still prevail so david went on his way and saul returned to his place
1sm271 and david said in his heart i shall now perish one day by the hand of saul there is nothing better for me than that i should speedily escape into the land of the philistines and saul shall despair of me to seek me any more in any coast of israel so shall i escape out of his hand
1sm272 and david arose and he passed over with the six hundred men that were with him unto achish the son of maoch king of gath
1sm273 and david dwelt with achish at gath he and his men every man with his household even david with his two wives ahinoam the jezreelitess and abigail the carmelitess nabal's wife
1sm274 and it was told saul that david was fled to gath and he sought no more again for him
1sm275 and david said unto achish if i have now found grace in thine eyes let them give me a place in some town in the country that i may dwell there for why should thy servant dwell in the royal city with thee
1sm276 then achish gave him ziklag that day wherefore ziklag pertaineth unto the kings of judah unto this day
1sm277 and the time that david dwelt in the country of the philistines was a full year and four months
1sm278 and david and his men went up and invaded the geshurites and the gezrites and the amalekites for those nations were of old the inhabitants of the land as thou goest to shur even unto the land of egypt
1sm279 and david smote the land and left neither man nor woman alive and took away the sheep and the oxen and the asses and the camels and the apparel and returned and came to achish
1sm2710 and achish said whither have ye made a road to day and david said against the south of judah and against the south of the jerahmeelites and against the south of the kenites
1sm2711 and david saved neither man nor woman alive to bring tidings to gath saying lest they should tell on us saying so did david and so will be his manner all the while he dwelleth in the country of the philistines
1sm2712 and achish believed david saying he hath made his people israel utterly to abhor him therefore he shall be my servant for ever
1sm281 and it came to pass in those days that the philistines gathered their armies together for warfare to fight with israel and achish said unto david know thou assuredly that thou shalt go out with me to battle thou and thy men
1sm282 and david said to achish surely thou shalt know what thy servant can do and achish said to david therefore will i make thee keeper of mine head for ever
1sm283 now samuel was dead and all israel had lamented him and buried him in ramah even in his own city and saul had put away those that had familiar spirits and the wizards out of the land
1sm284 and the philistines gathered themselves together and came and pitched in shunem and saul gathered all israel together and they pitched in gilboa
1sm285 and when saul saw the host of the philistines he was afraid and his heart greatly trembled
1sm286 and when saul enquired of the lord the lord answered him not neither by dreams nor by urim nor by prophets
1sm287 then said saul unto his servants seek me a woman that hath a familiar spirit that i may go to her and enquire of her and his servants said to him behold there is a woman that hath a familiar spirit at endor
1sm288 and saul disguised himself and put on other raiment and he went and two men with him and they came to the woman by night and he said i pray thee divine unto me by the familiar spirit and bring me him up whom i shall name unto thee
1sm289 and the woman said unto him behold thou knowest what saul hath done how he hath cut off those that have familiar spirits and the wizards out of the land wherefore then layest thou a snare for my life to cause me to die
1sm2810 and saul sware to her by the lord saying as the lord liveth there shall no punishment happen to thee for this thing
1sm2811 then said the woman whom shall i bring up unto thee and he said bring me up samuel
1sm2812 and when the woman saw samuel she cried with a loud voice and the woman spake to saul saying why hast thou deceived me for thou art saul
1sm2813 and the king said unto her be not afraid for what sawest thou and the woman said unto saul i saw gods ascending out of the earth
1sm2814 and he said unto her what form is he of and she said an old man cometh up and he is covered with a mantle and saul perceived that it was samuel and he stooped with his face to the ground and bowed himself
1sm2815 and samuel said to saul why hast thou disquieted me to bring me up and saul answered i am sore distressed for the philistines make war against me and god is departed from me and answereth me no more neither by prophets nor by dreams therefore i have called thee that thou mayest make known unto me what i shall do
1sm2816 then said samuel wherefore then dost thou ask of me seeing the lord is departed from thee and is become thine enemy
1sm2817 and the lord hath done to him as he spake by me for the lord hath rent the kingdom out of thine hand and given it to thy neighbour even to david
1sm2818 because thou obeyedst not the voice of the lord nor executedst his fierce wrath upon amalek therefore hath the lord done this thing unto thee this day
1sm2819 moreover the lord will also deliver israel with thee into the hand of the philistines and to morrow shalt thou and thy sons be with me the lord also shall deliver the host of israel into the hand of the philistines
1sm2820 then saul fell straightway all along on the earth and was sore afraid because of the words of samuel and there was no strength in him for he had eaten no bread all the day nor all the night
1sm2821 and the woman came unto saul and saw that he was sore troubled and said unto him behold thine handmaid hath obeyed thy voice and i have put my life in my hand and have hearkened unto thy words which thou spakest unto me
1sm2822 now therefore i pray thee hearken thou also unto the voice of thine handmaid and let me set a morsel of bread before thee and eat that thou mayest have strength when thou goest on thy way
1sm2823 but he refused and said i will not eat but his servants together with the woman compelled him and he hearkened unto their voice so he arose from the earth and sat upon the bed
1sm2824 and the woman had a fat calf in the house and she hasted and killed it and took flour and kneaded it and did bake unleavened bread thereof
1sm2825 and she brought it before saul and before his servants and they did eat then they rose up and went away that night
1sm291 now the philistines gathered together all their armies to aphek and the israelites pitched by a fountain which is in jezreel
1sm292 and the lords of the philistines passed on by hundreds and by thousands but david and his men passed on in the rereward with achish
1sm293 then said the princes of the philistines what do these hebrews here and achish said unto the princes of the philistines is not this david the servant of saul the king of israel which hath been with me these days or these years and i have found no fault in him since he fell unto me unto this day
1sm294 and the princes of the philistines were wroth with him and the princes of the philistines said unto him make this fellow return that he may go again to his place which thou hast appointed him and let him not go down with us to battle lest in the battle he be an adversary to us for wherewith should he reconcile himself unto his master should it not be with the heads of these men
1sm295 is not this david of whom they sang one to another in dances saying saul slew his thousands and david his ten thousands
1sm296 then achish called david and said unto him surely as the lord liveth thou hast been upright and thy going out and thy coming in with me in the host is good in my sight for i have not found evil in thee since the day of thy coming unto me unto this day nevertheless the lords favour thee not
1sm297 wherefore now return and go in peace that thou displease not the lords of the philistines
1sm298 and david said unto achish but what have i done and what hast thou found in thy servant so long as i have been with thee unto this day that i may not go fight against the enemies of my lord the king
1sm299 and achish answered and said to david i know that thou art good in my sight as an angel of god notwithstanding the princes of the philistines have said he shall not go up with us to the battle
1sm2910 wherefore now rise up early in the morning with thy master's servants that are come with thee and as soon as ye be up early in the morning and have light depart
1sm2911 so david and his men rose up early to depart in the morning to return into the land of the philistines and the philistines went up to jezreel
1sm301 and it came to pass when david and his men were come to ziklag on the third day that the amalekites had invaded the south and ziklag and smitten ziklag and burned it with fire
1sm302 and had taken the women captives that were therein they slew not any either great or small but carried them away and went on their way
1sm303 so david and his men came to the city and behold it was burned with fire and their wives and their sons and their daughters were taken captives
1sm304 then david and the people that were with him lifted up their voice and wept until they had no more power to weep
1sm305 and david's two wives were taken captives ahinoam the jezreelitess and abigail the wife of nabal the carmelite
1sm306 and david was greatly distressed for the people spake of stoning him because the soul of all the people was grieved every man for his sons and for his daughters but david encouraged himself in the lord his god
1sm307 and david said to abiathar the priest ahimelech's son i pray thee bring me hither the ephod and abiathar brought thither the ephod to david
1sm308 and david enquired at the lord saying shall i pursue after this troop shall i overtake them and he answered him pursue for thou shalt surely overtake them and without fail recover all
1sm309 so david went he and the six hundred men that were with him and came to the brook besor where those that were left behind stayed
1sm3010 but david pursued he and four hundred men for two hundred abode behind which were so faint that they could not go over the brook besor
1sm3011 and they found an egyptian in the field and brought him to david and gave him bread and he did eat and they made him drink water
1sm3012 and they gave him a piece of a cake of figs and two clusters of raisins and when he had eaten his spirit came again to him for he had eaten no bread nor drunk any water three days and three nights
1sm3013 and david said unto him to whom belongest thou and whence art thou and he said i am a young man of egypt servant to an amalekite and my master left me because three days agone i fell sick
1sm3014 we made an invasion upon the south of the cherethites and upon the coast which belongeth to judah and upon the south of caleb and we burned ziklag with fire
1sm3015 and david said to him canst thou bring me down to this company and he said swear unto me by god that thou wilt neither kill me nor deliver me into the hands of my master and i will bring thee down to this company
1sm3016 and when he had brought him down behold they were spread abroad upon all the earth eating and drinking and dancing because of all the great spoil that they had taken out of the land of the philistines and out of the land of judah
1sm3017 and david smote them from the twilight even unto the evening of the next day and there escaped not a man of them save four hundred young men which rode upon camels and fled
1sm3018 and david recovered all that the amalekites had carried away and david rescued his two wives
1sm3019 and there was nothing lacking to them neither small nor great neither sons nor daughters neither spoil nor any thing that they had taken to them david recovered all
