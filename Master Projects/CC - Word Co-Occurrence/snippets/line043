2sm2118 and it came to pass after this that there was again a battle with the philistines at gob then sibbechai the hushathite slew saph which was of the sons of the giant
2sm2119 and there was again a battle in gob with the philistines where elhanan the son of jaareoregim a bethlehemite slew the brother of goliath the gittite the staff of whose spear was like a weaver's beam
2sm2120 and there was yet a battle in gath where was a man of great stature that had on every hand six fingers and on every foot six toes four and twenty in number and he also was born to the giant
2sm2121 and when he defied israel jonathan the son of shimeah the brother of david slew him
2sm2122 these four were born to the giant in gath and fell by the hand of david and by the hand of his servants
2sm221 and david spake unto the lord the words of this song in the day that the lord had delivered him out of the hand of all his enemies and out of the hand of saul
2sm222 and he said the lord is my rock and my fortress and my deliverer
2sm223 the god of my rock in him will i trust he is my shield and the horn of my salvation my high tower and my refuge my saviour thou savest me from violence
2sm224 i will call on the lord who is worthy to be praised so shall i be saved from mine enemies
2sm225 when the waves of death compassed me the floods of ungodly men made me afraid
2sm226 the sorrows of hell compassed me about the snares of death prevented me
2sm227 in my distress i called upon the lord and cried to my god and he did hear my voice out of his temple and my cry did enter into his ears
2sm228 then the earth shook and trembled the foundations of heaven moved and shook because he was wroth
2sm229 there went up a smoke out of his nostrils and fire out of his mouth devoured coals were kindled by it
2sm2210 he bowed the heavens also and came down and darkness was under his feet
2sm2211 and he rode upon a cherub and did fly and he was seen upon the wings of the wind
2sm2212 and he made darkness pavilions round about him dark waters and thick clouds of the skies
2sm2213 through the brightness before him were coals of fire kindled
2sm2214 the lord thundered from heaven and the most high uttered his voice
2sm2215 and he sent out arrows and scattered them lightning and discomfited them
2sm2216 and the channels of the sea appeared the foundations of the world were discovered at the rebuking of the lord at the blast of the breath of his nostrils
2sm2217 he sent from above he took me he drew me out of many waters
2sm2218 he delivered me from my strong enemy and from them that hated me for they were too strong for me
2sm2219 they prevented me in the day of my calamity but the lord was my stay
2sm2220 he brought me forth also into a large place he delivered me because he delighted in me
2sm2221 the lord rewarded me according to my righteousness according to the cleanness of my hands hath he recompensed me
2sm2222 for i have kept the ways of the lord and have not wickedly departed from my god
2sm2223 for all his judgments were before me and as for his statutes i did not depart from them
2sm2224 i was also upright before him and have kept myself from mine iniquity
2sm2225 therefore the lord hath recompensed me according to my righteousness according to my cleanness in his eye sight
2sm2226 with the merciful thou wilt shew thyself merciful and with the upright man thou wilt shew thyself upright
2sm2227 with the pure thou wilt shew thyself pure and with the froward thou wilt shew thyself unsavoury
2sm2228 and the afflicted people thou wilt save but thine eyes are upon the haughty that thou mayest bring them down
2sm2229 for thou art my lamp o lord and the lord will lighten my darkness
2sm2230 for by thee i have run through a troop by my god have i leaped over a wall
2sm2231 as for god his way is perfect the word of the lord is tried he is a buckler to all them that trust in him
2sm2232 for who is god save the lord and who is a rock save our god
2sm2233 god is my strength and power and he maketh my way perfect
2sm2234 he maketh my feet like hinds feet and setteth me upon my high places
2sm2235 he teacheth my hands to war so that a bow of steel is broken by mine arms
2sm2236 thou hast also given me the shield of thy salvation and thy gentleness hath made me great
2sm2237 thou hast enlarged my steps under me so that my feet did not slip
2sm2238 i have pursued mine enemies and destroyed them and turned not again until i had consumed them
2sm2239 and i have consumed them and wounded them that they could not arise yea they are fallen under my feet
2sm2240 for thou hast girded me with strength to battle them that rose up against me hast thou subdued under me
2sm2241 thou hast also given me the necks of mine enemies that i might destroy them that hate me
2sm2242 they looked but there was none to save even unto the lord but he answered them not
2sm2243 then did i beat them as small as the dust of the earth i did stamp them as the mire of the street and did spread them abroad
2sm2244 thou also hast delivered me from the strivings of my people thou hast kept me to be head of the heathen a people which i knew not shall serve me
2sm2245 strangers shall submit themselves unto me as soon as they hear they shall be obedient unto me
2sm2246 strangers shall fade away and they shall be afraid out of their close places
2sm2247 the lord liveth and blessed be my rock and exalted be the god of the rock of my salvation
2sm2248 it is god that avengeth me and that bringeth down the people under me
2sm2249 and that bringeth me forth from mine enemies thou also hast lifted me up on high above them that rose up against me thou hast delivered me from the violent man
2sm2250 therefore i will give thanks unto thee o lord among the heathen and i will sing praises unto thy name
2sm2251 he is the tower of salvation for his king and sheweth mercy to his anointed unto david and to his seed for evermore
2sm231 now these be the last words of david david the son of jesse said and the man who was raised up on high the anointed of the god of jacob and the sweet psalmist of israel said
2sm232 the spirit of the lord spake by me and his word was in my tongue
2sm233 the god of israel said the rock of israel spake to me he that ruleth over men must be just ruling in the fear of god
2sm234 and he shall be as the light of the morning when the sun riseth even a morning without clouds as the tender grass springing out of the earth by clear shining after rain
2sm235 although my house be not so with god yet he hath made with me an everlasting covenant ordered in all things and sure for this is all my salvation and all my desire although he make it not to grow
2sm236 but the sons of belial shall be all of them as thorns thrust away because they cannot be taken with hands
2sm237 but the man that shall touch them must be fenced with iron and the staff of a spear and they shall be utterly burned with fire in the same place
2sm238 these be the names of the mighty men whom david had the tachmonite that sat in the seat chief among the captains the same was adino the eznite he lift up his spear against eight hundred whom he slew at one time
2sm239 and after him was eleazar the son of dodo the ahohite one of the three mighty men with david when they defied the philistines that were there gathered together to battle and the men of israel were gone away
2sm2310 he arose and smote the philistines until his hand was weary and his hand clave unto the sword and the lord wrought a great victory that day and the people returned after him only to spoil
2sm2311 and after him was shammah the son of agee the hararite and the philistines were gathered together into a troop where was a piece of ground full of lentiles and the people fled from the philistines
2sm2312 but he stood in the midst of the ground and defended it and slew the philistines and the lord wrought a great victory
2sm2313 and three of the thirty chief went down and came to david in the harvest time unto the cave of adullam and the troop of the philistines pitched in the valley of rephaim
2sm2314 and david was then in an hold and the garrison of the philistines was then in bethlehem
2sm2315 and david longed and said oh that one would give me drink of the water of the well of bethlehem which is by the gate
2sm2316 and the three mighty men brake through the host of the philistines and drew water out of the well of bethlehem that was by the gate and took it and brought it to david nevertheless he would not drink thereof but poured it out unto the lord
2sm2317 and he said be it far from me o lord that i should do this is not this the blood of the men that went in jeopardy of their lives therefore he would not drink it these things did these three mighty men
2sm2318 and abishai the brother of joab the son of zeruiah was chief among three and he lifted up his spear against three hundred and slew them and had the name among three
2sm2319 was he not most honourable of three therefore he was their captain howbeit he attained not unto the first three
2sm2320 and benaiah the son of jehoiada the son of a valiant man of kabzeel who had done many acts he slew two lionlike men of moab he went down also and slew a lion in the midst of a pit in time of snow
2sm2321 and he slew an egyptian a goodly man and the egyptian had a spear in his hand but he went down to him with a staff and plucked the spear out of the egyptian's hand and slew him with his own spear
2sm2322 these things did benaiah the son of jehoiada and had the name among three mighty men
2sm2323 he was more honourable than the thirty but he attained not to the first three and david set him over his guard
2sm2324 asahel the brother of joab was one of the thirty elhanan the son of dodo of bethlehem
2sm2325 shammah the harodite elika the harodite
2sm2326 helez the paltite ira the son of ikkesh the tekoite
2sm2327 abiezer the anethothite mebunnai the hushathite
2sm2328 zalmon the ahohite maharai the netophathite
2sm2329 heleb the son of baanah a netophathite ittai the son of ribai out of gibeah of the children of benjamin
2sm2330 benaiah the pirathonite hiddai of the brooks of gaash
2sm2331 abialbon the arbathite azmaveth the barhumite
2sm2332 eliahba the shaalbonite of the sons of jashen jonathan
2sm2333 shammah the hararite ahiam the son of sharar the hararite
2sm2334 eliphelet the son of ahasbai the son of the maachathite eliam the son of ahithophel the gilonite
2sm2335 hezrai the carmelite paarai the arbite
2sm2336 igal the son of nathan of zobah bani the gadite
2sm2337 zelek the ammonite nahari the beerothite armourbearer to joab the son of zeruiah
2sm2338 ira an ithrite gareb an ithrite
2sm2339 uriah the hittite thirty and seven in all
2sm241 and again the anger of the lord was kindled against israel and he moved david against them to say go number israel and judah
2sm242 for the king said to joab the captain of the host which was with him go now through all the tribes of israel from dan even to beersheba and number ye the people that i may know the number of the people
2sm243 and joab said unto the king now the lord thy god add unto the people how many soever they be an hundredfold and that the eyes of my lord the king may see it but why doth my lord the king delight in this thing
2sm244 notwithstanding the king's word prevailed against joab and against the captains of the host and joab and the captains of the host went out from the presence of the king to number the people of israel
2sm245 and they passed over jordan and pitched in aroer on the right side of the city that lieth in the midst of the river of gad and toward jazer
2sm246 then they came to gilead and to the land of tahtimhodshi and they came to danjaan and about to zidon
2sm247 and came to the strong hold of tyre and to all the cities of the hivites and of the canaanites and they went out to the south of judah even to beersheba
2sm248 so when they had gone through all the land they came to jerusalem at the end of nine months and twenty days
2sm249 and joab gave up the sum of the number of the people unto the king and there were in israel eight hundred thousand valiant men that drew the sword and the men of judah were five hundred thousand men
2sm2410 and david's heart smote him after that he had numbered the people and david said unto the lord i have sinned greatly in that i have done and now i beseech thee o lord take away the iniquity of thy servant for i have done very foolishly
2sm2411 for when david was up in the morning the word of the lord came unto the prophet gad david's seer saying
2sm2412 go and say unto david thus saith the lord i offer thee three things choose thee one of them that i may do it unto thee
2sm2413 so gad came to david and told him and said unto him shall seven years of famine come unto thee in thy land or wilt thou flee three months before thine enemies while they pursue thee or that there be three days pestilence in thy land now advise and see what answer i shall return to him that sent me
2sm2414 and david said unto gad i am in a great strait let us fall now into the hand of the lord for his mercies are great and let me not fall into the hand of man
2sm2415 so the lord sent a pestilence upon israel from the morning even to the time appointed and there died of the people from dan even to beersheba seventy thousand men
2sm2416 and when the angel stretched out his hand upon jerusalem to destroy it the lord repented him of the evil and said to the angel that destroyed the people it is enough stay now thine hand and the angel of the lord was by the threshingplace of araunah the jebusite
2sm2417 and david spake unto the lord when he saw the angel that smote the people and said lo i have sinned and i have done wickedly but these sheep what have they done let thine hand i pray thee be against me and against my father's house
2sm2418 and gad came that day to david and said unto him go up rear an altar unto the lord in the threshingfloor of araunah the jebusite
2sm2419 and david according to the saying of gad went up as the lord commanded
2sm2420 and araunah looked and saw the king and his servants coming on toward him and araunah went out and bowed himself before the king on his face upon the ground
2sm2421 and araunah said wherefore is my lord the king come to his servant and david said to buy the threshingfloor of thee to build an altar unto the lord that the plague may be stayed from the people
2sm2422 and araunah said unto david let my lord the king take and offer up what seemeth good unto him behold here be oxen for burnt sacrifice and threshing instruments and other instruments of the oxen for wood
2sm2423 all these things did araunah as a king give unto the king and araunah said unto the king the lord thy god accept thee
2sm2424 and the king said unto araunah nay but i will surely buy it of thee at a price neither will i offer burnt offerings unto the lord my god of that which doth cost me nothing so david bought the threshingfloor and the oxen for fifty shekels of silver
2sm2425 and david built there an altar unto the lord and offered burnt offerings and peace offerings so the lord was intreated for the land and the plague was stayed from israel
1ki11 now king david was old and stricken in years and they covered him with clothes but he gat no heat
1ki12 wherefore his servants said unto him let there be sought for my lord the king a young virgin and let her stand before the king and let her cherish him and let her lie in thy bosom that my lord the king may get heat
1ki13 so they sought for a fair damsel throughout all the coasts of israel and found abishag a shunammite and brought her to the king
1ki14 and the damsel was very fair and cherished the king and ministered to him but the king knew her not
1ki15 then adonijah the son of haggith exalted himself saying i will be king and he prepared him chariots and horsemen and fifty men to run before him
1ki16 and his father had not displeased him at any time in saying why hast thou done so and he also was a very goodly man and his mother bare him after absalom
1ki17 and he conferred with joab the son of zeruiah and with abiathar the priest and they following adonijah helped him
1ki18 but zadok the priest and benaiah the son of jehoiada and nathan the prophet and shimei and rei and the mighty men which belonged to david were not with adonijah
1ki19 and adonijah slew sheep and oxen and fat cattle by the stone of zoheleth which is by enrogel and called all his brethren the king's sons and all the men of judah the king's servants
1ki110 but nathan the prophet and benaiah and the mighty men and solomon his brother he called not
1ki111 wherefore nathan spake unto bathsheba the mother of solomon saying hast thou not heard that adonijah the son of haggith doth reign and david our lord knoweth it not
1ki112 now therefore come let me i pray thee give thee counsel that thou mayest save thine own life and the life of thy son solomon
1ki113 go and get thee in unto king david and say unto him didst not thou my lord o king swear unto thine handmaid saying assuredly solomon thy son shall reign after me and he shall sit upon my throne why then doth adonijah reign
1ki114 behold while thou yet talkest there with the king i also will come in after thee and confirm thy words
1ki115 and bathsheba went in unto the king into the chamber and the king was very old and abishag the shunammite ministered unto the king
1ki116 and bathsheba bowed and did obeisance unto the king and the king said what wouldest thou
1ki117 and she said unto him my lord thou swarest by the lord thy god unto thine handmaid saying assuredly solomon thy son shall reign after me and he shall sit upon my throne
1ki118 and now behold adonijah reigneth and now my lord the king thou knowest it not
1ki119 and he hath slain oxen and fat cattle and sheep in abundance and hath called all the sons of the king and abiathar the priest and joab the captain of the host but solomon thy servant hath he not called
1ki120 and thou my lord o king the eyes of all israel are upon thee that thou shouldest tell them who shall sit on the throne of my lord the king after him
1ki121 otherwise it shall come to pass when my lord the king shall sleep with his fathers that i and my son solomon shall be counted offenders
1ki122 and lo while she yet talked with the king nathan the prophet also came in
1ki123 and they told the king saying behold nathan the prophet and when he was come in before the king he bowed himself before the king with his face to the ground
1ki124 and nathan said my lord o king hast thou said adonijah shall reign after me and he shall sit upon my throne
1ki125 for he is gone down this day and hath slain oxen and fat cattle and sheep in abundance and hath called all the king's sons and the captains of the host and abiathar the priest and behold they eat and drink before him and say god save king adonijah
1ki126 but me even me thy servant and zadok the priest and benaiah the son of jehoiada and thy servant solomon hath he not called
1ki127 is this thing done by my lord the king and thou hast not shewed it unto thy servant who should sit on the throne of my lord the king after him
1ki128 then king david answered and said call me bathsheba and she came into the king's presence and stood before the king
1ki129 and the king sware and said as the lord liveth that hath redeemed my soul out of all distress
1ki130 even as i sware unto thee by the lord god of israel saying assuredly solomon thy son shall reign after me and he shall sit upon my throne in my stead even so will i certainly do this day
1ki131 then bathsheba bowed with her face to the earth and did reverence to the king and said let my lord king david live for ever
1ki132 and king david said call me zadok the priest and nathan the prophet and benaiah the son of jehoiada and they came before the king
1ki133 the king also said unto them take with you the servants of your lord and cause solomon my son to ride upon mine own mule and bring him down to gihon
1ki134 and let zadok the priest and nathan the prophet anoint him there king over israel and blow ye with the trumpet and say god save king solomon
1ki135 then ye shall come up after him that he may come and sit upon my throne for he shall be king in my stead and i have appointed him to be ruler over israel and over judah
1ki136 and benaiah the son of jehoiada answered the king and said amen the lord god of my lord the king say so too
1ki137 as the lord hath been with my lord the king even so be he with solomon and make his throne greater than the throne of my lord king david
1ki138 so zadok the priest and nathan the prophet and benaiah the son of jehoiada and the cherethites and the pelethites went down and caused solomon to ride upon king david's mule and brought him to gihon
1ki139 and zadok the priest took an horn of oil out of the tabernacle and anointed solomon and they blew the trumpet and all the people said god save king solomon
1ki140 and all the people came up after him and the people piped with pipes and rejoiced with great joy so that the earth rent with the sound of them
1ki141 and adonijah and all the guests that were with him heard it as they had made an end of eating and when joab heard the sound of the trumpet he said wherefore is this noise of the city being in an uproar
1ki142 and while he yet spake behold jonathan the son of abiathar the priest came and adonijah said unto him come in for thou art a valiant man and bringest good tidings
1ki143 and jonathan answered and said to adonijah verily our lord king david hath made solomon king
1ki144 and the king hath sent with him zadok the priest and nathan the prophet and benaiah the son of jehoiada and the cherethites and the pelethites and they have caused him to ride upon the king's mule
1ki145 and zadok the priest and nathan the prophet have anointed him king in gihon and they are come up from thence rejoicing so that the city rang again this is the noise that ye have heard
1ki146 and also solomon sitteth on the throne of the kingdom
1ki147 and moreover the king's servants came to bless our lord king david saying god make the name of solomon better than thy name and make his throne greater than thy throne and the king bowed himself upon the bed
1ki148 and also thus said the king blessed be the lord god of israel which hath given one to sit on my throne this day mine eyes even seeing it
1ki149 and all the guests that were with adonijah were afraid and rose up and went every man his way
1ki150 and adonijah feared because of solomon and arose and went and caught hold on the horns of the altar
1ki151 and it was told solomon saying behold adonijah feareth king solomon for lo he hath caught hold on the horns of the altar saying let king solomon swear unto me today that he will not slay his servant with the sword
1ki152 and solomon said if he will shew himself a worthy man there shall not an hair of him fall to the earth but if wickedness shall be found in him he shall die
1ki153 so king solomon sent and they brought him down from the altar and he came and bowed himself to king solomon and solomon said unto him go to thine house
1ki21 now the days of david drew nigh that he should die and he charged solomon his son saying
1ki22 i go the way of all the earth be thou strong therefore and shew thyself a man
1ki23 and keep the charge of the lord thy god to walk in his ways to keep his statutes and his commandments and his judgments and his testimonies as it is written in the law of moses that thou mayest prosper in all that thou doest and whithersoever thou turnest thyself
1ki24 that the lord may continue his word which he spake concerning me saying if thy children take heed to their way to walk before me in truth with all their heart and with all their soul there shall not fail thee said he a man on the throne of israel
1ki25 moreover thou knowest also what joab the son of zeruiah did to me and what he did to the two captains of the hosts of israel unto abner the son of ner and unto amasa the son of jether whom he slew and shed the blood of war in peace and put the blood of war upon his girdle that was about his loins and in his shoes that were on his feet
1ki26 do therefore according to thy wisdom and let not his hoar head go down to the grave in peace
1ki27 but shew kindness unto the sons of barzillai the gileadite and let them be of those that eat at thy table for so they came to me when i fled because of absalom thy brother
1ki28 and behold thou hast with thee shimei the son of gera a benjamite of bahurim which cursed me with a grievous curse in the day when i went to mahanaim but he came down to meet me at jordan and i sware to him by the lord saying i will not put thee to death with the sword
1ki29 now therefore hold him not guiltless for thou art a wise man and knowest what thou oughtest to do unto him but his hoar head bring thou down to the grave with blood
1ki210 so david slept with his fathers and was buried in the city of david
1ki211 and the days that david reigned over israel were forty years seven years reigned he in hebron and thirty and three years reigned he in jerusalem
1ki212 then sat solomon upon the throne of david his father and his kingdom was established greatly
1ki213 and adonijah the son of haggith came to bathsheba the mother of solomon and she said comest thou peaceably and he said peaceably
1ki214 he said moreover i have somewhat to say unto thee and she said say on
1ki215 and he said thou knowest that the kingdom was mine and that all israel set their faces on me that i should reign howbeit the kingdom is turned about and is become my brother's for it was his from the lord
1ki216 and now i ask one petition of thee deny me not and she said unto him say on
1ki217 and he said speak i pray thee unto solomon the king for he will not say thee nay that he give me abishag the shunammite to wife
1ki218 and bathsheba said well i will speak for thee unto the king
1ki219 bathsheba therefore went unto king solomon to speak unto him for adonijah and the king rose up to meet her and bowed himself unto her and sat down on his throne and caused a seat to be set for the king's mother and she sat on his right hand
1ki220 then she said i desire one small petition of thee i pray thee say me not nay and the king said unto her ask on my mother for i will not say thee nay
1ki221 and she said let abishag the shunammite be given to adonijah thy brother to wife
1ki222 and king solomon answered and said unto his mother and why dost thou ask abishag the shunammite for adonijah ask for him the kingdom also for he is mine elder brother even for him and for abiathar the priest and for joab the son of zeruiah
1ki223 then king solomon sware by the lord saying god do so to me and more also if adonijah have not spoken this word against his own life
1ki224 now therefore as the lord liveth which hath established me and set me on the throne of david my father and who hath made me an house as he promised adonijah shall be put to death this day
1ki225 and king solomon sent by the hand of benaiah the son of jehoiada and he fell upon him that he died
1ki226 and unto abiathar the priest said the king get thee to anathoth unto thine own fields for thou art worthy of death but i will not at this time put thee to death because thou barest the ark of the lord god before david my father and because thou hast been afflicted in all wherein my father was afflicted
1ki227 so solomon thrust out abiathar from being priest unto the lord that he might fulfil the word of the lord which he spake concerning the house of eli in shiloh
