cleopatra most kind messenger
 say to great caesar this in deputation
 i kiss his conquering hand tell him i am prompt
 to lay my crown at s feet and there to kneel
 tell him from his allobeying breath i hear
 the doom of egypt
thyreus tis your noblest course
 wisdom and fortune combating together
 if that the former dare but what it can
 no chance may shake it give me grace to lay
 my duty on your hand
cleopatra your caesar's father oft
 when he hath mused of taking kingdoms in
 bestow'd his lips on that unworthy place
 as it rain'd kisses
 reenter mark antony and domitius enobarbus
mark antony favours by jove that thunders
 what art thou fellow
thyreus one that but performs
 the bidding of the fullest man and worthiest
 to have command obey'd
domitius enobarbus aside you will be whipp'd
mark antony approach there ah you kite now gods
 and devils
 authority melts from me of late when i cried ho'
 like boys unto a muss kings would start forth
 and cry your will have you no ears i am
 antony yet
 enter attendants
 take hence this jack and whip him
domitius enobarbus aside tis better playing with a lion's whelp
 than with an old one dying
mark antony moon and stars
 whip him were't twenty of the greatest tributaries
 that do acknowledge caesar should i find them
 so saucy with the hand of she herewhat's her name
 since she was cleopatra whip him fellows
 till like a boy you see him cringe his face
 and whine aloud for mercy take him hence
thyreus mark antony
mark antony tug him away being whipp'd
 bring him again this jack of caesar's shall
 bear us an errand to him
 exeunt attendants with thyreus
 you were half blasted ere i knew you ha
 have i my pillow left unpress'd in rome
 forborne the getting of a lawful race
 and by a gem of women to be abused
 by one that looks on feeders
cleopatra good my lord
mark antony you have been a boggler ever
 but when we in our viciousness grow hard
 o misery on'tthe wise gods seel our eyes
 in our own filth drop our clear judgments make us
 adore our errors laugh at's while we strut
 to our confusion
cleopatra o is't come to this
mark antony i found you as a morsel cold upon
 dead caesar's trencher nay you were a fragment
 of cneius pompey's besides what hotter hours
 unregister'd in vulgar fame you have
 luxuriously pick'd out for i am sure
 though you can guess what temperance should be
 you know not what it is
cleopatra wherefore is this
mark antony to let a fellow that will take rewards
 and say god quit you be familiar with
 my playfellow your hand this kingly seal
 and plighter of high hearts o that i were
 upon the hill of basan to outroar
 the horned herd for i have savage cause
 and to proclaim it civilly were like
 a halter'd neck which does the hangman thank
 for being yare about him
 reenter attendants with thyreus
 is he whipp'd
first attendant soundly my lord
mark antony cried he and begg'd a pardon
first attendant he did ask favour
mark antony if that thy father live let him repent
 thou wast not made his daughter and be thou sorry
 to follow caesar in his triumph since
 thou hast been whipp'd for following him henceforth
 the white hand of a lady fever thee
 shake thou to look on t get thee back to caesar
 tell him thy entertainment look thou say
 he makes me angry with him for he seems
 proud and disdainful harping on what i am
 not what he knew i was he makes me angry
 and at this time most easy tis to do't
 when my good stars that were my former guides
 have empty left their orbs and shot their fires
 into the abysm of hell if he mislike
 my speech and what is done tell him he has
 hipparchus my enfranched bondman whom
 he may at pleasure whip or hang or torture
 as he shall like to quit me urge it thou
 hence with thy stripes begone
 exit thyreus
cleopatra have you done yet
mark antony alack our terrene moon
 is now eclipsed and it portends alone
 the fall of antony
cleopatra i must stay his time
mark antony to flatter caesar would you mingle eyes
 with one that ties his points
cleopatra not know me yet
mark antony coldhearted toward me
cleopatra ah dear if i be so
 from my cold heart let heaven engender hail
 and poison it in the source and the first stone
 drop in my neck as it determines so
 dissolve my life the next caesarion smite
 till by degrees the memory of my womb
 together with my brave egyptians all
 by the discandying of this pelleted storm
 lie graveless till the flies and gnats of nile
 have buried them for prey
mark antony i am satisfied
 caesar sits down in alexandria where
 i will oppose his fate our force by land
 hath nobly held our sever'd navy too
 have knit again and fleet threatening most sealike
 where hast thou been my heart dost thou hear lady
 if from the field i shall return once more
 to kiss these lips i will appear in blood
 i and my sword will earn our chronicle
 there's hope in't yet
cleopatra that's my brave lord
mark antony i will be treblesinew'd hearted breathed
 and fight maliciously for when mine hours
 were nice and lucky men did ransom lives
 of me for jests but now i'll set my teeth
 and send to darkness all that stop me come
 let's have one other gaudy night call to me
 all my sad captains fill our bowls once more
 let's mock the midnight bell
cleopatra it is my birthday
 i had thought to have held it poor but since my lord
 is antony again i will be cleopatra
mark antony we will yet do well
cleopatra call all his noble captains to my lord
mark antony do so we'll speak to them and tonight i'll force
 the wine peep through their scars come on my queen
 there's sap in't yet the next time i do fight
 i'll make death love me for i will contend
 even with his pestilent scythe
 exeunt all but domitius enobarbus
domitius enobarbus now he'll outstare the lightning to be furious
 is to be frighted out of fear and in that mood
 the dove will peck the estridge and i see still
 a diminution in our captain's brain
 restores his heart when valour preys on reason
 it eats the sword it fights with i will seek
 some way to leave him
 exit
 antony and cleopatra
act iv
scene i before alexandria octavius caesar's camp
 enter octavius caesar agrippa and mecaenas with
 his army octavius caesar reading a letter
octavius caesar he calls me boy and chides as he had power
 to beat me out of egypt my messenger
 he hath whipp'd with rods dares me to personal combat
 caesar to antony let the old ruffian know
 i have many other ways to die meantime
 laugh at his challenge
mecaenas caesar must think
 when one so great begins to rage he's hunted
 even to falling give him no breath but now
 make boot of his distraction never anger
 made good guard for itself
octavius caesar let our best heads
 know that tomorrow the last of many battles
 we mean to fight within our files there are
 of those that served mark antony but late
 enough to fetch him in see it done
 and feast the army we have store to do't
 and they have earn'd the waste poor antony
 exeunt
