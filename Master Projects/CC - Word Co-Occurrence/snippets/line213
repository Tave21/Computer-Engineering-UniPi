 you must sing adown adown
 an you call him adowna
 o how the wheel becomes it it is the false
 steward that stole his master's daughter
laertes this nothing's more than matter
ophelia there's rosemary that's for remembrance pray
 love remember and there is pansies that's for thoughts
laertes a document in madness thoughts and remembrance fitted
ophelia there's fennel for you and columbines there's rue
 for you and here's some for me we may call it
 herbgrace o sundays o you must wear your rue with
 a difference there's a daisy i would give you
 some violets but they withered all when my father
 died they say he made a good end
 sings
 for bonny sweet robin is all my joy
laertes thought and affliction passion hell itself
 she turns to favour and to prettiness
ophelia sings
 and will he not come again
 and will he not come again
 no no he is dead
 go to thy deathbed
 he never will come again
 his beard was as white as snow
 all flaxen was his poll
 he is gone he is gone
 and we cast away moan
 god ha mercy on his soul
 and of all christian souls i pray god god be wi ye
 exit
laertes do you see this o god
king claudius laertes i must commune with your grief
 or you deny me right go but apart
 make choice of whom your wisest friends you will
 and they shall hear and judge twixt you and me
 if by direct or by collateral hand
 they find us touch'd we will our kingdom give
 our crown our life and all that we can ours
 to you in satisfaction but if not
 be you content to lend your patience to us
 and we shall jointly labour with your soul
 to give it due content
laertes let this be so
 his means of death his obscure funeral
 no trophy sword nor hatchment o'er his bones
 no noble rite nor formal ostentation
 cry to be heard as twere from heaven to earth
 that i must call't in question
king claudius so you shall
 and where the offence is let the great axe fall
 i pray you go with me

 enter horatio and a servant
horatio what are they that would speak with me
servant sailors sir they say they have letters for you
horatio let them come in
 exit servant
 i do not know from what part of the world
 i should be greeted if not from lord hamlet
 enter sailors
first sailor god bless you sir
horatio let him bless thee too
first sailor he shall sir an't please him there's a letter for
 you sir it comes from the ambassador that was
 bound for england if your name be horatio as i am
 let to know it is
horatio reads horatio when thou shalt have overlooked
 this give these fellows some means to the king
 they have letters for him ere we were two days old
 at sea a pirate of very warlike appointment gave us
 chase finding ourselves too slow of sail we put on
 a compelled valour and in the grapple i boarded
 them on the instant they got clear of our ship so
 i alone became their prisoner they have dealt with
 me like thieves of mercy but they knew what they
 did i am to do a good turn for them let the king
 have the letters i have sent and repair thou to me
 with as much speed as thou wouldst fly death i
 have words to speak in thine ear will make thee
 dumb yet are they much too light for the bore of
 the matter these good fellows will bring thee
 where i am rosencrantz and guildenstern hold their
 course for england of them i have much to tell
 thee farewell
 he that thou knowest thine hamlet'
 come i will make you way for these your letters
 and do't the speedier that you may direct me
 to him from whom you brought them
 exeunt
 hamlet
act iv
scene vii another room in the castle
 enter king claudius and laertes
king claudius now must your conscience my acquaintance seal
 and you must put me in your heart for friend
 sith you have heard and with a knowing ear
 that he which hath your noble father slain
 pursued my life
laertes it well appears but tell me
 why you proceeded not against these feats
 so crimeful and so capital in nature
 as by your safety wisdom all things else
 you mainly were stirr'd up
king claudius o for two special reasons
 which may to you perhaps seem much unsinew'd
 but yet to me they are strong the queen his mother
 lives almost by his looks and for myself
 my virtue or my plague be it either which
 she's so conjunctive to my life and soul
 that as the star moves not but in his sphere
 i could not but by her the other motive
 why to a public count i might not go
 is the great love the general gender bear him
 who dipping all his faults in their affection
 would like the spring that turneth wood to stone
 convert his gyves to graces so that my arrows
 too slightly timber'd for so loud a wind
 would have reverted to my bow again
 and not where i had aim'd them
laertes and so have i a noble father lost
 a sister driven into desperate terms
 whose worth if praises may go back again
 stood challenger on mount of all the age
 for her perfections but my revenge will come
king claudius break not your sleeps for that you must not think
 that we are made of stuff so flat and dull
 that we can let our beard be shook with danger
 and think it pastime you shortly shall hear more
 i loved your father and we love ourself
 and that i hope will teach you to imagine
 enter a messenger
 how now what news
messenger letters my lord from hamlet
 this to your majesty this to the queen
king claudius from hamlet who brought them
messenger sailors my lord they say i saw them not
 they were given me by claudio he received them
 of him that brought them
king claudius laertes you shall hear them leave us
 exit messenger
 reads
 high and mighty you shall know i am set naked on
 your kingdom tomorrow shall i beg leave to see
 your kingly eyes when i shall first asking your
 pardon thereunto recount the occasion of my sudden
 and more strange return hamlet'
 what should this mean are all the rest come back
 or is it some abuse and no such thing
laertes know you the hand
king claudius tis hamlets character naked
 and in a postscript here he says alone'
 can you advise me
laertes i'm lost in it my lord but let him come
 it warms the very sickness in my heart
 that i shall live and tell him to his teeth
 thus didest thou'
king claudius if it be so laertes
 as how should it be so how otherwise
 will you be ruled by me
laertes ay my lord
 so you will not o'errule me to a peace
king claudius to thine own peace if he be now return'd
 as checking at his voyage and that he means
 no more to undertake it i will work him
 to an exploit now ripe in my device
 under the which he shall not choose but fall
 and for his death no wind of blame shall breathe
 but even his mother shall uncharge the practise
 and call it accident
laertes my lord i will be ruled
 the rather if you could devise it so
 that i might be the organ
king claudius it falls right
 you have been talk'd of since your travel much
 and that in hamlet's hearing for a quality
 wherein they say you shine your sum of parts
 did not together pluck such envy from him
 as did that one and that in my regard
 of the unworthiest siege
laertes what part is that my lord
king claudius a very riband in the cap of youth
 yet needful too for youth no less becomes
 the light and careless livery that it wears
 than settled age his sables and his weeds
 importing health and graveness two months since
 here was a gentleman of normandy
 i've seen myself and served against the french
 and they can well on horseback but this gallant
 had witchcraft in't he grew unto his seat
 and to such wondrous doing brought his horse
 as he had been incorpsed and deminatured
 with the brave beast so far he topp'd my thought
 that i in forgery of shapes and tricks
 come short of what he did
laertes a norman was't
king claudius a norman
