why trimmest thou thy way to seek love therefore hast thou also taught the wicked ones thy ways
also in thy skirts is found the blood of the souls of the poor innocents i have not found it by secret search but upon all these
yet thou sayest because i am innocent surely his anger shall turn from me behold i will plead with thee because thou sayest i have not sinned
why gaddest thou about so much to change thy way thou also shalt be ashamed of egypt as thou wast ashamed of assyria
yea thou shalt go forth from him and thine hands upon thine head for the lord hath rejected thy confidences and thou shalt not prosper in them
they say if a man put away his wife and she go from him and become another man's shall he return unto her again shall not that land be greatly polluted but thou hast played the harlot with many lovers yet return again to me saith the lord
lift up thine eyes unto the high places and see where thou hast not been lien with in the ways hast thou sat for them as the arabian in the wilderness and thou hast polluted the land with thy whoredoms and with thy wickedness
therefore the showers have been withholden and there hath been no latter rain and thou hadst a whore's forehead thou refusedst to be ashamed
wilt thou not from this time cry unto me my father thou art the guide of my youth
will he reserve his anger for ever will he keep it to the end behold thou hast spoken and done evil things as thou couldest
the lord said also unto me in the days of josiah the king hast thou seen that which backsliding israel hath done she is gone up upon every high mountain and under every green tree and there hath played the harlot
and i said after she had done all these things turn thou unto me but she returned not and her treacherous sister judah saw it
and i saw when for all the causes whereby backsliding israel committed adultery i had put her away and given her a bill of divorce yet her treacherous sister judah feared not but went and played the harlot also
and it came to pass through the lightness of her whoredom that she defiled the land and committed adultery with stones and with stocks
and yet for all this her treacherous sister judah hath not turned unto me with her whole heart but feignedly saith the lord
and the lord said unto me the backsliding israel hath justified herself more than treacherous judah
go and proclaim these words toward the north and say return thou backsliding israel saith the lord and i will not cause mine anger to fall upon you for i am merciful saith the lord and i will not keep anger for ever
only acknowledge thine iniquity that thou hast transgressed against the lord thy god and hast scattered thy ways to the strangers under every green tree and ye have not obeyed my voice saith the lord
turn o backsliding children saith the lord for i am married unto you and i will take you one of a city and two of a family and i will bring you to zion
and i will give you pastors according to mine heart which shall feed you with knowledge and understanding
and it shall come to pass when ye be multiplied and increased in the land in those days saith the lord they shall say no more the ark of the covenant of the lord neither shall it come to mind neither shall they remember it neither shall they visit it neither shall that be done any more
at that time they shall call jerusalem the throne of the lord and all the nations shall be gathered unto it to the name of the lord to jerusalem neither shall they walk any more after the imagination of their evil heart
in those days the house of judah shall walk with the house of israel and they shall come together out of the land of the north to the land that i have given for an inheritance unto your fathers
but i said how shall i put thee among the children and give thee a pleasant land a goodly heritage of the hosts of nations and i said thou shalt call me my father and shalt not turn away from me
surely as a wife treacherously departeth from her husband so have ye dealt treacherously with me o house of israel saith the lord
a voice was heard upon the high places weeping and supplications of the children of israel for they have perverted their way and they have forgotten the lord their god
return ye backsliding children and i will heal your backslidings behold we come unto thee for thou art the lord our god
truly in vain is salvation hoped for from the hills and from the multitude of mountains truly in the lord our god is the salvation of israel
for shame hath devoured the labour of our fathers from our youth their flocks and their herds their sons and their daughters
we lie down in our shame and our confusion covereth us for we have sinned against the lord our god we and our fathers from our youth even unto this day and have not obeyed the voice of the lord our god
if thou wilt return o israel saith the lord return unto me and if thou wilt put away thine abominations out of my sight then shalt thou not remove
and thou shalt swear the lord liveth in truth in judgment and in righteousness and the nations shall bless themselves in him and in him shall they glory
for thus saith the lord to the men of judah and jerusalem break up your fallow ground and sow not among thorns
circumcise yourselves to the lord and take away the foreskins of your heart ye men of judah and inhabitants of jerusalem lest my fury come forth like fire and burn that none can quench it because of the evil of your doings
declare ye in judah and publish in jerusalem and say blow ye the trumpet in the land cry gather together and say assemble yourselves and let us go into the defenced cities
set up the standard toward zion retire stay not for i will bring evil from the north and a great destruction
the lion is come up from his thicket and the destroyer of the gentiles is on his way he is gone forth from his place to make thy land desolate and thy cities shall be laid waste without an inhabitant
for this gird you with sackcloth lament and howl for the fierce anger of the lord is not turned back from us
and it shall come to pass at that day saith the lord that the heart of the king shall perish and the heart of the princes and the priests shall be astonished and the prophets shall wonder
then said i ah lord god surely thou hast greatly deceived this people and jerusalem saying ye shall have peace whereas the sword reacheth unto the soul
at that time shall it be said to this people and to jerusalem a dry wind of the high places in the wilderness toward the daughter of my people not to fan nor to cleanse
even a full wind from those places shall come unto me now also will i give sentence against them
behold he shall come up as clouds and his chariots shall be as a whirlwind his horses are swifter than eagles woe unto us for we are spoiled
o jerusalem wash thine heart from wickedness that thou mayest be saved how long shall thy vain thoughts lodge within thee
for a voice declareth from dan and publisheth affliction from mount ephraim
make ye mention to the nations behold publish against jerusalem that watchers come from a far country and give out their voice against the cities of judah
as keepers of a field are they against her round about because she hath been rebellious against me saith the lord
thy way and thy doings have procured these things unto thee this is thy wickedness because it is bitter because it reacheth unto thine heart
my bowels my bowels i am pained at my very heart my heart maketh a noise in me i cannot hold my peace because thou hast heard o my soul the sound of the trumpet the alarm of war
destruction upon destruction is cried for the whole land is spoiled suddenly are my tents spoiled and my curtains in a moment
how long shall i see the standard and hear the sound of the trumpet
for my people is foolish they have not known me they are sottish children and they have none understanding they are wise to do evil but to do good they have no knowledge
i beheld the earth and lo it was without form and void and the heavens and they had no light
i beheld the mountains and lo they trembled and all the hills moved lightly
i beheld and lo there was no man and all the birds of the heavens were fled
i beheld and lo the fruitful place was a wilderness and all the cities thereof were broken down at the presence of the lord and by his fierce anger
for thus hath the lord said the whole land shall be desolate yet will i not make a full end
for this shall the earth mourn and the heavens above be black because i have spoken it i have purposed it and will not repent neither will i turn back from it
the whole city shall flee for the noise of the horsemen and bowmen they shall go into thickets and climb up upon the rocks every city shall be forsaken and not a man dwell therein
and when thou art spoiled what wilt thou do though thou clothest thyself with crimson though thou deckest thee with ornaments of gold though thou rentest thy face with painting in vain shalt thou make thyself fair thy lovers will despise thee they will seek thy life
for i have heard a voice as of a woman in travail and the anguish as of her that bringeth forth her first child the voice of the daughter of zion that bewaileth herself that spreadeth her hands saying woe is me now for my soul is wearied because of murderers
run ye to and fro through the streets of jerusalem and see now and know and seek in the broad places thereof if ye can find a man if there be any that executeth judgment that seeketh the truth and i will pardon it
and though they say the lord liveth surely they swear falsely
o lord are not thine eyes upon the truth thou hast stricken them but they have not grieved thou hast consumed them but they have refused to receive correction they have made their faces harder than a rock they have refused to return
therefore i said surely these are poor they are foolish for they know not the way of the lord nor the judgment of their god
i will get me unto the great men and will speak unto them for they have known the way of the lord and the judgment of their god but these have altogether broken the yoke and burst the bonds
wherefore a lion out of the forest shall slay them and a wolf of the evenings shall spoil them a leopard shall watch over their cities every one that goeth out thence shall be torn in pieces because their transgressions are many and their backslidings are increased
how shall i pardon thee for this thy children have forsaken me and sworn by them that are no gods when i had fed them to the full they then committed adultery and assembled themselves by troops in the harlots houses
they were as fed horses in the morning every one neighed after his neighbour's wife
shall i not visit for these things saith the lord and shall not my soul be avenged on such a nation as this
go ye up upon her walls and destroy but make not a full end take away her battlements for they are not the lord's
for the house of israel and the house of judah have dealt very treacherously against me saith the lord
they have belied the lord and said it is not he neither shall evil come upon us neither shall we see sword nor famine
and the prophets shall become wind and the word is not in them thus shall it be done unto them
wherefore thus saith the lord god of hosts because ye speak this word behold i will make my words in thy mouth fire and this people wood and it shall devour them
lo i will bring a nation upon you from far o house of israel saith the lord it is a mighty nation it is an ancient nation a nation whose language thou knowest not neither understandest what they say
their quiver is as an open sepulchre they are all mighty men
and they shall eat up thine harvest and thy bread which thy sons and thy daughters should eat they shall eat up thy flocks and thine herds they shall eat up thy vines and thy fig trees they shall impoverish thy fenced cities wherein thou trustedst with the sword
nevertheless in those days saith the lord i will not make a full end with you
and it shall come to pass when ye shall say wherefore doeth the lord our god all these things unto us then shalt thou answer them like as ye have forsaken me and served strange gods in your land so shall ye serve strangers in a land that is not yours
declare this in the house of jacob and publish it in judah saying
hear now this o foolish people and without understanding which have eyes and see not which have ears and hear not
fear ye not me saith the lord will ye not tremble at my presence which have placed the sand for the bound of the sea by a perpetual decree that it cannot pass it and though the waves thereof toss themselves yet can they not prevail though they roar yet can they not pass over it
but this people hath a revolting and a rebellious heart they are revolted and gone
neither say they in their heart let us now fear the lord our god that giveth rain both the former and the latter in his season he reserveth unto us the appointed weeks of the harvest
your iniquities have turned away these things and your sins have withholden good things from you
for among my people are found wicked men they lay wait as he that setteth snares they set a trap they catch men
as a cage is full of birds so are their houses full of deceit therefore they are become great and waxen rich
they are waxen fat they shine yea they overpass the deeds of the wicked they judge not the cause the cause of the fatherless yet they prosper and the right of the needy do they not judge
shall i not visit for these things saith the lord shall not my soul be avenged on such a nation as this
a wonderful and horrible thing is committed in the land
the prophets prophesy falsely and the priests bear rule by their means and my people love to have it so and what will ye do in the end thereof
o ye children of benjamin gather yourselves to flee out of the midst of jerusalem and blow the trumpet in tekoa and set up a sign of fire in bethhaccerem for evil appeareth out of the north and great destruction
i have likened the daughter of zion to a comely and delicate woman
the shepherds with their flocks shall come unto her they shall pitch their tents against her round about they shall feed every one in his place
prepare ye war against her arise and let us go up at noon woe unto us for the day goeth away for the shadows of the evening are stretched out
arise and let us go by night and let us destroy her palaces
for thus hath the lord of hosts said hew ye down trees and cast a mount against jerusalem this is the city to be visited she is wholly oppression in the midst of her
as a fountain casteth out her waters so she casteth out her wickedness violence and spoil is heard in her before me continually is grief and wounds
be thou instructed o jerusalem lest my soul depart from thee lest i make thee desolate a land not inhabited
thus saith the lord of hosts they shall throughly glean the remnant of israel as a vine turn back thine hand as a grapegatherer into the baskets
to whom shall i speak and give warning that they may hear behold their ear is uncircumcised and they cannot hearken behold the word of the lord is unto them a reproach they have no delight in it
therefore i am full of the fury of the lord i am weary with holding in i will pour it out upon the children abroad and upon the assembly of young men together for even the husband with the wife shall be taken the aged with him that is full of days
and their houses shall be turned unto others with their fields and wives together for i will stretch out my hand upon the inhabitants of the land saith the lord
for from the least of them even unto the greatest of them every one is given to covetousness and from the prophet even unto the priest every one dealeth falsely
they have healed also the hurt of the daughter of my people slightly saying peace peace when there is no peace
were they ashamed when they had committed abomination nay they were not at all ashamed neither could they blush therefore they shall fall among them that fall at the time that i visit them they shall be cast down saith the lord
thus saith the lord stand ye in the ways and see and ask for the old paths where is the good way and walk therein and ye shall find rest for your souls but they said we will not walk therein
also i set watchmen over you saying hearken to the sound of the trumpet but they said we will not hearken
therefore hear ye nations and know o congregation what is among them
hear o earth behold i will bring evil upon this people even the fruit of their thoughts because they have not hearkened unto my words nor to my law but rejected it
to what purpose cometh there to me incense from sheba and the sweet cane from a far country your burnt offerings are not acceptable nor your sacrifices sweet unto me
therefore thus saith the lord behold i will lay stumblingblocks before this people and the fathers and the sons together shall fall upon them the neighbour and his friend shall perish
thus saith the lord behold a people cometh from the north country and a great nation shall be raised from the sides of the earth
they shall lay hold on bow and spear they are cruel and have no mercy their voice roareth like the sea and they ride upon horses set in array as men for war against thee o daughter of zion
we have heard the fame thereof our hands wax feeble anguish hath taken hold of us and pain as of a woman in travail
go not forth into the field nor walk by the way for the sword of the enemy and fear is on every side
o daughter of my people gird thee with sackcloth and wallow thyself in ashes make thee mourning as for an only son most bitter lamentation for the spoiler shall suddenly come upon us
i have set thee for a tower and a fortress among my people that thou mayest know and try their way
they are all grievous revolters walking with slanders they are brass and iron they are all corrupters
the bellows are burned the lead is consumed of the fire the founder melteth in vain for the wicked are not plucked away
reprobate silver shall men call them because the lord hath rejected them
the word that came to jeremiah from the lord saying
stand in the gate of the lord's house and proclaim there this word and say hear the word of the lord all ye of judah that enter in at these gates to worship the lord
thus saith the lord of hosts the god of israel amend your ways and your doings and i will cause you to dwell in this place
trust ye not in lying words saying the temple of the lord the temple of the lord the temple of the lord are these
for if ye throughly amend your ways and your doings if ye throughly execute judgment between a man and his neighbour
if ye oppress not the stranger the fatherless and the widow and shed not innocent blood in this place neither walk after other gods to your hurt
then will i cause you to dwell in this place in the land that i gave to your fathers for ever and ever
behold ye trust in lying words that cannot profit
will ye steal murder and commit adultery and swear falsely and burn incense unto baal and walk after other gods whom ye know not
and come and stand before me in this house which is called by my name and say we are delivered to do all these abominations
is this house which is called by my name become a den of robbers in your eyes behold even i have seen it saith the lord
but go ye now unto my place which was in shiloh where i set my name at the first and see what i did to it for the wickedness of my people israel
and now because ye have done all these works saith the lord and i spake unto you rising up early and speaking but ye heard not and i called you but ye answered not
therefore will i do unto this house which is called by my name wherein ye trust and unto the place which i gave to you and to your fathers as i have done to shiloh
and i will cast you out of my sight as i have cast out all your brethren even the whole seed of ephraim
therefore pray not thou for this people neither lift up cry nor prayer for them neither make intercession to me for i will not hear thee
seest thou not what they do in the cities of judah and in the streets of jerusalem
the children gather wood and the fathers kindle the fire and the women knead their dough to make cakes to the queen of heaven and to pour out drink offerings unto other gods that they may provoke me to anger
do they provoke me to anger saith the lord do they not provoke themselves to the confusion of their own faces
therefore thus saith the lord god behold mine anger and my fury shall be poured out upon this place upon man and upon beast and upon the trees of the field and upon the fruit of the ground and it shall burn and shall not be quenched
thus saith the lord of hosts the god of israel put your burnt offerings unto your sacrifices and eat flesh
for i spake not unto your fathers nor commanded them in the day that i brought them out of the land of egypt concerning burnt offerings or sacrifices
but this thing commanded i them saying obey my voice and i will be your god and ye shall be my people and walk ye in all the ways that i have commanded you that it may be well unto you
but they hearkened not nor inclined their ear but walked in the counsels and in the imagination of their evil heart and went backward and not forward
since the day that your fathers came forth out of the land of egypt unto this day i have even sent unto you all my servants the prophets daily rising up early and sending them
yet they hearkened not unto me nor inclined their ear but hardened their neck they did worse than their fathers
therefore thou shalt speak all these words unto them but they will not hearken to thee thou shalt also call unto them but they will not answer thee
but thou shalt say unto them this is a nation that obeyeth not the voice of the lord their god nor receiveth correction truth is perished and is cut off from their mouth
cut off thine hair o jerusalem and cast it away and take up a lamentation on high places for the lord hath rejected and forsaken the generation of his wrath
for the children of judah have done evil in my sight saith the lord they have set their abominations in the house which is called by my name to pollute it
and they have built the high places of tophet which is in the valley of the son of hinnom to burn their sons and their daughters in the fire which i commanded them not neither came it into my heart
therefore behold the days come saith the lord that it shall no more be called tophet nor the valley of the son of hinnom but the valley of slaughter for they shall bury in tophet till there be no place
and the carcases of this people shall be meat for the fowls of the heaven and for the beasts of the earth and none shall fray them away
then will i cause to cease from the cities of judah and from the streets of jerusalem the voice of mirth and the voice of gladness the voice of the bridegroom and the voice of the bride for the land shall be desolate
at that time saith the lord they shall bring out the bones of the kings of judah and the bones of his princes and the bones of the priests and the bones of the prophets and the bones of the inhabitants of jerusalem out of their graves
and they shall spread them before the sun and the moon and all the host of heaven whom they have loved and whom they have served and after whom they have walked and whom they have sought and whom they have worshipped they shall not be gathered nor be buried they shall be for dung upon the face of the earth
and death shall be chosen rather than life by all the residue of them that remain of this evil family which remain in all the places whither i have driven them saith the lord of hosts
moreover thou shalt say unto them thus saith the lord shall they fall and not arise shall he turn away and not return
why then is this people of jerusalem slidden back by a perpetual backsliding they hold fast deceit they refuse to return
i hearkened and heard but they spake not aright no man repented him of his wickedness saying what have i done every one turned to his course as the horse rusheth into the battle
yea the stork in the heaven knoweth her appointed times and the turtle and the crane and the swallow observe the time of their coming but my people know not the judgment of the lord
how do ye say we are wise and the law of the lord is with us lo certainly in vain made he it the pen of the scribes is in vain
the wise men are ashamed they are dismayed and taken lo they have rejected the word of the lord and what wisdom is in them
therefore will i give their wives unto others and their fields to them that shall inherit them for every one from the least even unto the greatest is given to covetousness from the prophet even unto the priest every one dealeth falsely
for they have healed the hurt of the daughter of my people slightly saying peace peace when there is no peace
were they ashamed when they had committed abomination nay they were not at all ashamed neither could they blush therefore shall they fall among them that fall in the time of their visitation they shall be cast down saith the lord
i will surely consume them saith the lord there shall be no grapes on the vine nor figs on the fig tree and the leaf shall fade and the things that i have given them shall pass away from them
why do we sit still assemble yourselves and let us enter into the defenced cities and let us be silent there for the lord our god hath put us to silence and given us water of gall to drink because we have sinned against the lord
we looked for peace but no good came and for a time of health and behold trouble
the snorting of his horses was heard from dan the whole land trembled at the sound of the neighing of his strong ones for they are come and have devoured the land and all that is in it the city and those that dwell therein
for behold i will send serpents cockatrices among you which will not be charmed and they shall bite you saith the lord
when i would comfort myself against sorrow my heart is faint in me
behold the voice of the cry of the daughter of my people because of them that dwell in a far country is not the lord in zion is not her king in her why have they provoked me to anger with their graven images and with strange vanities
the harvest is past the summer is ended and we are not saved
for the hurt of the daughter of my people am i hurt i am black astonishment hath taken hold on me
is there no balm in gilead is there no physician there why then is not the health of the daughter of my people recovered
oh that my head were waters and mine eyes a fountain of tears that i might weep day and night for the slain of the daughter of my people
oh that i had in the wilderness a lodging place of wayfaring men that i might leave my people and go from them for they be all adulterers an assembly of treacherous men
and they bend their tongues like their bow for lies but they are not valiant for the truth upon the earth for they proceed from evil to evil and they know not me saith the lord
take ye heed every one of his neighbour and trust ye not in any brother for every brother will utterly supplant and every neighbour will walk with slanders
and they will deceive every one his neighbour and will not speak the truth they have taught their tongue to speak lies and weary themselves to commit iniquity
thine habitation is in the midst of deceit through deceit they refuse to know me saith the lord
therefore thus saith the lord of hosts behold i will melt them and try them for how shall i do for the daughter of my people
their tongue is as an arrow shot out it speaketh deceit one speaketh peaceably to his neighbour with his mouth but in heart he layeth his wait
shall i not visit them for these things saith the lord shall not my soul be avenged on such a nation as this
for the mountains will i take up a weeping and wailing and for the habitations of the wilderness a lamentation because they are burned up so that none can pass through them neither can men hear the voice of the cattle both the fowl of the heavens and the beast are fled they are gone
and i will make jerusalem heaps and a den of dragons and i will make the cities of judah desolate without an inhabitant
who is the wise man that may understand this and who is he to whom the mouth of the lord hath spoken that he may declare it for what the land perisheth and is burned up like a wilderness that none passeth through
and the lord saith because they have forsaken my law which i set before them and have not obeyed my voice neither walked therein
but have walked after the imagination of their own heart and after baalim which their fathers taught them
therefore thus saith the lord of hosts the god of israel behold i will feed them even this people with wormwood and give them water of gall to drink
i will scatter them also among the heathen whom neither they nor their fathers have known and i will send a sword after them till i have consumed them
thus saith the lord of hosts consider ye and call for the mourning women that they may come and send for cunning women that they may come
and let them make haste and take up a wailing for us that our eyes may run down with tears and our eyelids gush out with waters
for a voice of wailing is heard out of zion how are we spoiled we are greatly confounded because we have forsaken the land because our dwellings have cast us out
yet hear the word of the lord o ye women and let your ear receive the word of his mouth and teach your daughters wailing and every one her neighbour lamentation
for death is come up into our windows and is entered into our palaces to cut off the children from without and the young men from the streets
speak thus saith the lord even the carcases of men shall fall as dung upon the open field and as the handful after the harvestman and none shall gather them
