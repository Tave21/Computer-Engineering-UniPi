 ere he express himself or move the people
 with what he would say let him feel your sword
 which we will second when he lies along
 after your way his tale pronounced shall bury
 his reasons with his body
aufidius say no more
 here come the lords
 enter the lords of the city
all the lords you are most welcome home
aufidius i have not deserved it
 but worthy lords have you with heed perused
 what i have written to you
lords we have
first lord and grieve to hear't
 what faults he made before the last i think
 might have found easy fines but there to end
 where he was to begin and give away
 the benefit of our levies answering us
 with our own charge making a treaty where
 there was a yieldingthis admits no excuse
aufidius he approaches you shall hear him
 enter coriolanus marching with drum and
 colours commoners being with him
coriolanus hail lords i am return'd your soldier
 no more infected with my country's love
 than when i parted hence but still subsisting
 under your great command you are to know
 that prosperously i have attempted and
 with bloody passage led your wars even to
 the gates of rome our spoils we have brought home
 do more than counterpoise a full third part
 the charges of the action we have made peace
 with no less honour to the antiates
 than shame to the romans and we here deliver
 subscribed by the consuls and patricians
 together with the seal o the senate what
 we have compounded on
aufidius read it not noble lords
 but tell the traitor in the high'st degree
 he hath abused your powers
coriolanus traitor how now
aufidius ay traitor marcius
coriolanus marcius
aufidius ay marcius caius marcius dost thou think
 i'll grace thee with that robbery thy stol'n name
 coriolanus in corioli
 you lords and heads o the state perfidiously
 he has betray'd your business and given up
 for certain drops of salt your city rome
 i say your city to his wife and mother
 breaking his oath and resolution like
 a twist of rotten silk never admitting
 counsel o the war but at his nurse's tears
 he whined and roar'd away your victory
 that pages blush'd at him and men of heart
 look'd wondering each at other
coriolanus hear'st thou mars
aufidius name not the god thou boy of tears
coriolanus ha
aufidius no more
coriolanus measureless liar thou hast made my heart
 too great for what contains it boy o slave
 pardon me lords tis the first time that ever
 i was forced to scold your judgments my grave lords
 must give this cur the lie and his own notion
 who wears my stripes impress'd upon him that
 must bear my beating to his graveshall join
 to thrust the lie unto him
first lord peace both and hear me speak
coriolanus cut me to pieces volsces men and lads
 stain all your edges on me boy false hound
 if you have writ your annals true tis there
 that like an eagle in a dovecote i
 flutter'd your volscians in corioli
 alone i did it boy
aufidius why noble lords
 will you be put in mind of his blind fortune
 which was your shame by this unholy braggart
 fore your own eyes and ears
all conspirators let him die for't
all the people tear him to pieces do it presently he kill'd
 my son my daughter he killed my cousin
 marcus he killed my father'
second lord peace ho no outrage peace
 the man is noble and his fame foldsin
 this orb o the earth his last offences to us
 shall have judicious hearing stand aufidius
 and trouble not the peace
coriolanus o that i had him
 with six aufidiuses or more his tribe
 to use my lawful sword
aufidius insolent villain
all conspirators kill kill kill kill kill him
 the conspirators draw and kill coriolanus
 aufidius stands on his body
lords hold hold hold hold
aufidius my noble masters hear me speak
first lord o tullus
second lord thou hast done a deed whereat valour will weep
third lord tread not upon him masters all be quiet
 put up your swords
aufidius my lords when you shall knowas in this rage
 provoked by him you cannotthe great danger
 which this man's life did owe you you'll rejoice
 that he is thus cut off please it your honours
 to call me to your senate i'll deliver
 myself your loyal servant or endure
 your heaviest censure
first lord bear from hence his body
 and mourn you for him let him be regarded
 as the most noble corse that ever herald
 did follow to his urn
second lord his own impatience
 takes from aufidius a great part of blame
 let's make the best of it
aufidius my rage is gone
 and i am struck with sorrow take him up
 help three o the chiefest soldiers i'll be one
 beat thou the drum that it speak mournfully
 trail your steel pikes though in this city he
 hath widow'd and unchilded many a one
 which to this hour bewail the injury
 yet he shall have a noble memory assist
 exeunt bearing the body of coriolanus a dead
 march sounded
