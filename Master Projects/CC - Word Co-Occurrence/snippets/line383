duke senior most mischievous foul sin in chiding sin
 for thou thyself hast been a libertine
 as sensual as the brutish sting itself
 and all the embossed sores and headed evils
 that thou with licence of free foot hast caught
 wouldst thou disgorge into the general world
jaques why who cries out on pride
 that can therein tax any private party
 doth it not flow as hugely as the sea
 till that the weary very means do ebb
 what woman in the city do i name
 when that i say the citywoman bears
 the cost of princes on unworthy shoulders
 who can come in and say that i mean her
 when such a one as she such is her neighbour
 or what is he of basest function
 that says his bravery is not of my cost
 thinking that i mean him but therein suits
 his folly to the mettle of my speech
 there then how then what then let me see wherein
 my tongue hath wrong'd him if it do him right
 then he hath wrong'd himself if he be free
 why then my taxing like a wildgoose flies
 unclaim'd of any man but who comes here
 enter orlando with his sword drawn
orlando forbear and eat no more
jaques why i have eat none yet
orlando nor shalt not till necessity be served
jaques of what kind should this cock come of
duke senior art thou thus bolden'd man by thy distress
 or else a rude despiser of good manners
 that in civility thou seem'st so empty
orlando you touch'd my vein at first the thorny point
 of bare distress hath ta'en from me the show
 of smooth civility yet am i inland bred
 and know some nurture but forbear i say
 he dies that touches any of this fruit
 till i and my affairs are answered
jaques an you will not be answered with reason i must die
duke senior what would you have your gentleness shall force
 more than your force move us to gentleness
orlando i almost die for food and let me have it
duke senior sit down and feed and welcome to our table
orlando speak you so gently pardon me i pray you
 i thought that all things had been savage here
 and therefore put i on the countenance
 of stern commandment but whate'er you are
 that in this desert inaccessible
 under the shade of melancholy boughs
 lose and neglect the creeping hours of time
 if ever you have look'd on better days
 if ever been where bells have knoll'd to church
 if ever sat at any good man's feast
 if ever from your eyelids wiped a tear
 and know what tis to pity and be pitied
 let gentleness my strong enforcement be
 in the which hope i blush and hide my sword
duke senior true is it that we have seen better days
 and have with holy bell been knoll'd to church
 and sat at good men's feasts and wiped our eyes
 of drops that sacred pity hath engender'd
 and therefore sit you down in gentleness
 and take upon command what help we have
 that to your wanting may be minister'd
orlando then but forbear your food a little while
 whiles like a doe i go to find my fawn
 and give it food there is an old poor man
 who after me hath many a weary step
 limp'd in pure love till he be first sufficed
 oppress'd with two weak evils age and hunger
 i will not touch a bit
duke senior go find him out
 and we will nothing waste till you return
orlando i thank ye and be blest for your good comfort
 exit
duke senior thou seest we are not all alone unhappy
 this wide and universal theatre
 presents more woeful pageants than the scene
 wherein we play in
jaques all the world's a stage
 and all the men and women merely players
 they have their exits and their entrances
 and one man in his time plays many parts
 his acts being seven ages at first the infant
 mewling and puking in the nurse's arms
 and then the whining schoolboy with his satchel
 and shining morning face creeping like snail
 unwillingly to school and then the lover
 sighing like furnace with a woeful ballad
 made to his mistress eyebrow then a soldier
 full of strange oaths and bearded like the pard
 jealous in honour sudden and quick in quarrel
 seeking the bubble reputation
 even in the cannon's mouth and then the justice
 in fair round belly with good capon lined
 with eyes severe and beard of formal cut
 full of wise saws and modern instances
 and so he plays his part the sixth age shifts
 into the lean and slipper'd pantaloon
 with spectacles on nose and pouch on side
 his youthful hose well saved a world too wide
 for his shrunk shank and his big manly voice
 turning again toward childish treble pipes
 and whistles in his sound last scene of all
 that ends this strange eventful history
 is second childishness and mere oblivion
 sans teeth sans eyes sans taste sans everything
 reenter orlando with adam
duke senior welcome set down your venerable burthen
 and let him feed
orlando i thank you most for him
adam so had you need
 i scarce can speak to thank you for myself
duke senior welcome fall to i will not trouble you
 as yet to question you about your fortunes
 give us some music and good cousin sing
 
 song
amiens blow blow thou winter wind
 thou art not so unkind
 as man's ingratitude
 thy tooth is not so keen
 because thou art not seen
 although thy breath be rude
 heighho sing heighho unto the green holly
 most friendship is feigning most loving mere folly
 then heighho the holly
 this life is most jolly
 freeze freeze thou bitter sky
 that dost not bite so nigh
 as benefits forgot
 though thou the waters warp
 thy sting is not so sharp
 as friend remember'd not
 heighho sing &c
duke senior if that you were the good sir rowland's son
 as you have whisper'd faithfully you were
 and as mine eye doth his effigies witness
 most truly limn'd and living in your face
 be truly welcome hither i am the duke
 that loved your father the residue of your fortune
 go to my cave and tell me good old man
 thou art right welcome as thy master is
 support him by the arm give me your hand
 and let me all your fortunes understand
 exeunt
 as you like it
act iii
scene i a room in the palace
 enter duke frederick lords and oliver
duke frederick not see him since sir sir that cannot be
 but were i not the better part made mercy
 i should not seek an absent argument
 of my revenge thou present but look to it
 find out thy brother wheresoe'er he is
 seek him with candle bring him dead or living
 within this twelvemonth or turn thou no more
 to seek a living in our territory
 thy lands and all things that thou dost call thine
 worth seizure do we seize into our hands
 till thou canst quit thee by thy brothers mouth
 of what we think against thee
oliver o that your highness knew my heart in this
 i never loved my brother in my life
duke frederick more villain thou well push him out of doors
 and let my officers of such a nature
 make an extent upon his house and lands
 do this expediently and turn him going
 exeunt
 as you like it
act iii
scene ii the forest
 enter orlando with a paper
orlando hang there my verse in witness of my love
 and thou thricecrowned queen of night survey
 with thy chaste eye from thy pale sphere above
 thy huntress name that my full life doth sway
 o rosalind these trees shall be my books
 and in their barks my thoughts i'll character
 that every eye which in this forest looks
 shall see thy virtue witness'd every where
 run run orlando carve on every tree
 the fair the chaste and unexpressive she
 exit
 enter corin and touchstone
corin and how like you this shepherd's life master touchstone
touchstone truly shepherd in respect of itself it is a good
 life but in respect that it is a shepherd's life
 it is naught in respect that it is solitary i
 like it very well but in respect that it is
 private it is a very vile life now in respect it
 is in the fields it pleaseth me well but in
 respect it is not in the court it is tedious as
 is it a spare life look you it fits my humour well
 but as there is no more plenty in it it goes much
 against my stomach hast any philosophy in thee shepherd
corin no more but that i know the more one sickens the
 worse at ease he is and that he that wants money
 means and content is without three good friends
 that the property of rain is to wet and fire to
