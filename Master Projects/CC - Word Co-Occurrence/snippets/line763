 thou dost confirm his happiness for ever
lady anne what is it
gloucester that it would please thee leave these sad designs
 to him that hath more cause to be a mourner
 and presently repair to crosby place
 where after i have solemnly interr'd
 at chertsey monastery this noble king
 and wet his grave with my repentant tears
 i will with all expedient duty see you
 for divers unknown reasons i beseech you
 grant me this boon
lady anne with all my heart and much it joys me too
 to see you are become so penitent
 tressel and berkeley go along with me
gloucester bid me farewell
lady anne tis more than you deserve
 but since you teach me how to flatter you
 imagine i have said farewell already
 exeunt lady anne tressel and berkeley
gloucester sirs take up the corse
gentlemen towards chertsey noble lord
gloucester no to whitefriars there attend my coining
 exeunt all but gloucester
 was ever woman in this humour woo'd
 was ever woman in this humour won
 i'll have her but i will not keep her long
 what i that kill'd her husband and his father
 to take her in her heart's extremest hate
 with curses in her mouth tears in her eyes
 the bleeding witness of her hatred by
 having god her conscience and these bars
 against me
 and i nothing to back my suit at all
 but the plain devil and dissembling looks
 and yet to win her all the world to nothing
 ha
 hath she forgot already that brave prince
 edward her lord whom i some three months since
 stabb'd in my angry mood at tewksbury
 a sweeter and a lovelier gentleman
 framed in the prodigality of nature
 young valiant wise and no doubt right royal
 the spacious world cannot again afford
 and will she yet debase her eyes on me
 that cropp'd the golden prime of this sweet prince
 and made her widow to a woful bed
 on me whose all not equals edward's moiety
 on me that halt and am unshapen thus
 my dukedom to a beggarly denier
 i do mistake my person all this while
 upon my life she finds although i cannot
 myself to be a marvellous proper man
 i'll be at charges for a lookingglass
 and entertain some score or two of tailors
 to study fashions to adorn my body
 since i am crept in favour with myself
 will maintain it with some little cost
 but first i'll turn yon fellow in his grave
 and then return lamenting to my love
 shine out fair sun till i have bought a glass
 that i may see my shadow as i pass
 exit
 king richard iii
act i
scene iii the palace
 enter queen elizabeth rivers and grey
rivers have patience madam there's no doubt his majesty
 will soon recover his accustom'd health
grey in that you brook it in it makes him worse
 therefore for god's sake entertain good comfort
 and cheer his grace with quick and merry words
queen elizabeth if he were dead what would betide of me
rivers no other harm but loss of such a lord
queen elizabeth the loss of such a lord includes all harm
grey the heavens have bless'd you with a goodly son
 to be your comforter when he is gone
queen elizabeth oh he is young and his minority
 is put unto the trust of richard gloucester
 a man that loves not me nor none of you
rivers is it concluded that he shall be protector
queen elizabeth it is determined not concluded yet
 but so it must be if the king miscarry
 enter buckingham and derby
grey here come the lords of buckingham and derby
buckingham good time of day unto your royal grace
derby god make your majesty joyful as you have been
queen elizabeth the countess richmond good my lord of derby
 to your good prayers will scarcely say amen
 yet derby notwithstanding she's your wife
 and loves not me be you good lord assured
 i hate not you for her proud arrogance
derby i do beseech you either not believe
 the envious slanders of her false accusers
 or if she be accused in true report
 bear with her weakness which i think proceeds
 from wayward sickness and no grounded malice
rivers saw you the king today my lord of derby
derby but now the duke of buckingham and i
 are come from visiting his majesty
queen elizabeth what likelihood of his amendment lords
buckingham madam good hope his grace speaks cheerfully
queen elizabeth god grant him health did you confer with him
buckingham madam we did he desires to make atonement
 betwixt the duke of gloucester and your brothers
 and betwixt them and my lord chamberlain
 and sent to warn them to his royal presence
queen elizabeth would all were well but that will never be
 i fear our happiness is at the highest
 enter gloucester hastings and dorset
gloucester they do me wrong and i will not endure it
 who are they that complain unto the king
 that i forsooth am stern and love them not
 by holy paul they love his grace but lightly
 that fill his ears with such dissentious rumours
 because i cannot flatter and speak fair
 smile in men's faces smooth deceive and cog
 duck with french nods and apish courtesy
 i must be held a rancorous enemy
 cannot a plain man live and think no harm
 but thus his simple truth must be abused
 by silken sly insinuating jacks
rivers to whom in all this presence speaks your grace
gloucester to thee that hast nor honesty nor grace
 when have i injured thee when done thee wrong
 or thee or thee or any of your faction
 a plague upon you all his royal person
 whom god preserve better than you would wish
 cannot be quiet scarce a breathingwhile
 but you must trouble him with lewd complaints
queen elizabeth brother of gloucester you mistake the matter
 the king of his own royal disposition
 and not provoked by any suitor else
 aiming belike at your interior hatred
 which in your outward actions shows itself
 against my kindred brothers and myself
 makes him to send that thereby he may gather
 the ground of your illwill and so remove it
gloucester i cannot tell the world is grown so bad
 that wrens make prey where eagles dare not perch
 since every jack became a gentleman
 there's many a gentle person made a jack
queen elizabeth come come we know your meaning brother
 gloucester
 you envy my advancement and my friends'
 god grant we never may have need of you
gloucester meantime god grants that we have need of you
 your brother is imprison'd by your means
 myself disgraced and the nobility
 held in contempt whilst many fair promotions
 are daily given to ennoble those
 that scarce some two days since were worth a noble
queen elizabeth by him that raised me to this careful height
 from that contented hap which i enjoy'd
 i never did incense his majesty
 against the duke of clarence but have been
 an earnest advocate to plead for him
 my lord you do me shameful injury
 falsely to draw me in these vile suspects
gloucester you may deny that you were not the cause
 of my lord hastings late imprisonment
rivers she may my lord for
gloucester she may lord rivers why who knows not so
 she may do more sir than denying that
 she may help you to many fair preferments
 and then deny her aiding hand therein
 and lay those honours on your high deserts
 what may she not she may yea marry may she
rivers what marry may she
gloucester what marry may she marry with a king
 a bachelor a handsome stripling too
 i wis your grandam had a worser match
queen elizabeth my lord of gloucester i have too long borne
 your blunt upbraidings and your bitter scoffs
 by heaven i will acquaint his majesty
 with those gross taunts i often have endured
 i had rather be a country servantmaid
 than a great queen with this condition
 to be thus taunted scorn'd and baited at
 enter queen margaret behind
 small joy have i in being england's queen
queen margaret and lessen'd be that small god i beseech thee
 thy honour state and seat is due to me
gloucester what threat you me with telling of the king
 tell him and spare not look what i have said
 i will avouch in presence of the king
 i dare adventure to be sent to the tower
 tis time to speak my pains are quite forgot
queen margaret out devil i remember them too well
 thou slewest my husband henry in the tower
 and edward my poor son at tewksbury
gloucester ere you were queen yea or your husband king
 i was a packhorse in his great affairs
 a weederout of his proud adversaries
 a liberal rewarder of his friends
 to royalize his blood i spilt mine own
queen margaret yea and much better blood than his or thine
gloucester in all which time you and your husband grey
 were factious for the house of lancaster
 and rivers so were you was not your husband
 in margaret's battle at saint alban's slain
