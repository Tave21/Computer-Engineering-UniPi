 by revolution lowering does become
 the opposite of itself she's good being gone
 the hand could pluck her back that shoved her on
 i must from this enchanting queen break off
 ten thousand harms more than the ills i know
 my idleness doth hatch how now enobarbus
 reenter domitius enobarbus
domitius enobarbus what's your pleasure sir
mark antony i must with haste from hence
domitius enobarbus why then we kill all our women
 we see how mortal an unkindness is to them
 if they suffer our departure death's the word
mark antony i must be gone
domitius enobarbus under a compelling occasion let women die it were
 pity to cast them away for nothing though between
 them and a great cause they should be esteemed
 nothing cleopatra catching but the least noise of
 this dies instantly i have seen her die twenty
 times upon far poorer moment i do think there is
 mettle in death which commits some loving act upon
 her she hath such a celerity in dying
mark antony she is cunning past man's thought
 exit alexas
domitius enobarbus alack sir no her passions are made of nothing but
 the finest part of pure love we cannot call her
 winds and waters sighs and tears they are greater
 storms and tempests than almanacs can report this
 cannot be cunning in her if it be she makes a
 shower of rain as well as jove
mark antony would i had never seen her
domitius enobarbus o sir you had then left unseen a wonderful piece
 of work which not to have been blest withal would
 have discredited your travel
mark antony fulvia is dead
domitius enobarbus sir
mark antony fulvia is dead
domitius enobarbus fulvia
mark antony dead
domitius enobarbus why sir give the gods a thankful sacrifice when
 it pleaseth their deities to take the wife of a man
 from him it shows to man the tailors of the earth
 comforting therein that when old robes are worn
 out there are members to make new if there were
 no more women but fulvia then had you indeed a cut
 and the case to be lamented this grief is crowned
 with consolation your old smock brings forth a new
 petticoat and indeed the tears live in an onion
 that should water this sorrow
mark antony the business she hath broached in the state
 cannot endure my absence
domitius enobarbus and the business you have broached here cannot be
 without you especially that of cleopatra's which
 wholly depends on your abode
mark antony no more light answers let our officers
 have notice what we purpose i shall break
 the cause of our expedience to the queen
 and get her leave to part for not alone
 the death of fulvia with more urgent touches
 do strongly speak to us but the letters too
 of many our contriving friends in rome
 petition us at home sextus pompeius
 hath given the dare to caesar and commands
 the empire of the sea our slippery people
 whose love is never link'd to the deserver
 till his deserts are past begin to throw
 pompey the great and all his dignities
 upon his son who high in name and power
 higher than both in blood and life stands up
 for the main soldier whose quality going on
 the sides o the world may danger much is breeding
 which like the courser's hair hath yet but life
 and not a serpent's poison say our pleasure
 to such whose place is under us requires
 our quick remove from hence
domitius enobarbus i shall do't
 exeunt
 antony and cleopatra
act i
scene iii the same another room
 enter cleopatra charmian iras and alexas
cleopatra where is he
charmian i did not see him since
cleopatra see where he is who's with him what he does
 i did not send you if you find him sad
 say i am dancing if in mirth report
 that i am sudden sick quick and return
 exit alexas
charmian madam methinks if you did love him dearly
 you do not hold the method to enforce
 the like from him
cleopatra what should i do i do not
charmian in each thing give him way cross him nothing
cleopatra thou teachest like a fool the way to lose him
charmian tempt him not so too far i wish forbear
 in time we hate that which we often fear
 but here comes antony
 enter mark antony
cleopatra i am sick and sullen
mark antony i am sorry to give breathing to my purpose
cleopatra help me away dear charmian i shall fall
 it cannot be thus long the sides of nature
 will not sustain it
mark antony now my dearest queen
cleopatra pray you stand further from me
mark antony what's the matter
cleopatra i know by that same eye there's some good news
 what says the married woman you may go
 would she had never given you leave to come
 let her not say tis i that keep you here
 i have no power upon you hers you are
mark antony the gods best know
cleopatra o never was there queen
 so mightily betray'd yet at the first
 i saw the treasons planted
mark antony cleopatra
cleopatra why should i think you can be mine and true
 though you in swearing shake the throned gods
 who have been false to fulvia riotous madness
 to be entangled with those mouthmade vows
 which break themselves in swearing
mark antony most sweet queen
cleopatra nay pray you seek no colour for your going
 but bid farewell and go when you sued staying
 then was the time for words no going then
 eternity was in our lips and eyes
 bliss in our brows bent none our parts so poor
 but was a race of heaven they are so still
 or thou the greatest soldier of the world
 art turn'd the greatest liar
mark antony how now lady
cleopatra i would i had thy inches thou shouldst know
 there were a heart in egypt
mark antony hear me queen
 the strong necessity of time commands
 our services awhile but my full heart
 remains in use with you our italy
 shines o'er with civil swords sextus pompeius
 makes his approaches to the port of rome
 equality of two domestic powers
 breed scrupulous faction the hated grown to strength
 are newly grown to love the condemn'd pompey
 rich in his father's honour creeps apace
 into the hearts of such as have not thrived
 upon the present state whose numbers threaten
 and quietness grown sick of rest would purge
 by any desperate change my more particular
 and that which most with you should safe my going
 is fulvia's death
cleopatra though age from folly could not give me freedom
 it does from childishness can fulvia die
mark antony she's dead my queen
 look here and at thy sovereign leisure read
 the garboils she awaked at the last best
 see when and where she died
cleopatra o most false love
 where be the sacred vials thou shouldst fill
 with sorrowful water now i see i see
 in fulvia's death how mine received shall be
mark antony quarrel no more but be prepared to know
 the purposes i bear which are or cease
 as you shall give the advice by the fire
 that quickens nilus slime i go from hence
 thy soldier servant making peace or war
 as thou affect'st
cleopatra cut my lace charmian come
 but let it be i am quickly ill and well
 so antony loves
mark antony my precious queen forbear
 and give true evidence to his love which stands
 an honourable trial
cleopatra so fulvia told me
 i prithee turn aside and weep for her
 then bid adieu to me and say the tears
 belong to egypt good now play one scene
 of excellent dissembling and let it look
 life perfect honour
mark antony you'll heat my blood no more
cleopatra you can do better yet but this is meetly
mark antony now by my sword
cleopatra and target still he mends
 but this is not the best look prithee charmian
 how this herculean roman does become
 the carriage of his chafe
mark antony i'll leave you lady
cleopatra courteous lord one word
 sir you and i must part but that's not it
 sir you and i have loved but there's not it
 that you know well something it is i would
 o my oblivion is a very antony
 and i am all forgotten
mark antony but that your royalty
 holds idleness your subject i should take you
 for idleness itself
cleopatra tis sweating labour
 to bear such idleness so near the heart
 as cleopatra this but sir forgive me
 since my becomings kill me when they do not
 eye well to you your honour calls you hence
 therefore be deaf to my unpitied folly
 and all the gods go with you upon your sword
