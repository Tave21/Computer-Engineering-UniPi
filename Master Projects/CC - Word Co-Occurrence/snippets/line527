katharina what will you not suffer me nay now i see
 she is your treasure she must have a husband
 i must dance barefoot on her wedding day
 and for your love to her lead apes in hell
 talk not to me i will go sit and weep
 till i can find occasion of revenge
 exit
baptista was ever gentleman thus grieved as i
 but who comes here
 enter gremio lucentio in the habit of a mean man
 petruchio with hortensio as a musician and tranio
 with biondello bearing a lute and books
gremio good morrow neighbour baptista
baptista good morrow neighbour gremio
 god save you gentlemen
petruchio and you good sir pray have you not a daughter
 call'd katharina fair and virtuous
baptista i have a daughter sir called katharina
gremio you are too blunt go to it orderly
petruchio you wrong me signior gremio give me leave
 i am a gentleman of verona sir
 that hearing of her beauty and her wit
 her affability and bashful modesty
 her wondrous qualities and mild behavior
 am bold to show myself a forward guest
 within your house to make mine eye the witness
 of that report which i so oft have heard
 and for an entrance to my entertainment
 i do present you with a man of mine
 presenting hortensio
 cunning in music and the mathematics
 to instruct her fully in those sciences
 whereof i know she is not ignorant
 accept of him or else you do me wrong
 his name is licio born in mantua
baptista you're welcome sir and he for your good sake
 but for my daughter katharina this i know
 she is not for your turn the more my grief
petruchio i see you do not mean to part with her
 or else you like not of my company
baptista mistake me not i speak but as i find
 whence are you sir what may i call your name
petruchio petruchio is my name antonio's son
 a man well known throughout all italy
baptista i know him well you are welcome for his sake
gremio saving your tale petruchio i pray
 let us that are poor petitioners speak too
 baccare you are marvellous forward
petruchio o pardon me signior gremio i would fain be doing
gremio i doubt it not sir but you will curse your
 wooing neighbour this is a gift very grateful i am
 sure of it to express the like kindness myself
 that have been more kindly beholding to you than
 any freely give unto you this young scholar
 presenting lucentio
 that hath been long studying at rheims as cunning
 in greek latin and other languages as the other
 in music and mathematics his name is cambio pray
 accept his service
baptista a thousand thanks signior gremio
 welcome good cambio
 to tranio
 but gentle sir methinks you walk like a stranger
 may i be so bold to know the cause of your coming
tranio pardon me sir the boldness is mine own
 that being a stranger in this city here
 do make myself a suitor to your daughter
 unto bianca fair and virtuous
 nor is your firm resolve unknown to me
 in the preferment of the eldest sister
 this liberty is all that i request
 that upon knowledge of my parentage
 i may have welcome mongst the rest that woo
 and free access and favour as the rest
 and toward the education of your daughters
 i here bestow a simple instrument
 and this small packet of greek and latin books
 if you accept them then their worth is great
baptista lucentio is your name of whence i pray
tranio of pisa sir son to vincentio
baptista a mighty man of pisa by report
 i know him well you are very welcome sir
 take you the lute and you the set of books
 you shall go see your pupils presently
 holla within
 enter a servant
 sirrah lead these gentlemen
 to my daughters and tell them both
 these are their tutors bid them use them well
 exit servant with lucentio and hortensio
 biondello following
 we will go walk a little in the orchard
 and then to dinner you are passing welcome
 and so i pray you all to think yourselves
petruchio signior baptista my business asketh haste
 and every day i cannot come to woo
 you knew my father well and in him me
 left solely heir to all his lands and goods
 which i have better'd rather than decreased
 then tell me if i get your daughter's love
 what dowry shall i have with her to wife
baptista after my death the one half of my lands
 and in possession twenty thousand crowns
petruchio and for that dowry i'll assure her of
 her widowhood be it that she survive me
 in all my lands and leases whatsoever
 let specialties be therefore drawn between us
 that covenants may be kept on either hand
baptista ay when the special thing is well obtain'd
 that is her love for that is all in all
petruchio why that is nothing for i tell you father
 i am as peremptory as she proudminded
 and where two raging fires meet together
 they do consume the thing that feeds their fury
 though little fire grows great with little wind
 yet extreme gusts will blow out fire and all
 so i to her and so she yields to me
 for i am rough and woo not like a babe
baptista well mayst thou woo and happy be thy speed
 but be thou arm'd for some unhappy words
petruchio ay to the proof as mountains are for winds
 that shake not though they blow perpetually
 reenter hortensio with his head broke
baptista how now my friend why dost thou look so pale
hortensio for fear i promise you if i look pale
baptista what will my daughter prove a good musician
hortensio i think she'll sooner prove a soldier
 iron may hold with her but never lutes
baptista why then thou canst not break her to the lute
hortensio why no for she hath broke the lute to me
 i did but tell her she mistook her frets
 and bow'd her hand to teach her fingering
 when with a most impatient devilish spirit
 frets call you these quoth she i'll fume
 with them'
 and with that word she struck me on the head
 and through the instrument my pate made way
 and there i stood amazed for a while
 as on a pillory looking through the lute
 while she did call me rascal fiddler
 and twangling jack with twenty such vile terms
 as had she studied to misuse me so
petruchio now by the world it is a lusty wench
 i love her ten times more than e'er i did
 o how i long to have some chat with her
baptista well go with me and be not so discomfited
 proceed in practise with my younger daughter
 she's apt to learn and thankful for good turns
 signior petruchio will you go with us
 or shall i send my daughter kate to you
petruchio i pray you do
 exeunt all but petruchio
 i will attend her here
 and woo her with some spirit when she comes
 say that she rail why then i'll tell her plain
 she sings as sweetly as a nightingale
 say that she frown i'll say she looks as clear
 as morning roses newly wash'd with dew
 say she be mute and will not speak a word
 then i'll commend her volubility
 and say she uttereth piercing eloquence
 if she do bid me pack i'll give her thanks
 as though she bid me stay by her a week
 if she deny to wed i'll crave the day
 when i shall ask the banns and when be married
 but here she comes and now petruchio speak
 enter katharina
 good morrow kate for that's your name i hear
katharina well have you heard but something hard of hearing
 they call me katharina that do talk of me
petruchio you lie in faith for you are call'd plain kate
 and bonny kate and sometimes kate the curst
 but kate the prettiest kate in christendom
 kate of kate hall my superdainty kate
 for dainties are all kates and therefore kate
 take this of me kate of my consolation
 hearing thy mildness praised in every town
 thy virtues spoke of and thy beauty sounded
 yet not so deeply as to thee belongs
 myself am moved to woo thee for my wife
katharina moved in good time let him that moved you hither
 remove you hence i knew you at the first
 you were a moveable
petruchio why what's a moveable
katharina a join'dstool
petruchio thou hast hit it come sit on me
katharina asses are made to bear and so are you
petruchio women are made to bear and so are you
katharina no such jade as you if me you mean
petruchio alas good kate i will not burden thee
 for knowing thee to be but young and light
katharina too light for such a swain as you to catch
 and yet as heavy as my weight should be
petruchio should be shouldbuzz
katharina well ta'en and like a buzzard
petruchio o slowwing'd turtle shall a buzzard take thee
katharina ay for a turtle as he takes a buzzard
petruchio come come you wasp i faith you are too angry
katharina if i be waspish best beware my sting
petruchio my remedy is then to pluck it out
