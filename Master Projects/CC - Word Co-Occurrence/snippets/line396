adriana within who is that at the door that keeps all
 this noise

 unruly boys

 fain have either
balthazar in debating which was best we shall part with neither
dromio of ephesus they stand at the door master bid them welcome hither
antipholus
of ephesus there is something in the wind that we cannot get in
dromio of ephesus you would say so master if your garments were thin
 your cake there is warm within you stand here in the cold
 it would make a man mad as a buck to be so bought and sold
antipholus
of ephesus go fetch me something i'll break ope the gate
dromio of syracuse within break any breaking here and i'll break your
 knave's pate
dromio of ephesus a man may break a word with you sir and words are but wind

of ephesus go get thee gone fetch me an iron crow
balthazar have patience sir o let it not be so
 herein you war against your reputation
 and draw within the compass of suspect
 the unviolated honour of your wife
 once thisyour long experience of her wisdom
 her sober virtue years and modesty
 plead on her part some cause to you unknown
 and doubt not sir but she will well excuse
 why at this time the doors are made against you
 be ruled by me depart in patience
 and let us to the tiger all to dinner
 and about evening come yourself alone
 to know the reason of this strange restraint
 if by strong hand you offer to break in
 now in the stirring passage of the day
 a vulgar comment will be made of it
 and that supposed by the common rout
 against your yet ungalled estimation
 that may with foul intrusion enter in
 and dwell upon your grave when you are dead
 for slander lives upon succession
 for ever housed where it gets possession
antipholus
of ephesus you have prevailed i will depart in quiet
 and in despite of mirth mean to be merry
 i know a wench of excellent discourse
 pretty and witty wild and yet too gentle
 there will we dine this woman that i mean
 my wifebut i protest without desert
 hath oftentimes upbraided me withal
 to her will we to dinner

 get you home
 and fetch the chain by this i know tis made
 bring it i pray you to the porpentine
 for there's the house that chain will i bestow
 be it for nothing but to spite my wife
 upon mine hostess there good sir make haste
 since mine own doors refuse to entertain me
 i'll knock elsewhere to see if they'll disdain me
angelo i'll meet you at that place some hour hence
antipholus
of ephesus do so this jest shall cost me some expense
 exeunt
 the comedy of errors
act iii
scene ii the same
 enter luciana and antipholus of syracuse
luciana and may it be that you have quite forgot
 a husband's office shall antipholus
 even in the spring of love thy lovesprings rot
 shall love in building grow so ruinous
 if you did wed my sister for her wealth
 then for her wealth's sake use her with more kindness
 or if you like elsewhere do it by stealth
 muffle your false love with some show of blindness
 let not my sister read it in your eye
 be not thy tongue thy own shame's orator
 look sweet be fair become disloyalty
 apparel vice like virtue's harbinger
 bear a fair presence though your heart be tainted
 teach sin the carriage of a holy saint
 be secretfalse what need she be acquainted
 what simple thief brags of his own attaint
 tis double wrong to truant with your bed
 and let her read it in thy looks at board
 shame hath a bastard fame well managed
 ill deeds are doubled with an evil word
 alas poor women make us but believe
 being compact of credit that you love us
 though others have the arm show us the sleeve
 we in your motion turn and you may move us
 then gentle brother get you in again
 comfort my sister cheer her call her wife
 tis holy sport to be a little vain
 when the sweet breath of flattery conquers strife
antipholus
of syracuse sweet mistresswhat your name is else i know not
 nor by what wonder you do hit of mine
 less in your knowledge and your grace you show not
 than our earth's wonder more than earth divine
 teach me dear creature how to think and speak
 lay open to my earthygross conceit
 smother'd in errors feeble shallow weak
 the folded meaning of your words deceit
 against my soul's pure truth why labour you
 to make it wander in an unknown field
 are you a god would you create me new
 transform me then and to your power i'll yield
 but if that i am i then well i know
 your weeping sister is no wife of mine
 nor to her bed no homage do i owe
 far more far more to you do i decline
 o train me not sweet mermaid with thy note
 to drown me in thy sister's flood of tears
 sing siren for thyself and i will dote
 spread o'er the silver waves thy golden hairs
 and as a bed i'll take them and there lie
 and in that glorious supposition think
 he gains by death that hath such means to die
 let love being light be drowned if she sink
luciana what are you mad that you do reason so
antipholus
of syracuse not mad but mated how i do not know
luciana it is a fault that springeth from your eye
antipholus
of syracuse for gazing on your beams fair sun being by
luciana gaze where you should and that will clear your sight
antipholus
of syracuse as good to wink sweet love as look on night
luciana why call you me love call my sister so
antipholus
of syracuse thy sister's sister
luciana that's my sister
antipholus
of syracuse no
 it is thyself mine own self's better part
 mine eye's clear eye my dear heart's dearer heart
 my food my fortune and my sweet hope's aim
 my sole earth's heaven and my heaven's claim
luciana all this my sister is or else should be
antipholus
of syracuse call thyself sister sweet for i am thee
 thee will i love and with thee lead my life
 thou hast no husband yet nor i no wife
 give me thy hand
luciana o soft air hold you still
 i'll fetch my sister to get her good will
