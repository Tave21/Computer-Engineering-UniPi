2chr365 jehoiakim was twenty and five years old when he began to reign and he reigned eleven years in jerusalem and he did that which was evil in the sight of the lord his god
2chr366 against him came up nebuchadnezzar king of babylon and bound him in fetters to carry him to babylon
2chr367 nebuchadnezzar also carried of the vessels of the house of the lord to babylon and put them in his temple at babylon
2chr368 now the rest of the acts of jehoiakim and his abominations which he did and that which was found in him behold they are written in the book of the kings of israel and judah and jehoiachin his son reigned in his stead
2chr369 jehoiachin was eight years old when he began to reign and he reigned three months and ten days in jerusalem and he did that which was evil in the sight of the lord
2chr3610 and when the year was expired king nebuchadnezzar sent and brought him to babylon with the goodly vessels of the house of the lord and made zedekiah his brother king over judah and jerusalem
2chr3611 zedekiah was one and twenty years old when he began to reign and reigned eleven years in jerusalem
2chr3612 and he did that which was evil in the sight of the lord his god and humbled not himself before jeremiah the prophet speaking from the mouth of the lord
2chr3613 and he also rebelled against king nebuchadnezzar who had made him swear by god but he stiffened his neck and hardened his heart from turning unto the lord god of israel
2chr3614 moreover all the chief of the priests and the people transgressed very much after all the abominations of the heathen and polluted the house of the lord which he had hallowed in jerusalem
2chr3615 and the lord god of their fathers sent to them by his messengers rising up betimes and sending because he had compassion on his people and on his dwelling place
2chr3616 but they mocked the messengers of god and despised his words and misused his prophets until the wrath of the lord arose against his people till there was no remedy
2chr3617 therefore he brought upon them the king of the chaldees who slew their young men with the sword in the house of their sanctuary and had no compassion upon young man or maiden old man or him that stooped for age he gave them all into his hand
2chr3618 and all the vessels of the house of god great and small and the treasures of the house of the lord and the treasures of the king and of his princes all these he brought to babylon
2chr3619 and they burnt the house of god and brake down the wall of jerusalem and burnt all the palaces thereof with fire and destroyed all the goodly vessels thereof
2chr3620 and them that had escaped from the sword carried he away to babylon where they were servants to him and his sons until the reign of the kingdom of persia
2chr3621 to fulfil the word of the lord by the mouth of jeremiah until the land had enjoyed her sabbaths for as long as she lay desolate she kept sabbath to fulfil threescore and ten years
2chr3622 now in the first year of cyrus king of persia that the word of the lord spoken by the mouth of jeremiah might be accomplished the lord stirred up the spirit of cyrus king of persia that he made a proclamation throughout all his kingdom and put it also in writing saying
2chr3623 thus saith cyrus king of persia all the kingdoms of the earth hath the lord god of heaven given me and he hath charged me to build him an house in jerusalem which is in judah who is there among you of all his people the lord his god be with him and let him go up
now in the first year of cyrus king of persia that the word of the lord by the mouth of jeremiah might be fulfilled the lord stirred up the spirit of cyrus king of persia that he made a proclamation throughout all his kingdom and put it also in writing saying
thus saith cyrus king of persia the lord god of heaven hath given me all the kingdoms of the earth and he hath charged me to build him an house at jerusalem which is in judah
who is there among you of all his people his god be with him and let him go up to jerusalem which is in judah and build the house of the lord god of israel he is the god which is in jerusalem
and whosoever remaineth in any place where he sojourneth let the men of his place help him with silver and with gold and with goods and with beasts beside the freewill offering for the house of god that is in jerusalem
then rose up the chief of the fathers of judah and benjamin and the priests and the levites with all them whose spirit god had raised to go up to build the house of the lord which is in jerusalem
and all they that were about them strengthened their hands with vessels of silver with gold with goods and with beasts and with precious things beside all that was willingly offered
also cyrus the king brought forth the vessels of the house of the lord which nebuchadnezzar had brought forth out of jerusalem and had put them in the house of his gods
even those did cyrus king of persia bring forth by the hand of mithredath the treasurer and numbered them unto sheshbazzar the prince of judah
and this is the number of them thirty chargers of gold a thousand chargers of silver nine and twenty knives
thirty basons of gold silver basons of a second sort four hundred and ten and other vessels a thousand
all the vessels of gold and of silver were five thousand and four hundred all these did sheshbazzar bring up with them of the captivity that were brought up from babylon unto jerusalem
now these are the children of the province that went up out of the captivity of those which had been carried away whom nebuchadnezzar the king of babylon had carried away unto babylon and came again unto jerusalem and judah every one unto his city

and of the children of the priests the children of habaiah the children of koz the children of barzillai which took a wife of the daughters of barzillai the gileadite and was called after their name
these sought their register among those that were reckoned by genealogy but they were not found therefore were they as polluted put from the priesthood
and the tirshatha said unto them that they should not eat of the most holy things till there stood up a priest with urim and with thummim
the whole congregation together was forty and two thousand three hundred and threescore
beside their servants and their maids of whom there were seven thousand three hundred thirty and seven and there were among them two hundred singing men and singing women
their horses were seven hundred thirty and six their mules two hundred forty and five
their camels four hundred thirty and five their asses six thousand seven hundred and twenty
and some of the chief of the fathers when they came to the house of the lord which is at jerusalem offered freely for the house of god to set it up in his place
they gave after their ability unto the treasure of the work threescore and one thousand drams of gold and five thousand pound of silver and one hundred priests garments
so the priests and the levites and some of the people and the singers and the porters and the nethinims dwelt in their cities and all israel in their cities
and when the seventh month was come and the children of israel were in the cities the people gathered themselves together as one man to jerusalem
then stood up jeshua the son of jozadak and his brethren the priests and zerubbabel the son of shealtiel and his brethren and builded the altar of the god of israel to offer burnt offerings thereon as it is written in the law of moses the man of god
and they set the altar upon his bases for fear was upon them because of the people of those countries and they offered burnt offerings thereon unto the lord even burnt offerings morning and evening
they kept also the feast of tabernacles as it is written and offered the daily burnt offerings by number according to the custom as the duty of every day required
and afterward offered the continual burnt offering both of the new moons and of all the set feasts of the lord that were consecrated and of every one that willingly offered a freewill offering unto the lord
from the first day of the seventh month began they to offer burnt offerings unto the lord but the foundation of the temple of the lord was not yet laid
they gave money also unto the masons and to the carpenters and meat and drink and oil unto them of zidon and to them of tyre to bring cedar trees from lebanon to the sea of joppa according to the grant that they had of cyrus king of persia
now in the second year of their coming unto the house of god at jerusalem in the second month began zerubbabel the son of shealtiel and jeshua the son of jozadak and the remnant of their brethren the priests and the levites and all they that were come out of the captivity unto jerusalem and appointed the levites from twenty years old and upward to set forward the work of the house of the lord
then stood jeshua with his sons and his brethren kadmiel and his sons the sons of judah together to set forward the workmen in the house of god the sons of henadad with their sons and their brethren the levites
and when the builders laid the foundation of the temple of the lord they set the priests in their apparel with trumpets and the levites the sons of asaph with cymbals to praise the lord after the ordinance of david king of israel
and they sang together by course in praising and giving thanks unto the lord because he is good for his mercy endureth for ever toward israel and all the people shouted with a great shout when they praised the lord because the foundation of the house of the lord was laid
but many of the priests and levites and chief of the fathers who were ancient men that had seen the first house when the foundation of this house was laid before their eyes wept with a loud voice and many shouted aloud for joy
so that the people could not discern the noise of the shout of joy from the noise of the weeping of the people for the people shouted with a loud shout and the noise was heard afar off
now when the adversaries of judah and benjamin heard that the children of the captivity builded the temple unto the lord god of israel
then they came to zerubbabel and to the chief of the fathers and said unto them let us build with you for we seek your god as ye do and we do sacrifice unto him since the days of esarhaddon king of assur which brought us up hither
but zerubbabel and jeshua and the rest of the chief of the fathers of israel said unto them ye have nothing to do with us to build an house unto our god but we ourselves together will build unto the lord god of israel as king cyrus the king of persia hath commanded us
then the people of the land weakened the hands of the people of judah and troubled them in building
and hired counsellors against them to frustrate their purpose all the days of cyrus king of persia even until the reign of darius king of persia
and in the reign of ahasuerus in the beginning of his reign wrote they unto him an accusation against the inhabitants of judah and jerusalem
and in the days of artaxerxes wrote bishlam mithredath tabeel and the rest of their companions unto artaxerxes king of persia and the writing of the letter was written in the syrian tongue and interpreted in the syrian tongue
rehum the chancellor and shimshai the scribe wrote a letter against jerusalem to artaxerxes the king in this sort
then wrote rehum the chancellor and shimshai the scribe and the rest of their companions the dinaites the apharsathchites the tarpelites the apharsites the archevites the babylonians the susanchites the dehavites and the elamites
and the rest of the nations whom the great and noble asnapper brought over and set in the cities of samaria and the rest that are on this side the river and at such a time
this is the copy of the letter that they sent unto him even unto artaxerxes the king thy servants the men on this side the river and at such a time
be it known unto the king that the jews which came up from thee to us are come unto jerusalem building the rebellious and the bad city and have set up the walls thereof and joined the foundations
be it known now unto the king that if this city be builded and the walls set up again then will they not pay toll tribute and custom and so thou shalt endamage the revenue of the kings
now because we have maintenance from the king's palace and it was not meet for us to see the king's dishonour therefore have we sent and certified the king
that search may be made in the book of the records of thy fathers so shalt thou find in the book of the records and know that this city is a rebellious city and hurtful unto kings and provinces and that they have moved sedition within the same of old time for which cause was this city destroyed
we certify the king that if this city be builded again and the walls thereof set up by this means thou shalt have no portion on this side the river
then sent the king an answer unto rehum the chancellor and to shimshai the scribe and to the rest of their companions that dwell in samaria and unto the rest beyond the river peace and at such a time
the letter which ye sent unto us hath been plainly read before me
and i commanded and search hath been made and it is found that this city of old time hath made insurrection against kings and that rebellion and sedition have been made therein
there have been mighty kings also over jerusalem which have ruled over all countries beyond the river and toll tribute and custom was paid unto them
give ye now commandment to cause these men to cease and that this city be not builded until another commandment shall be given from me
take heed now that ye fail not to do this why should damage grow to the hurt of the kings
now when the copy of king artaxerxes letter was read before rehum and shimshai the scribe and their companions they went up in haste to jerusalem unto the jews and made them to cease by force and power
then ceased the work of the house of god which is at jerusalem so it ceased unto the second year of the reign of darius king of persia
then the prophets haggai the prophet and zechariah the son of iddo prophesied unto the jews that were in judah and jerusalem in the name of the god of israel even unto them
then rose up zerubbabel the son of shealtiel and jeshua the son of jozadak and began to build the house of god which is at jerusalem and with them were the prophets of god helping them
at the same time came to them tatnai governor on this side the river and shetharboznai and their companions and said thus unto them who hath commanded you to build this house and to make up this wall
then said we unto them after this manner what are the names of the men that make this building
but the eye of their god was upon the elders of the jews that they could not cause them to cease till the matter came to darius and then they returned answer by letter concerning this matter
the copy of the letter that tatnai governor on this side the river and shetharboznai and his companions the apharsachites which were on this side the river sent unto darius the king
they sent a letter unto him wherein was written thus unto darius the king all peace
be it known unto the king that we went into the province of judea to the house of the great god which is builded with great stones and timber is laid in the walls and this work goeth fast on and prospereth in their hands
then asked we those elders and said unto them thus who commanded you to build this house and to make up these walls
we asked their names also to certify thee that we might write the names of the men that were the chief of them
and thus they returned us answer saying we are the servants of the god of heaven and earth and build the house that was builded these many years ago which a great king of israel builded and set up
but after that our fathers had provoked the god of heaven unto wrath he gave them into the hand of nebuchadnezzar the king of babylon the chaldean who destroyed this house and carried the people away into babylon
but in the first year of cyrus the king of babylon the same king cyrus made a decree to build this house of god
and the vessels also of gold and silver of the house of god which nebuchadnezzar took out of the temple that was in jerusalem and brought them into the temple of babylon those did cyrus the king take out of the temple of babylon and they were delivered unto one whose name was sheshbazzar whom he had made governor
and said unto him take these vessels go carry them into the temple that is in jerusalem and let the house of god be builded in his place
then came the same sheshbazzar and laid the foundation of the house of god which is in jerusalem and since that time even until now hath it been in building and yet it is not finished
now therefore if it seem good to the king let there be search made in the king's treasure house which is there at babylon whether it be so that a decree was made of cyrus the king to build this house of god at jerusalem and let the king send his pleasure to us concerning this matter
then darius the king made a decree and search was made in the house of the rolls where the treasures were laid up in babylon
and there was found at achmetha in the palace that is in the province of the medes a roll and therein was a record thus written
in the first year of cyrus the king the same cyrus the king made a decree concerning the house of god at jerusalem let the house be builded the place where they offered sacrifices and let the foundations thereof be strongly laid the height thereof threescore cubits and the breadth thereof threescore cubits
with three rows of great stones and a row of new timber and let the expenses be given out of the king's house
and also let the golden and silver vessels of the house of god which nebuchadnezzar took forth out of the temple which is at jerusalem and brought unto babylon be restored and brought again unto the temple which is at jerusalem every one to his place and place them in the house of god
now therefore tatnai governor beyond the river shetharboznai and your companions the apharsachites which are beyond the river be ye far from thence
let the work of this house of god alone let the governor of the jews and the elders of the jews build this house of god in his place
moreover i make a decree what ye shall do to the elders of these jews for the building of this house of god that of the king's goods even of the tribute beyond the river forthwith expenses be given unto these men that they be not hindered
and that which they have need of both young bullocks and rams and lambs for the burnt offerings of the god of heaven wheat salt wine and oil according to the appointment of the priests which are at jerusalem let it be given them day by day without fail
that they may offer sacrifices of sweet savours unto the god of heaven and pray for the life of the king and of his sons
also i have made a decree that whosoever shall alter this word let timber be pulled down from his house and being set up let him be hanged thereon and let his house be made a dunghill for this
and the god that hath caused his name to dwell there destroy all kings and people that shall put to their hand to alter and to destroy this house of god which is at jerusalem i darius have made a decree let it be done with speed
then tatnai governor on this side the river shetharboznai and their companions according to that which darius the king had sent so they did speedily
and the elders of the jews builded and they prospered through the prophesying of haggai the prophet and zechariah the son of iddo and they builded and finished it according to the commandment of the god of israel and according to the commandment of cyrus and darius and artaxerxes king of persia
and this house was finished on the third day of the month adar which was in the sixth year of the reign of darius the king
and the children of israel the priests and the levites and the rest of the children of the captivity kept the dedication of this house of god with joy
and offered at the dedication of this house of god an hundred bullocks two hundred rams four hundred lambs and for a sin offering for all israel twelve he goats according to the number of the tribes of israel
and they set the priests in their divisions and the levites in their courses for the service of god which is at jerusalem as it is written in the book of moses
and the children of the captivity kept the passover upon the fourteenth day of the first month
for the priests and the levites were purified together all of them were pure and killed the passover for all the children of the captivity and for their brethren the priests and for themselves
and the children of israel which were come again out of captivity and all such as had separated themselves unto them from the filthiness of the heathen of the land to seek the lord god of israel did eat
and kept the feast of unleavened bread seven days with joy for the lord had made them joyful and turned the heart of the king of assyria unto them to strengthen their hands in the work of the house of god the god of israel
now after these things in the reign of artaxerxes king of persia ezra the son of seraiah the son of azariah the son of hilkiah
the son of shallum the son of zadok the son of ahitub
the son of amariah the son of azariah the son of meraioth
the son of zerahiah the son of uzzi the son of bukki
the son of abishua the son of phinehas the son of eleazar the son of aaron the chief priest
this ezra went up from babylon and he was a ready scribe in the law of moses which the lord god of israel had given and the king granted him all his request according to the hand of the lord his god upon him
and there went up some of the children of israel and of the priests and the levites and the singers and the porters and the nethinims unto jerusalem in the seventh year of artaxerxes the king
and he came to jerusalem in the fifth month which was in the seventh year of the king
for upon the first day of the first month began he to go up from babylon and on the first day of the fifth month came he to jerusalem according to the good hand of his god upon him
for ezra had prepared his heart to seek the law of the lord and to do it and to teach in israel statutes and judgments
now this is the copy of the letter that the king artaxerxes gave unto ezra the priest the scribe even a scribe of the words of the commandments of the lord and of his statutes to israel
artaxerxes king of kings unto ezra the priest a scribe of the law of the god of heaven perfect peace and at such a time
i make a decree that all they of the people of israel and of his priests and levites in my realm which are minded of their own freewill to go up to jerusalem go with thee
forasmuch as thou art sent of the king and of his seven counsellors to enquire concerning judah and jerusalem according to the law of thy god which is in thine hand
and to carry the silver and gold which the king and his counsellors have freely offered unto the god of israel whose habitation is in jerusalem
and all the silver and gold that thou canst find in all the province of babylon with the freewill offering of the people and of the priests offering willingly for the house of their god which is in jerusalem
that thou mayest buy speedily with this money bullocks rams lambs with their meat offerings and their drink offerings and offer them upon the altar of the house of your god which is in jerusalem
and whatsoever shall seem good to thee and to thy brethren to do with the rest of the silver and the gold that do after the will of your god
the vessels also that are given thee for the service of the house of thy god those deliver thou before the god of jerusalem
and whatsoever more shall be needful for the house of thy god which thou shalt have occasion to bestow bestow it out of the king's treasure house
and i even i artaxerxes the king do make a decree to all the treasurers which are beyond the river that whatsoever ezra the priest the scribe of the law of the god of heaven shall require of you it be done speedily
unto an hundred talents of silver and to an hundred measures of wheat and to an hundred baths of wine and to an hundred baths of oil and salt without prescribing how much
whatsoever is commanded by the god of heaven let it be diligently done for the house of the god of heaven for why should there be wrath against the realm of the king and his sons
also we certify you that touching any of the priests and levites singers porters nethinims or ministers of this house of god it shall not be lawful to impose toll tribute or custom upon them
