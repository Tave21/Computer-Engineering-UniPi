duncan is execution done on cawdor are not
 those in commission yet return'd
malcolm my liege
 they are not yet come back but i have spoke
 with one that saw him die who did report
 that very frankly he confess'd his treasons
 implored your highness pardon and set forth
 a deep repentance nothing in his life
 became him like the leaving it he died
 as one that had been studied in his death
 to throw away the dearest thing he owed
 as twere a careless trifle
duncan there's no art
 to find the mind's construction in the face
 he was a gentleman on whom i built
 an absolute trust
 enter macbeth banquo ross and angus
 o worthiest cousin
 the sin of my ingratitude even now
 was heavy on me thou art so far before
 that swiftest wing of recompense is slow
 to overtake thee would thou hadst less deserved
 that the proportion both of thanks and payment
 might have been mine only i have left to say
 more is thy due than more than all can pay
macbeth the service and the loyalty i owe
 in doing it pays itself your highness part
 is to receive our duties and our duties
 are to your throne and state children and servants
 which do but what they should by doing every thing
 safe toward your love and honour
duncan welcome hither
 i have begun to plant thee and will labour
 to make thee full of growing noble banquo
 that hast no less deserved nor must be known
 no less to have done so let me enfold thee
 and hold thee to my heart
banquo there if i grow
 the harvest is your own
duncan my plenteous joys
 wanton in fulness seek to hide themselves
 in drops of sorrow sons kinsmen thanes
 and you whose places are the nearest know
 we will establish our estate upon
 our eldest malcolm whom we name hereafter
 the prince of cumberland which honour must
 not unaccompanied invest him only
 but signs of nobleness like stars shall shine
 on all deservers from hence to inverness
 and bind us further to you
macbeth the rest is labour which is not used for you
 i'll be myself the harbinger and make joyful
 the hearing of my wife with your approach
 so humbly take my leave
duncan my worthy cawdor
macbeth aside the prince of cumberland that is a step
 on which i must fall down or else o'erleap
 for in my way it lies stars hide your fires
 let not light see my black and deep desires
 the eye wink at the hand yet let that be
 which the eye fears when it is done to see
 exit
duncan true worthy banquo he is full so valiant
 and in his commendations i am fed
 it is a banquet to me let's after him
 whose care is gone before to bid us welcome
 it is a peerless kinsman

scene v inverness macbeth's castle
 enter lady macbeth reading a letter
lady macbeth they met me in the day of success and i have
 learned by the perfectest report they have more in
 them than mortal knowledge when i burned in desire
 to question them further they made themselves air
 into which they vanished whiles i stood rapt in
 the wonder of it came missives from the king who
 allhailed me thane of cawdor by which title
 before these weird sisters saluted me and referred
 me to the coming on of time with hail king that
 shalt be this have i thought good to deliver
 thee my dearest partner of greatness that thou
 mightst not lose the dues of rejoicing by being
 ignorant of what greatness is promised thee lay it
 to thy heart and farewell'
 glamis thou art and cawdor and shalt be
 what thou art promised yet do i fear thy nature
 it is too full o the milk of human kindness
 to catch the nearest way thou wouldst be great
 art not without ambition but without
 the illness should attend it what thou wouldst highly
 that wouldst thou holily wouldst not play false
 and yet wouldst wrongly win thou'ldst have great glamis
 that which cries thus thou must do if thou have it
 and that which rather thou dost fear to do
 than wishest should be undone hie thee hither
 that i may pour my spirits in thine ear
 and chastise with the valour of my tongue
 all that impedes thee from the golden round
 which fate and metaphysical aid doth seem
 to have thee crown'd withal
 enter a messenger
 what is your tidings
messenger the king comes here tonight
lady macbeth thou'rt mad to say it
 is not thy master with him who were't so
 would have inform'd for preparation
messenger so please you it is true our thane is coming
 one of my fellows had the speed of him
 who almost dead for breath had scarcely more
 than would make up his message
lady macbeth give him tending
 he brings great news
 exit messenger
 the raven himself is hoarse
 that croaks the fatal entrance of duncan
 under my battlements come you spirits
 that tend on mortal thoughts unsex me here
 and fill me from the crown to the toe topfull
 of direst cruelty make thick my blood
 stop up the access and passage to remorse
 that no compunctious visitings of nature
 shake my fell purpose nor keep peace between
 the effect and it come to my woman's breasts
 and take my milk for gall you murdering ministers
 wherever in your sightless substances
 you wait on nature's mischief come thick night
 and pall thee in the dunnest smoke of hell
 that my keen knife see not the wound it makes
 nor heaven peep through the blanket of the dark
 to cry hold hold'
 enter macbeth
 great glamis worthy cawdor
 greater than both by the allhail hereafter
 thy letters have transported me beyond
 this ignorant present and i feel now
 the future in the instant
macbeth my dearest love
 duncan comes here tonight
lady macbeth and when goes hence
macbeth tomorrow as he purposes
lady macbeth o never
 shall sun that morrow see
 your face my thane is as a book where men
 may read strange matters to beguile the time
 look like the time bear welcome in your eye
 your hand your tongue look like the innocent flower
 but be the serpent under't he that's coming
 must be provided for and you shall put
 this night's great business into my dispatch
 which shall to all our nights and days to come
 give solely sovereign sway and masterdom
macbeth we will speak further
lady macbeth only look up clear
 to alter favour ever is to fear
 leave all the rest to me

 by his loved mansionry that the heaven's breath

 the love that follows us sometime is our trouble
 which still we thank as love herein i teach you
 how you shall bid god ild us for your pains
 and thank us for your trouble

 against those honours deep and broad wherewith
 your majesty loads our house for those of old
 and the late dignities heap'd up to them
 we rest your hermits

 to be his purveyor but he rides well
 and his great love sharp as his spur hath holp him
 to his home before us fair and noble hostess

 have theirs themselves and what is theirs in compt
