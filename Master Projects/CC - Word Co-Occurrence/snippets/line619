act iii
scene i bangor the archdeacon's house
 enter hotspur worcester mortimer and glendower
mortimer these promises are fair the parties sure
 and our induction full of prosperous hope
hotspur lord mortimer and cousin glendower
 will you sit down
 and uncle worcester a plague upon it
 i have forgot the map
glendower no here it is
 sit cousin percy sit good cousin hotspur
 for by that name as oft as lancaster
 doth speak of you his cheek looks pale and with
 a rising sigh he wisheth you in heaven
hotspur and you in hell as oft as he hears owen glendower spoke of
glendower i cannot blame him at my nativity
 the front of heaven was full of fiery shapes
 of burning cressets and at my birth
 the frame and huge foundation of the earth
 shaked like a coward
hotspur why so it would have done at the same season if
 your mother's cat had but kittened though yourself
 had never been born
glendower i say the earth did shake when i was born
hotspur and i say the earth was not of my mind
 if you suppose as fearing you it shook
glendower the heavens were all on fire the earth did tremble
hotspur o then the earth shook to see the heavens on fire
 and not in fear of your nativity
 diseased nature oftentimes breaks forth
 in strange eruptions oft the teeming earth
 is with a kind of colic pinch'd and vex'd
 by the imprisoning of unruly wind
 within her womb which for enlargement striving
 shakes the old beldam earth and topples down
 steeples and mossgrown towers at your birth
 our grandam earth having this distemperature
 in passion shook
glendower cousin of many men
 i do not bear these crossings give me leave
 to tell you once again that at my birth
 the front of heaven was full of fiery shapes
 the goats ran from the mountains and the herds
 were strangely clamorous to the frighted fields
 these signs have mark'd me extraordinary
 and all the courses of my life do show
 i am not in the roll of common men
 where is he living clipp'd in with the sea
 that chides the banks of england scotland wales
 which calls me pupil or hath read to me
 and bring him out that is but woman's son
 can trace me in the tedious ways of art
 and hold me pace in deep experiments
hotspur i think there's no man speaks better welsh
 i'll to dinner
mortimer peace cousin percy you will make him mad
glendower i can call spirits from the vasty deep
hotspur why so can i or so can any man
 but will they come when you do call for them
glendower why i can teach you cousin to command
 the devil
hotspur and i can teach thee coz to shame the devil
 by telling truth tell truth and shame the devil
 if thou have power to raise him bring him hither
 and i'll be sworn i have power to shame him hence
 o while you live tell truth and shame the devil
mortimer come come no more of this unprofitable chat
glendower three times hath henry bolingbroke made head
 against my power thrice from the banks of wye
 and sandybottom'd severn have i sent him
 bootless home and weatherbeaten back
hotspur home without boots and in foul weather too
 how scapes he agues in the devil's name
glendower come here's the map shall we divide our right
 according to our threefold order ta'en
mortimer the archdeacon hath divided it
 into three limits very equally
 england from trent and severn hitherto
 by south and east is to my part assign'd
