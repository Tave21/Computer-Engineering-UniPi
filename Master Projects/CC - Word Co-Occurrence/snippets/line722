 a strange tongue makes my cause more strange
 suspicious
 pray speak in english here are some will thank you
 if you speak truth for their poor mistress sake
 believe me she has had much wrong lord cardinal
 the willing'st sin i ever yet committed
 may be absolved in english
cardinal wolsey noble lady
 i am sorry my integrity should breed
 and service to his majesty and you
 so deep suspicion where all faith was meant
 we come not by the way of accusation
 to taint that honour every good tongue blesses
 nor to betray you any way to sorrow
 you have too much good lady but to know
 how you stand minded in the weighty difference
 between the king and you and to deliver
 like free and honest men our just opinions
 and comforts to your cause
cardinal campeius most honour'd madam
 my lord of york out of his noble nature
 zeal and obedience he still bore your grace
 forgetting like a good man your late censure
 both of his truth and him which was too far
 offers as i do in a sign of peace
 his service and his counsel
queen katharine aside to betray me
 my lords i thank you both for your good wills
 ye speak like honest men pray god ye prove so
 but how to make ye suddenly an answer
 in such a point of weight so near mine honour
 more near my life i fearwith my weak wit
 and to such men of gravity and learning
 in truth i know not i was set at work
 among my maids full little god knows looking
 either for such men or such business
 for her sake that i have beenfor i feel
 the last fit of my greatnessgood your graces
 let me have time and counsel for my cause
 alas i am a woman friendless hopeless
cardinal wolsey madam you wrong the king's love with these fears
 your hopes and friends are infinite
queen katharine in england
 but little for my profit can you think lords
 that any englishman dare give me counsel
 or be a known friend gainst his highness pleasure
 though he be grown so desperate to be honest
 and live a subject nay forsooth my friends
 they that must weigh out my afflictions
 they that my trust must grow to live not here
 they are as all my other comforts far hence
 in mine own country lords
cardinal campeius i would your grace
 would leave your griefs and take my counsel
queen katharine how sir
cardinal campeius put your main cause into the king's protection
 he's loving and most gracious twill be much
 both for your honour better and your cause
 for if the trial of the law o'ertake ye
 you'll part away disgraced
cardinal wolsey he tells you rightly
queen katharine ye tell me what ye wish for bothmy ruin
 is this your christian counsel out upon ye
 heaven is above all yet there sits a judge
 that no king can corrupt
cardinal campeius your rage mistakes us
queen katharine the more shame for ye holy men i thought ye
 upon my soul two reverend cardinal virtues
 but cardinal sins and hollow hearts i fear ye
 mend em for shame my lords is this your comfort
 the cordial that ye bring a wretched lady
 a woman lost among ye laugh'd at scorn'd
 i will not wish ye half my miseries
 i have more charity but say i warn'd ye
 take heed for heaven's sake take heed lest at once
 the burthen of my sorrows fall upon ye
cardinal wolsey madam this is a mere distraction
 you turn the good we offer into envy
queen katharine ye turn me into nothing woe upon ye
 and all such false professors would you have me
 if you have any justice any pity
 if ye be any thing but churchmen's habits
 put my sick cause into his hands that hates me
 alas has banish'd me his bed already
 his love too long ago i am old my lords
 and all the fellowship i hold now with him
 is only my obedience what can happen
 to me above this wretchedness all your studies
 make me a curse like this
cardinal campeius your fears are worse
queen katharine have i lived thus longlet me speak myself
 since virtue finds no friendsa wife a true one
 a woman i dare say without vainglory
 never yet branded with suspicion
 have i with all my full affections
 still met the king loved him next heaven
 obey'd him
 been out of fondness superstitious to him
 almost forgot my prayers to content him
 and am i thus rewarded tis not well lords
 bring me a constant woman to her husband
 one that ne'er dream'd a joy beyond his pleasure
 and to that woman when she has done most
 yet will i add an honour a great patience
cardinal wolsey madam you wander from the good we aim at
queen katharine my lord i dare not make myself so guilty
 to give up willingly that noble title
 your master wed me to nothing but death
 shall e'er divorce my dignities
cardinal wolsey pray hear me
queen katharine would i had never trod this english earth
 or felt the flatteries that grow upon it
 ye have angels faces but heaven knows your hearts
 what will become of me now wretched lady
 i am the most unhappy woman living
 alas poor wenches where are now your fortunes
 shipwreck'd upon a kingdom where no pity
 no friend no hope no kindred weep for me
 almost no grave allow'd me like the lily
 that once was mistress of the field and flourish'd
 i'll hang my head and perish
cardinal wolsey if your grace
 could but be brought to know our ends are honest
 you'ld feel more comfort why should we good lady
 upon what cause wrong you alas our places
 the way of our profession is against it
 we are to cure such sorrows not to sow em
 for goodness sake consider what you do
 how you may hurt yourself ay utterly
 grow from the king's acquaintance by this carriage
 the hearts of princes kiss obedience
 so much they love it but to stubborn spirits
 they swell and grow as terrible as storms
 i know you have a gentle noble temper
 a soul as even as a calm pray think us
 those we profess peacemakers friends and servants
cardinal campeius madam you'll find it so you wrong your virtues
 with these weak women's fears a noble spirit
 as yours was put into you ever casts
 such doubts as false coin from it the king loves you
 beware you lose it not for us if you please
 to trust us in your business we are ready
 to use our utmost studies in your service
queen katharine do what ye will my lords and pray forgive me
 if i have used myself unmannerly
 you know i am a woman lacking wit
 to make a seemly answer to such persons
 pray do my service to his majesty
 he has my heart yet and shall have my prayers
 while i shall have my life come reverend fathers
 bestow your counsels on me she now begs
 that little thought when she set footing here
 she should have bought her dignities so dear
 exeunt
 king henry viii
act iii
scene ii antechamber to king henry viii's apartment
 enter norfolk suffolk surrey and chamberlain
norfolk if you will now unite in your complaints
 and force them with a constancy the cardinal
 cannot stand under them if you omit
 the offer of this time i cannot promise
 but that you shall sustain moe new disgraces
 with these you bear already
surrey i am joyful
 to meet the least occasion that may give me
 remembrance of my fatherinlaw the duke
 to be revenged on him
suffolk which of the peers
 have uncontemn'd gone by him or at least
 strangely neglected when did he regard
 the stamp of nobleness in any person
 out of himself
chamberlain my lords you speak your pleasures
 what he deserves of you and me i know
 what we can do to him though now the time
 gives way to us i much fear if you cannot
 bar his access to the king never attempt
 any thing on him for he hath a witchcraft
 over the king in's tongue
norfolk o fear him not
 his spell in that is out the king hath found
 matter against him that for ever mars
 the honey of his language no he's settled
 not to come off in his displeasure
surrey sir
 i should be glad to hear such news as this
 once every hour
norfolk believe it this is true
 in the divorce his contrary proceedings
 are all unfolded wherein he appears
 as i would wish mine enemy
surrey how came
 his practises to light
suffolk most strangely
surrey o how how
suffolk the cardinal's letters to the pope miscarried
 and came to the eye o the king wherein was read
 how that the cardinal did entreat his holiness
 to stay the judgment o the divorce for if
