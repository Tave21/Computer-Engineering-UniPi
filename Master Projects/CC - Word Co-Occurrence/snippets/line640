 to hazard all our lives in one small boat
 if i today die not with frenchmen's rage
 tomorrow i shall die with mickle age
 by me they nothing gain an if i stay
 tis but the shortening of my life one day
 in thee thy mother dies our household's name
 my death's revenge thy youth and england's fame
 all these and more we hazard by thy stay
 all these are saved if thou wilt fly away
john talbot the sword of orleans hath not made me smart
 these words of yours draw lifeblood from my heart
 on that advantage bought with such a shame
 to save a paltry life and slay bright fame
 before young talbot from old talbot fly
 the coward horse that bears me fail and die
 and like me to the peasant boys of france
 to be shame's scorn and subject of mischance
 surely by all the glory you have won
 an if i fly i am not talbot's son
 then talk no more of flight it is no boot
 if son to talbot die at talbot's foot
talbot then follow thou thy desperate sire of crete
 thou icarus thy life to me is sweet
 if thou wilt fight fight by thy father's side
 and commendable proved let's die in pride

 1 king henry vi
act iv
scene vii another part of the field
 alarum excursions enter talbot led by a servant
talbot where is my other life mine own is gone
 o where's young talbot where is valiant john
 triumphant death smear'd with captivity
 young talbot's valour makes me smile at thee
 when he perceived me shrink and on my knee
 his bloody sword he brandish'd over me
 and like a hungry lion did commence
 rough deeds of rage and stern impatience
 but when my angry guardant stood alone
 tendering my ruin and assail'd of none
 dizzyeyed fury and great rage of heart
 suddenly made him from my side to start
 into the clustering battle of the french
 and in that sea of blood my boy did drench
 his overmounting spirit and there died
 my icarus my blossom in his pride
servant o my dear lord lo where your son is borne
 enter soldiers with the body of john talbot
talbot thou antic death which laugh'st us here to scorn
 anon from thy insulting tyranny
 coupled in bonds of perpetuity
 two talbots winged through the lither sky
 in thy despite shall scape mortality
 o thou whose wounds become hardfavour'd death
 speak to thy father ere thou yield thy breath
 brave death by speaking whether he will or no
 imagine him a frenchman and thy foe
 poor boy he smiles methinks as who should say
 had death been french then death had died today
 come come and lay him in his father's arms
 my spirit can no longer bear these harms
 soldiers adieu i have what i would have
 now my old arms are young john talbot's grave
 dies
 enter charles alencon burgundy bastard of
 orleans joan la pucelle and forces
charles had york and somerset brought rescue in
 we should have found a bloody day of this
bastard of orleans how the young whelp of talbot's ragingwood
 did flesh his puny sword in frenchmen's blood
joan la pucelle once i encounter'd him and thus i said
 thou maiden youth be vanquish'd by a maid'
 but with a proud majestical high scorn
 he answer'd thus young talbot was not born
 to be the pillage of a giglot wench'
 so rushing in the bowels of the french
 he left me proudly as unworthy fight
burgundy doubtless he would have made a noble knight
 see where he lies inhearsed in the arms
 of the most bloody nurser of his harms
bastard of orleans hew them to pieces hack their bones asunder
 whose life was england's glory gallia's wonder
charles o no forbear for that which we have fled
 during the life let us not wrong it dead
 enter sir william lucy attended herald of the
 french preceding
lucy herald conduct me to the dauphin's tent
 to know who hath obtained the glory of the day
charles on what submissive message art thou sent
lucy submission dauphin tis a mere french word
 we english warriors wot not what it means
 i come to know what prisoners thou hast ta'en
 and to survey the bodies of the dead
charles for prisoners ask'st thou hell our prison is
 but tell me whom thou seek'st
lucy but where's the great alcides of the field
 valiant lord talbot earl of shrewsbury
 created for his rare success in arms
 great earl of washford waterford and valence
 lord talbot of goodrig and urchinfield
 lord strange of blackmere lord verdun of alton
 lord cromwell of wingfield lord furnival of sheffield
 the thricevictorious lord of falconbridge
 knight of the noble order of saint george
 worthy saint michael and the golden fleece
 great marshal to henry the sixth
 of all his wars within the realm of france
joan la pucelle here is a silly stately style indeed
 the turk that two and fifty kingdoms hath
 writes not so tedious a style as this
 him that thou magnifiest with all these titles
 stinking and flyblown lies here at our feet
lucy is talbot slain the frenchmen's only scourge
 your kingdom's terror and black nemesis
 o were mine eyeballs into bullets turn'd
 that i in rage might shoot them at your faces
 o that i could but call these dead to life
 it were enough to fright the realm of france
 were but his picture left amongst you here
 it would amaze the proudest of you all
 give me their bodies that i may bear them hence
 and give them burial as beseems their worth
joan la pucelle i think this upstart is old talbot's ghost
 he speaks with such a proud commanding spirit
 for god's sake let him have em to keep them here
 they would but stink and putrefy the air
charles go take their bodies hence
lucy i'll bear them hence but from their ashes shall be rear'd
 a phoenix that shall make all france afeard
charles so we be rid of them do with em what thou wilt
 and now to paris in this conquering vein
 all will be ours now bloody talbot's slain

 enter cardinal of winchester in cardinal's habit

king henry vi my lords ambassadors your several suits
 have been consider'd and debated on
 and therefore are we certainly resolved
 to draw conditions of a friendly peace

 i have inform'd his highness so at large
 as liking of the lady's virtuous gifts

 bear her this jewel pledge of my affection
 and so my lord protector see them guarded
 and safely brought to dover where inshipp'd

 that neither in birth or for authority
