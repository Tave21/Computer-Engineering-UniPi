celia it is as easy to count atomies as to resolve the
 propositions of a lover but take a taste of my
 finding him and relish it with good observance
 i found him under a tree like a dropped acorn
rosalind it may well be called jove's tree when it drops
 forth such fruit
celia give me audience good madam
rosalind proceed
celia there lay he stretched along like a wounded knight
rosalind though it be pity to see such a sight it well
 becomes the ground
celia cry holla to thy tongue i prithee it curvets
 unseasonably he was furnished like a hunter
rosalind o ominous he comes to kill my heart
celia i would sing my song without a burden thou bringest
 me out of tune
rosalind do you not know i am a woman when i think i must
 speak sweet say on
celia you bring me out soft comes he not here
 enter orlando and jaques
rosalind tis he slink by and note him
jaques i thank you for your company but good faith i had
 as lief have been myself alone
orlando and so had i but yet for fashion sake i thank you
 too for your society
jaques god be wi you let's meet as little as we can
orlando i do desire we may be better strangers
jaques i pray you mar no more trees with writing
 lovesongs in their barks
orlando i pray you mar no more of my verses with reading
 them illfavouredly
jaques rosalind is your love's name
orlando yes just
jaques i do not like her name
orlando there was no thought of pleasing you when she was
 christened
jaques what stature is she of
orlando just as high as my heart
jaques you are full of pretty answers have you not been
 acquainted with goldsmiths wives and conned them
 out of rings
orlando not so but i answer you right painted cloth from
 whence you have studied your questions
jaques you have a nimble wit i think twas made of
 atalanta's heels will you sit down with me and
 we two will rail against our mistress the world and
 all our misery
orlando i will chide no breather in the world but myself
 against whom i know most faults
jaques the worst fault you have is to be in love
orlando tis a fault i will not change for your best virtue
 i am weary of you
jaques by my troth i was seeking for a fool when i found
 you
orlando he is drowned in the brook look but in and you
 shall see him
jaques there i shall see mine own figure
orlando which i take to be either a fool or a cipher
jaques i'll tarry no longer with you farewell good
 signior love
orlando i am glad of your departure adieu good monsieur
 melancholy
 exit jaques
rosalind aside to celia i will speak to him like a saucy
 lackey and under that habit play the knave with him
 do you hear forester
orlando very well what would you
rosalind i pray you what is't o'clock
orlando you should ask me what time o day there's no clock
 in the forest
rosalind then there is no true lover in the forest else
 sighing every minute and groaning every hour would
 detect the lazy foot of time as well as a clock
orlando and why not the swift foot of time had not that
 been as proper
rosalind by no means sir time travels in divers paces with
 divers persons i'll tell you who time ambles
 withal who time trots withal who time gallops
 withal and who he stands still withal
orlando i prithee who doth he trot withal
rosalind marry he trots hard with a young maid between the
 contract of her marriage and the day it is
 solemnized if the interim be but a se'nnight
 time's pace is so hard that it seems the length of
 seven year
orlando who ambles time withal
rosalind with a priest that lacks latin and a rich man that
 hath not the gout for the one sleeps easily because
 he cannot study and the other lives merrily because
 he feels no pain the one lacking the burden of lean
 and wasteful learning the other knowing no burden
 of heavy tedious penury these time ambles withal
orlando who doth he gallop withal
rosalind with a thief to the gallows for though he go as
 softly as foot can fall he thinks himself too soon there
orlando who stays it still withal
rosalind with lawyers in the vacation for they sleep between
 term and term and then they perceive not how time moves
orlando where dwell you pretty youth
rosalind with this shepherdess my sister here in the
 skirts of the forest like fringe upon a petticoat
orlando are you native of this place
rosalind as the cony that you see dwell where she is kindled
orlando your accent is something finer than you could
 purchase in so removed a dwelling
rosalind i have been told so of many but indeed an old
 religious uncle of mine taught me to speak who was
 in his youth an inland man one that knew courtship
 too well for there he fell in love i have heard
 him read many lectures against it and i thank god
 i am not a woman to be touched with so many
 giddy offences as he hath generally taxed their
 whole sex withal
orlando can you remember any of the principal evils that he
 laid to the charge of women
rosalind there were none principal they were all like one
 another as halfpence are every one fault seeming
 monstrous till his fellow fault came to match it
orlando i prithee recount some of them
rosalind no i will not cast away my physic but on those that
 are sick there is a man haunts the forest that
 abuses our young plants with carving rosalind on
 their barks hangs odes upon hawthorns and elegies
 on brambles all forsooth deifying the name of
 rosalind if i could meet that fancymonger i would
 give him some good counsel for he seems to have the
 quotidian of love upon him
orlando i am he that is so loveshaked i pray you tell me
 your remedy
rosalind there is none of my uncle's marks upon you he
 taught me how to know a man in love in which cage
 of rushes i am sure you are not prisoner
orlando what were his marks
rosalind a lean cheek which you have not a blue eye and
 sunken which you have not an unquestionable
 spirit which you have not a beard neglected
 which you have not but i pardon you for that for
 simply your having in beard is a younger brother's
 revenue then your hose should be ungartered your
 bonnet unbanded your sleeve unbuttoned your shoe
 untied and every thing about you demonstrating a
 careless desolation but you are no such man you
 are rather pointdevice in your accoutrements as
 loving yourself than seeming the lover of any other
orlando fair youth i would i could make thee believe i love
rosalind me believe it you may as soon make her that you
 love believe it which i warrant she is apter to
 do than to confess she does that is one of the
 points in the which women still give the lie to
 their consciences but in good sooth are you he
 that hangs the verses on the trees wherein rosalind
 is so admired
orlando i swear to thee youth by the white hand of
 rosalind i am that he that unfortunate he
rosalind but are you so much in love as your rhymes speak
orlando neither rhyme nor reason can express how much
rosalind love is merely a madness and i tell you deserves
 as well a dark house and a whip as madmen do and
 the reason why they are not so punished and cured
 is that the lunacy is so ordinary that the whippers
 are in love too yet i profess curing it by counsel
orlando did you ever cure any so
rosalind yes one and in this manner he was to imagine me
 his love his mistress and i set him every day to
 woo me at which time would i being but a moonish
 youth grieve be effeminate changeable longing
 and liking proud fantastical apish shallow
 inconstant full of tears full of smiles for every
 passion something and for no passion truly any
 thing as boys and women are for the most part
 cattle of this colour would now like him now loathe
 him then entertain him then forswear him now weep
 for him then spit at him that i drave my suitor
 from his mad humour of love to a living humour of
 madness which was to forswear the full stream of
 the world and to live in a nook merely monastic
 and thus i cured him and this way will i take upon
 me to wash your liver as clean as a sound sheep's
 heart that there shall not be one spot of love in't
orlando i would not be cured youth
rosalind i would cure you if you would but call me rosalind
 and come every day to my cote and woo me
orlando now by the faith of my love i will tell me
 where it is
rosalind go with me to it and i'll show it you and by the way
 you shall tell me where in the forest you live
 will you go
orlando with all my heart good youth
rosalind nay you must call me rosalind come sister will you go
 exeunt
 as you like it
