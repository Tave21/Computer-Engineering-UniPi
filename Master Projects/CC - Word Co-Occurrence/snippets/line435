biron this fellow pecks up wit as pigeons pease
 and utters it again when god doth please
 he is wit's pedler and retails his wares
 at wakes and wassails meetings markets fairs
 and we that sell by gross the lord doth know
 have not the grace to grace it with such show
 this gallant pins the wenches on his sleeve
 had he been adam he had tempted eve
 a can carve too and lisp why this is he
 that kiss'd his hand away in courtesy
 this is the ape of form monsieur the nice
 that when he plays at tables chides the dice
 in honourable terms nay he can sing
 a mean most meanly and in ushering
 mend him who can the ladies call him sweet
 the stairs as he treads on them kiss his feet
 this is the flower that smiles on every one
 to show his teeth as white as whale's bone
 and consciences that will not die in debt
 pay him the due of honeytongued boyet
ferdinand a blister on his sweet tongue with my heart
 that put armado's page out of his part
biron see where it comes behavior what wert thou
 till this madman show'd thee and what art thou now
 reenter the princess ushered by boyet rosaline
 maria and katharine
ferdinand all hail sweet madam and fair time of day
princess fair in all hail is foul as i conceive
ferdinand construe my speeches better if you may
princess then wish me better i will give you leave
ferdinand we came to visit you and purpose now
 to lead you to our court vouchsafe it then
princess this field shall hold me and so hold your vow
 nor god nor i delights in perjured men
ferdinand rebuke me not for that which you provoke
 the virtue of your eye must break my oath
princess you nickname virtue vice you should have spoke
 for virtue's office never breaks men's troth
 now by my maiden honour yet as pure
 as the unsullied lily i protest
 a world of torments though i should endure
 i would not yield to be your house's guest
 so much i hate a breaking cause to be
 of heavenly oaths vow'd with integrity
ferdinand o you have lived in desolation here
 unseen unvisited much to our shame
princess not so my lord it is not so i swear
 we have had pastimes here and pleasant game
 a mess of russians left us but of late
ferdinand how madam russians
princess ay in truth my lord
 trim gallants full of courtship and of state
rosaline madam speak true it is not so my lord
 my lady to the manner of the days
 in courtesy gives undeserving praise
 we four indeed confronted were with four
 in russian habit here they stay'd an hour
 and talk'd apace and in that hour my lord
 they did not bless us with one happy word
 i dare not call them fools but this i think
 when they are thirsty fools would fain have drink
biron this jest is dry to me fair gentle sweet
 your wit makes wise things foolish when we greet
 with eyes best seeing heaven's fiery eye
 by light we lose light your capacity
 is of that nature that to your huge store
 wise things seem foolish and rich things but poor
rosaline this proves you wise and rich for in my eye
biron i am a fool and full of poverty
rosaline but that you take what doth to you belong
 it were a fault to snatch words from my tongue
biron o i am yours and all that i possess
rosaline all the fool mine
biron i cannot give you less
rosaline which of the vizards was it that you wore
biron where when what vizard why demand you this
rosaline there then that vizard that superfluous case
 that hid the worse and show'd the better face
ferdinand we are descried they'll mock us now downright
dumain let us confess and turn it to a jest
princess amazed my lord why looks your highness sad
rosaline help hold his brows he'll swoon why look you pale
 seasick i think coming from muscovy
biron thus pour the stars down plagues for perjury
 can any face of brass hold longer out
 here stand i lady dart thy skill at me
 bruise me with scorn confound me with a flout
 thrust thy sharp wit quite through my ignorance
 cut me to pieces with thy keen conceit
 and i will wish thee never more to dance
 nor never more in russian habit wait
 o never will i trust to speeches penn'd
 nor to the motion of a schoolboy's tongue
 nor never come in vizard to my friend
 nor woo in rhyme like a blind harper's song
 taffeta phrases silken terms precise
 threepiled hyperboles spruce affectation
 figures pedantical these summerflies
 have blown me full of maggot ostentation
 i do forswear them and i here protest
 by this white glovehow white the hand god knows
 henceforth my wooing mind shall be express'd
 in russet yeas and honest kersey noes
 and to begin wenchso god help me la
 my love to thee is sound sans crack or flaw
rosaline sans sans i pray you
biron yet i have a trick
 of the old rage bear with me i am sick
 i'll leave it by degrees soft let us see
 write lord have mercy on us on those three
 they are infected in their hearts it lies
 they have the plague and caught it of your eyes
 these lords are visited you are not free
 for the lord's tokens on you do i see
princess no they are free that gave these tokens to us
biron our states are forfeit seek not to undo us
rosaline it is not so for how can this be true
 that you stand forfeit being those that sue
biron peace for i will not have to do with you
rosaline nor shall not if i do as i intend
biron speak for yourselves my wit is at an end
ferdinand teach us sweet madam for our rude transgression
 some fair excuse
princess the fairest is confession
 were not you here but even now disguised
ferdinand madam i was
princess and were you well advised
ferdinand i was fair madam
princess when you then were here
 what did you whisper in your lady's ear
ferdinand that more than all the world i did respect her
princess when she shall challenge this you will reject her
ferdinand upon mine honour no
princess peace peace forbear
 your oath once broke you force not to forswear
ferdinand despise me when i break this oath of mine
princess i will and therefore keep it rosaline
 what did the russian whisper in your ear
rosaline madam he swore that he did hold me dear
 as precious eyesight and did value me
 above this world adding thereto moreover
 that he would wed me or else die my lover
princess god give thee joy of him the noble lord
 most honourably doth unhold his word
ferdinand what mean you madam by my life my troth
 i never swore this lady such an oath
rosaline by heaven you did and to confirm it plain
 you gave me this but take it sir again
ferdinand my faith and this the princess i did give
 i knew her by this jewel on her sleeve
princess pardon me sir this jewel did she wear
 and lord biron i thank him is my dear
 what will you have me or your pearl again
biron neither of either i remit both twain
 i see the trick on't here was a consent
 knowing aforehand of our merriment
 to dash it like a christmas comedy
 some carrytale some pleaseman some slight zany
 some mumblenews some trencherknight some dick
 that smiles his cheek in years and knows the trick
 to make my lady laugh when she's disposed
 told our intents before which once disclosed
 the ladies did change favours and then we
 following the signs woo'd but the sign of she
 now to our perjury to add more terror
 we are again forsworn in will and error
 much upon this it is and might not you
 to boyet
 forestall our sport to make us thus untrue
 do not you know my lady's foot by the squier
 and laugh upon the apple of her eye
 and stand between her back sir and the fire
 holding a trencher jesting merrily
 you put our page out go you are allow'd
 die when you will a smock shall be your shroud
 you leer upon me do you there's an eye
 wounds like a leaden sword
boyet full merrily
 hath this brave manage this career been run
biron lo he is tilting straight peace i have done
 enter costard
 welcome pure wit thou partest a fair fray
costard o lord sir they would know
 whether the three worthies shall come in or no
biron what are there but three
costard no sir but it is vara fine
 for every one pursents three
biron and three times thrice is nine
costard not so sir under correction sir i hope it is not so
 you cannot beg us sir i can assure you sir we know
 what we know
 i hope sir three times thrice sir
biron is not nine
costard under correction sir we know whereuntil it doth amount
biron by jove i always took three threes for nine
costard o lord sir it were pity you should get your living
 by reckoning sir
biron how much is it
costard o lord sir the parties themselves the actors
 sir will show whereuntil it doth amount for mine
