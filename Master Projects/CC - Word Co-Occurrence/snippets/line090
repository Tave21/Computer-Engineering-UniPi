that sendeth ambassadors by the sea even in vessels of bulrushes upon the waters saying go ye swift messengers to a nation scattered and peeled to a people terrible from their beginning hitherto a nation meted out and trodden down whose land the rivers have spoiled
all ye inhabitants of the world and dwellers on the earth see ye when he lifteth up an ensign on the mountains and when he bloweth a trumpet hear ye
for so the lord said unto me i will take my rest and i will consider in my dwelling place like a clear heat upon herbs and like a cloud of dew in the heat of harvest
for afore the harvest when the bud is perfect and the sour grape is ripening in the flower he shall both cut off the sprigs with pruning hooks and take away and cut down the branches
they shall be left together unto the fowls of the mountains and to the beasts of the earth and the fowls shall summer upon them and all the beasts of the earth shall winter upon them
in that time shall the present be brought unto the lord of hosts of a people scattered and peeled and from a people terrible from their beginning hitherto a nation meted out and trodden under foot whose land the rivers have spoiled to the place of the name of the lord of hosts the mount zion

and the spirit of egypt shall fail in the midst thereof and i will destroy the counsel thereof and they shall seek to the idols and to the charmers and to them that have familiar spirits and to the wizards
and the egyptians will i give over into the hand of a cruel lord and a fierce king shall rule over them saith the lord the lord of hosts
and the waters shall fail from the sea and the river shall be wasted and dried up
and they shall turn the rivers far away and the brooks of defence shall be emptied and dried up the reeds and flags shall wither
the paper reeds by the brooks by the mouth of the brooks and every thing sown by the brooks shall wither be driven away and be no more
the fishers also shall mourn and all they that cast angle into the brooks shall lament and they that spread nets upon the waters shall languish

and they shall be broken in the purposes thereof all that make sluices and ponds for fish

and it shall be for a sign and for a witness unto the lord of hosts in the land of egypt for they shall cry unto the lord because of the oppressors and he shall send them a saviour and a great one and he shall deliver them

and the lord shall smite egypt he shall smite and heal it and they shall return even to the lord and he shall be intreated of them and shall heal them
in that day shall there be a highway out of egypt to assyria and the assyrian shall come into egypt and the egyptian into assyria and the egyptians shall serve with the assyrians

and they shall be afraid and ashamed of ethiopia their expectation and of egypt their glory
and the inhabitant of this isle shall say in that day behold such is our expectation whither we flee for help to be delivered from the king of assyria and how shall we escape

and the key of the house of david will i lay upon his shoulder so he shall open and none shall shut and he shall shut and none shall open

and they shall be gathered together as prisoners are gathered in the pit and shall be shut up in the prison and after many days shall they be visited
then the moon shall be confounded and the sun ashamed when the lord of hosts shall reign in mount zion and in jerusalem and before his ancients gloriously

for behold the lord cometh out of his place to punish the inhabitants of the earth for their iniquity the earth also shall disclose her blood and shall no more cover her slain

and it shall come to pass in that day that the lord shall beat off from the channel of the river unto the stream of egypt and ye shall be gathered one by one o ye children of israel
and it shall come to pass in that day that the great trumpet shall be blown and they shall come which were ready to perish in the land of assyria and the outcasts in the land of egypt and shall worship the lord in the holy mount at jerusalem

behold the lord hath a mighty and strong one which as a tempest of hail and a destroying storm as a flood of mighty waters overflowing shall cast down to the earth with the hand
the crown of pride the drunkards of ephraim shall be trodden under feet
and the glorious beauty which is on the head of the fat valley shall be a fading flower and as the hasty fruit before the summer which when he that looketh upon it seeth while it is yet in his hand he eateth it up
in that day shall the lord of hosts be for a crown of glory and for a diadem of beauty unto the residue of his people
and for a spirit of judgment to him that sitteth in judgment and for strength to them that turn the battle to the gate
but they also have erred through wine and through strong drink are out of the way the priest and the prophet have erred through strong drink they are swallowed up of wine they are out of the way through strong drink they err in vision they stumble in judgment
for all tables are full of vomit and filthiness so that there is no place clean
whom shall he teach knowledge and whom shall he make to understand doctrine them that are weaned from the milk and drawn from the breasts
for precept must be upon precept precept upon precept line upon line line upon line here a little and there a little
for with stammering lips and another tongue will he speak to this people
to whom he said this is the rest wherewith ye may cause the weary to rest and this is the refreshing yet they would not hear
but the word of the lord was unto them precept upon precept precept upon precept line upon line line upon line here a little and there a little that they might go and fall backward and be broken and snared and taken
wherefore hear the word of the lord ye scornful men that rule this people which is in jerusalem
because ye have said we have made a covenant with death and with hell are we at agreement when the overflowing scourge shall pass through it shall not come unto us for we have made lies our refuge and under falsehood have we hid ourselves
therefore thus saith the lord god behold i lay in zion for a foundation a stone a tried stone a precious corner stone a sure foundation he that believeth shall not make haste
judgment also will i lay to the line and righteousness to the plummet and the hail shall sweep away the refuge of lies and the waters shall overflow the hiding place
and your covenant with death shall be disannulled and your agreement with hell shall not stand when the overflowing scourge shall pass through then ye shall be trodden down by it
from the time that it goeth forth it shall take you for morning by morning shall it pass over by day and by night and it shall be a vexation only to understand the report
for the bed is shorter than that a man can stretch himself on it and the covering narrower than that he can wrap himself in it
for the lord shall rise up as in mount perazim he shall be wroth as in the valley of gibeon that he may do his work his strange work and bring to pass his act his strange act
now therefore be ye not mockers lest your bands be made strong for i have heard from the lord god of hosts a consumption even determined upon the whole earth
give ye ear and hear my voice hearken and hear my speech
doth the plowman plow all day to sow doth he open and break the clods of his ground
when he hath made plain the face thereof doth he not cast abroad the fitches and scatter the cummin and cast in the principal wheat and the appointed barley and the rie in their place
for his god doth instruct him to discretion and doth teach him
for the fitches are not threshed with a threshing instrument neither is a cart wheel turned about upon the cummin but the fitches are beaten out with a staff and the cummin with a rod
bread corn is bruised because he will not ever be threshing it nor break it with the wheel of his cart nor bruise it with his horsemen
this also cometh forth from the lord of hosts which is wonderful in counsel and excellent in working
woe to ariel to ariel the city where david dwelt add ye year to year let them kill sacrifices
yet i will distress ariel and there shall be heaviness and sorrow and it shall be unto me as ariel
and i will camp against thee round about and will lay siege against thee with a mount and i will raise forts against thee
and thou shalt be brought down and shalt speak out of the ground and thy speech shall be low out of the dust and thy voice shall be as of one that hath a familiar spirit out of the ground and thy speech shall whisper out of the dust
