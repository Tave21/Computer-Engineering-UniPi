queen gertrude i will not speak with her
gentleman she is importunate indeed distract
 her mood will needs be pitied
queen gertrude what would she have
gentleman she speaks much of her father says she hears
 there's tricks i the world and hems and beats her heart
 spurns enviously at straws speaks things in doubt
 that carry but half sense her speech is nothing
 yet the unshaped use of it doth move
 the hearers to collection they aim at it
 and botch the words up fit to their own thoughts
 which as her winks and nods and gestures
 yield them
 indeed would make one think there might be thought
 though nothing sure yet much unhappily
horatio twere good she were spoken with for she may strew
 dangerous conjectures in illbreeding minds
queen gertrude let her come in
 exit horatio
 to my sick soul as sin's true nature is
 each toy seems prologue to some great amiss
 so full of artless jealousy is guilt
 it spills itself in fearing to be spilt
 reenter horatio with ophelia
ophelia where is the beauteous majesty of denmark
queen gertrude how now ophelia
ophelia sings
 how should i your true love know
 from another one
 by his cockle hat and staff
 and his sandal shoon
queen gertrude alas sweet lady what imports this song
ophelia say you nay pray you mark
 sings
 he is dead and gone lady
 he is dead and gone
 at his head a grassgreen turf
 at his heels a stone
queen gertrude nay but ophelia
ophelia pray you mark
 sings
 white his shroud as the mountain snow
 enter king claudius
queen gertrude alas look here my lord
ophelia sings
 larded with sweet flowers
 which bewept to the grave did go
 with truelove showers
king claudius how do you pretty lady
ophelia well god ild you they say the owl was a baker's
 daughter lord we know what we are but know not
 what we may be god be at your table
king claudius conceit upon her father
ophelia pray you let's have no words of this but when they
 ask you what it means say you this
 sings
 tomorrow is saint valentine's day
 all in the morning betime
 and i a maid at your window
 to be your valentine
 then up he rose and donn'd his clothes
 and dupp'd the chamberdoor
 let in the maid that out a maid
 never departed more
king claudius pretty ophelia
ophelia indeed la without an oath i'll make an end on't
 sings
 by gis and by saint charity
 alack and fie for shame
 young men will do't if they come to't
 by cock they are to blame
 quoth she before you tumbled me
 you promised me to wed
 so would i ha done by yonder sun
 an thou hadst not come to my bed
king claudius how long hath she been thus
ophelia i hope all will be well we must be patient but i
 cannot choose but weep to think they should lay him
 i the cold ground my brother shall know of it
 and so i thank you for your good counsel come my
 coach good night ladies good night sweet ladies
 good night good night
 exit
king claudius follow her close give her good watch
 i pray you
 exit horatio
 o this is the poison of deep grief it springs
 all from her father's death o gertrude gertrude
 when sorrows come they come not single spies
 but in battalions first her father slain
 next your son gone and he most violent author
 of his own just remove the people muddied
 thick and unwholesome in their thoughts and whispers
 for good polonius death and we have done but greenly
 in huggermugger to inter him poor ophelia
 divided from herself and her fair judgment
 without the which we are pictures or mere beasts
 last and as much containing as all these
 her brother is in secret come from france
 feeds on his wonder keeps himself in clouds
 and wants not buzzers to infect his ear
 with pestilent speeches of his father's death
 wherein necessity of matter beggar'd
 will nothing stick our person to arraign
 in ear and ear o my dear gertrude this
 like to a murderingpiece in many places
 gives me superfluous death
 a noise within
queen gertrude alack what noise is this
king claudius where are my switzers let them guard the door
 enter another gentleman
 what is the matter
gentleman save yourself my lord
 the ocean overpeering of his list
 eats not the flats with more impetuous haste
 than young laertes in a riotous head
 o'erbears your officers the rabble call him lord
 and as the world were now but to begin
 antiquity forgot custom not known
 the ratifiers and props of every word
 they cry choose we laertes shall be king'
 caps hands and tongues applaud it to the clouds
 laertes shall be king laertes king'
queen gertrude how cheerfully on the false trail they cry
 o this is counter you false danish dogs
king claudius the doors are broke
 noise within
 enter laertes armed danes following
laertes where is this king sirs stand you all without
danes no let's come in
laertes i pray you give me leave
danes we will we will
 they retire without the door
laertes i thank you keep the door o thou vile king
 give me my father
queen gertrude calmly good laertes
laertes that drop of blood that's calm proclaims me bastard
 cries cuckold to my father brands the harlot
 even here between the chaste unsmirched brow
 of my true mother
king claudius what is the cause laertes
 that thy rebellion looks so giantlike
 let him go gertrude do not fear our person
 there's such divinity doth hedge a king
 that treason can but peep to what it would
 acts little of his will tell me laertes
 why thou art thus incensed let him go gertrude
 speak man
laertes where is my father
king claudius dead
queen gertrude but not by him
king claudius let him demand his fill
laertes how came he dead i'll not be juggled with
 to hell allegiance vows to the blackest devil
 conscience and grace to the profoundest pit
 i dare damnation to this point i stand
 that both the worlds i give to negligence
 let come what comes only i'll be revenged
 most thoroughly for my father
king claudius who shall stay you
laertes my will not all the world
 and for my means i'll husband them so well
 they shall go far with little
king claudius good laertes
 if you desire to know the certainty
 of your dear father's death is't writ in your revenge
 that swoopstake you will draw both friend and foe
 winner and loser
laertes none but his enemies
king claudius will you know them then
laertes to his good friends thus wide i'll ope my arms
 and like the kind liferendering pelican
 repast them with my blood
king claudius why now you speak
 like a good child and a true gentleman
 that i am guiltless of your father's death
 and am most sensible in grief for it
 it shall as level to your judgment pierce
 as day does to your eye
danes within let her come in
laertes how now what noise is that
 reenter ophelia
 o heat dry up my brains tears seven times salt
 burn out the sense and virtue of mine eye
 by heaven thy madness shall be paid by weight
 till our scale turn the beam o rose of may
 dear maid kind sister sweet ophelia
 o heavens is't possible a young maid's wits
 should be as moral as an old man's life
 nature is fine in love and where tis fine
 it sends some precious instance of itself
 after the thing it loves
ophelia sings
 they bore him barefaced on the bier
 hey non nonny nonny hey nonny
 and in his grave rain'd many a tear
 fare you well my dove
laertes hadst thou thy wits and didst persuade revenge
 it could not move thus
ophelia sings
