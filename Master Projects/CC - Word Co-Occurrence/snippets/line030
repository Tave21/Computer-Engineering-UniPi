so joshua sent messengers and they ran unto the tent and behold it was hid in his tent and the silver under it
and they took them out of the midst of the tent and brought them unto joshua and unto all the children of israel and laid them out before the lord
and joshua and all israel with him took achan the son of zerah and the silver and the garment and the wedge of gold and his sons and his daughters and his oxen and his asses and his sheep and his tent and all that he had and they brought them unto the valley of achor
and joshua said why hast thou troubled us the lord shall trouble thee this day and all israel stoned him with stones and burned them with fire after they had stoned them with stones
and they raised over him a great heap of stones unto this day so the lord turned from the fierceness of his anger wherefore the name of that place was called the valley of achor unto this day
and the lord said unto joshua fear not neither be thou dismayed take all the people of war with thee and arise go up to ai see i have given into thy hand the king of ai and his people and his city and his land
and thou shalt do to ai and her king as thou didst unto jericho and her king only the spoil thereof and the cattle thereof shall ye take for a prey unto yourselves lay thee an ambush for the city behind it
so joshua arose and all the people of war to go up against ai and joshua chose out thirty thousand mighty men of valour and sent them away by night
and he commanded them saying behold ye shall lie in wait against the city even behind the city go not very far from the city but be ye all ready
and i and all the people that are with me will approach unto the city and it shall come to pass when they come out against us as at the first that we will flee before them
for they will come out after us till we have drawn them from the city for they will say they flee before us as at the first therefore we will flee before them
then ye shall rise up from the ambush and seize upon the city for the lord your god will deliver it into your hand
and it shall be when ye have taken the city that ye shall set the city on fire according to the commandment of the lord shall ye do see i have commanded you
joshua therefore sent them forth and they went to lie in ambush and abode between bethel and ai on the west side of ai but joshua lodged that night among the people
and joshua rose up early in the morning and numbered the people and went up he and the elders of israel before the people to ai
and all the people even the people of war that were with him went up and drew nigh and came before the city and pitched on the north side of ai now there was a valley between them and ai
and he took about five thousand men and set them to lie in ambush between bethel and ai on the west side of the city
and when they had set the people even all the host that was on the north of the city and their liers in wait on the west of the city joshua went that night into the midst of the valley
and it came to pass when the king of ai saw it that they hasted and rose up early and the men of the city went out against israel to battle he and all his people at a time appointed before the plain but he wist not that there were liers in ambush against him behind the city
and joshua and all israel made as if they were beaten before them and fled by the way of the wilderness
and all the people that were in ai were called together to pursue after them and they pursued after joshua and were drawn away from the city
and there was not a man left in ai or bethel that went not out after israel and they left the city open and pursued after israel
and the lord said unto joshua stretch out the spear that is in thy hand toward ai for i will give it into thine hand and joshua stretched out the spear that he had in his hand toward the city
and the ambush arose quickly out of their place and they ran as soon as he had stretched out his hand and they entered into the city and took it and hasted and set the city on fire
and when the men of ai looked behind them they saw and behold the smoke of the city ascended up to heaven and they had no power to flee this way or that way and the people that fled to the wilderness turned back upon the pursuers
and when joshua and all israel saw that the ambush had taken the city and that the smoke of the city ascended then they turned again and slew the men of ai
and the other issued out of the city against them so they were in the midst of israel some on this side and some on that side and they smote them so that they let none of them remain or escape
and the king of ai they took alive and brought him to joshua
and it came to pass when israel had made an end of slaying all the inhabitants of ai in the field in the wilderness wherein they chased them and when they were all fallen on the edge of the sword until they were consumed that all the israelites returned unto ai and smote it with the edge of the sword
and so it was that all that fell that day both of men and women were twelve thousand even all the men of ai
for joshua drew not his hand back wherewith he stretched out the spear until he had utterly destroyed all the inhabitants of ai
only the cattle and the spoil of that city israel took for a prey unto themselves according unto the word of the lord which he commanded joshua
and joshua burnt ai and made it an heap for ever even a desolation unto this day
and the king of ai he hanged on a tree until eventide and as soon as the sun was down joshua commanded that they should take his carcase down from the tree and cast it at the entering of the gate of the city and raise thereon a great heap of stones that remaineth unto this day
then joshua built an altar unto the lord god of israel in mount ebal
as moses the servant of the lord commanded the children of israel as it is written in the book of the law of moses an altar of whole stones over which no man hath lift up any iron and they offered thereon burnt offerings unto the lord and sacrificed peace offerings
and he wrote there upon the stones a copy of the law of moses which he wrote in the presence of the children of israel
and all israel and their elders and officers and their judges stood on this side the ark and on that side before the priests the levites which bare the ark of the covenant of the lord as well the stranger as he that was born among them half of them over against mount gerizim and half of them over against mount ebal as moses the servant of the lord had commanded before that they should bless the people of israel
and afterward he read all the words of the law the blessings and cursings according to all that is written in the book of the law
there was not a word of all that moses commanded which joshua read not before all the congregation of israel with the women and the little ones and the strangers that were conversant among them
and it came to pass when all the kings which were on this side jordan in the hills and in the valleys and in all the coasts of the great sea over against lebanon the hittite and the amorite the canaanite the perizzite the hivite and the jebusite heard thereof
that they gathered themselves together to fight with joshua and with israel with one accord
and when the inhabitants of gibeon heard what joshua had done unto jericho and to ai
they did work wilily and went and made as if they had been ambassadors and took old sacks upon their asses and wine bottles old and rent and bound up
and old shoes and clouted upon their feet and old garments upon them and all the bread of their provision was dry and mouldy
and they went to joshua unto the camp at gilgal and said unto him and to the men of israel we be come from a far country now therefore make ye a league with us
and the men of israel said unto the hivites peradventure ye dwell among us and how shall we make a league with you
and they said unto joshua we are thy servants and joshua said unto them who are ye and from whence come ye
and they said unto him from a very far country thy servants are come because of the name of the lord thy god for we have heard the fame of him and all that he did in egypt
and all that he did to the two kings of the amorites that were beyond jordan to sihon king of heshbon and to og king of bashan which was at ashtaroth
wherefore our elders and all the inhabitants of our country spake to us saying take victuals with you for the journey and go to meet them and say unto them we are your servants therefore now make ye a league with us
this our bread we took hot for our provision out of our houses on the day we came forth to go unto you but now behold it is dry and it is mouldy
and these bottles of wine which we filled were new and behold they be rent and these our garments and our shoes are become old by reason of the very long journey
and the men took of their victuals and asked not counsel at the mouth of the lord
and joshua made peace with them and made a league with them to let them live and the princes of the congregation sware unto them
and it came to pass at the end of three days after they had made a league with them that they heard that they were their neighbours and that they dwelt among them
and the children of israel journeyed and came unto their cities on the third day now their cities were gibeon and chephirah and beeroth and kirjathjearim
and the children of israel smote them not because the princes of the congregation had sworn unto them by the lord god of israel and all the congregation murmured against the princes
but all the princes said unto all the congregation we have sworn unto them by the lord god of israel now therefore we may not touch them
this we will do to them we will even let them live lest wrath be upon us because of the oath which we sware unto them
and the princes said unto them let them live but let them be hewers of wood and drawers of water unto all the congregation as the princes had promised them
and joshua called for them and he spake unto them saying wherefore have ye beguiled us saying we are very far from you when ye dwell among us
now therefore ye are cursed and there shall none of you be freed from being bondmen and hewers of wood and drawers of water for the house of my god
and they answered joshua and said because it was certainly told thy servants how that the lord thy god commanded his servant moses to give you all the land and to destroy all the inhabitants of the land from before you therefore we were sore afraid of our lives because of you and have done this thing
and now behold we are in thine hand as it seemeth good and right unto thee to do unto us do
and so did he unto them and delivered them out of the hand of the children of israel that they slew them not
and joshua made them that day hewers of wood and drawers of water for the congregation and for the altar of the lord even unto this day in the place which he should choose
now it came to pass when adonizedec king of jerusalem had heard how joshua had taken ai and had utterly destroyed it as he had done to jericho and her king so he had done to ai and her king and how the inhabitants of gibeon had made peace with israel and were among them
that they feared greatly because gibeon was a great city as one of the royal cities and because it was greater than ai and all the men thereof were mighty
wherefore adonizedec king of jerusalem sent unto hoham king of hebron and unto piram king of jarmuth and unto japhia king of lachish and unto debir king of eglon saying
come up unto me and help me that we may smite gibeon for it hath made peace with joshua and with the children of israel
therefore the five kings of the amorites the king of jerusalem the king of hebron the king of jarmuth the king of lachish the king of eglon gathered themselves together and went up they and all their hosts and encamped before gibeon and made war against it
and the men of gibeon sent unto joshua to the camp to gilgal saying slack not thy hand from thy servants come up to us quickly and save us and help us for all the kings of the amorites that dwell in the mountains are gathered together against us
so joshua ascended from gilgal he and all the people of war with him and all the mighty men of valour
and the lord said unto joshua fear them not for i have delivered them into thine hand there shall not a man of them stand before thee
joshua therefore came unto them suddenly and went up from gilgal all night
and the lord discomfited them before israel and slew them with a great slaughter at gibeon and chased them along the way that goeth up to bethhoron and smote them to azekah and unto makkedah
and it came to pass as they fled from before israel and were in the going down to bethhoron that the lord cast down great stones from heaven upon them unto azekah and they died they were more which died with hailstones than they whom the children of israel slew with the sword
then spake joshua to the lord in the day when the lord delivered up the amorites before the children of israel and he said in the sight of israel sun stand thou still upon gibeon and thou moon in the valley of ajalon
and the sun stood still and the moon stayed until the people had avenged themselves upon their enemies is not this written in the book of jasher so the sun stood still in the midst of heaven and hasted not to go down about a whole day
and there was no day like that before it or after it that the lord hearkened unto the voice of a man for the lord fought for israel
and joshua returned and all israel with him unto the camp to gilgal
but these five kings fled and hid themselves in a cave at makkedah
and it was told joshua saying the five kings are found hid in a cave at makkedah
and joshua said roll great stones upon the mouth of the cave and set men by it for to keep them
and stay ye not but pursue after your enemies and smite the hindmost of them suffer them not to enter into their cities for the lord your god hath delivered them into your hand
and it came to pass when joshua and the children of israel had made an end of slaying them with a very great slaughter till they were consumed that the rest which remained of them entered into fenced cities
and all the people returned to the camp to joshua at makkedah in peace none moved his tongue against any of the children of israel
then said joshua open the mouth of the cave and bring out those five kings unto me out of the cave
and they did so and brought forth those five kings unto him out of the cave the king of jerusalem the king of hebron the king of jarmuth the king of lachish and the king of eglon
and it came to pass when they brought out those kings unto joshua that joshua called for all the men of israel and said unto the captains of the men of war which went with him come near put your feet upon the necks of these kings and they came near and put their feet upon the necks of them
and joshua said unto them fear not nor be dismayed be strong and of good courage for thus shall the lord do to all your enemies against whom ye fight
and afterward joshua smote them and slew them and hanged them on five trees and they were hanging upon the trees until the evening
and it came to pass at the time of the going down of the sun that joshua commanded and they took them down off the trees and cast them into the cave wherein they had been hid and laid great stones in the cave's mouth which remain until this very day
and that day joshua took makkedah and smote it with the edge of the sword and the king thereof he utterly destroyed them and all the souls that were therein he let none remain and he did to the king of makkedah as he did unto the king of jericho
then joshua passed from makkedah and all israel with him unto libnah and fought against libnah
and the lord delivered it also and the king thereof into the hand of israel and he smote it with the edge of the sword and all the souls that were therein he let none remain in it but did unto the king thereof as he did unto the king of jericho
and joshua passed from libnah and all israel with him unto lachish and encamped against it and fought against it
and the lord delivered lachish into the hand of israel which took it on the second day and smote it with the edge of the sword and all the souls that were therein according to all that he had done to libnah
then horam king of gezer came up to help lachish and joshua smote him and his people until he had left him none remaining
and from lachish joshua passed unto eglon and all israel with him and they encamped against it and fought against it
and they took it on that day and smote it with the edge of the sword and all the souls that were therein he utterly destroyed that day according to all that he had done to lachish
and joshua went up from eglon and all israel with him unto hebron and they fought against it
and they took it and smote it with the edge of the sword and the king thereof and all the cities thereof and all the souls that were therein he left none remaining according to all that he had done to eglon but destroyed it utterly and all the souls that were therein
and joshua returned and all israel with him to debir and fought against it
and he took it and the king thereof and all the cities thereof and they smote them with the edge of the sword and utterly destroyed all the souls that were therein he left none remaining as he had done to hebron so he did to debir and to the king thereof as he had done also to libnah and to her king
so joshua smote all the country of the hills and of the south and of the vale and of the springs and all their kings he left none remaining but utterly destroyed all that breathed as the lord god of israel commanded
and joshua smote them from kadeshbarnea even unto gaza and all the country of goshen even unto gibeon
and all these kings and their land did joshua take at one time because the lord god of israel fought for israel
and joshua returned and all israel with him unto the camp to gilgal
and it came to pass when jabin king of hazor had heard those things that he sent to jobab king of madon and to the king of shimron and to the king of achshaph
and to the kings that were on the north of the mountains and of the plains south of chinneroth and in the valley and in the borders of dor on the west
and to the canaanite on the east and on the west and to the amorite and the hittite and the perizzite and the jebusite in the mountains and to the hivite under hermon in the land of mizpeh
and they went out they and all their hosts with them much people even as the sand that is upon the sea shore in multitude with horses and chariots very many
and when all these kings were met together they came and pitched together at the waters of merom to fight against israel
and the lord said unto joshua be not afraid because of them for to morrow about this time will i deliver them up all slain before israel thou shalt hough their horses and burn their chariots with fire
so joshua came and all the people of war with him against them by the waters of merom suddenly and they fell upon them
and the lord delivered them into the hand of israel who smote them and chased them unto great zidon and unto misrephothmaim and unto the valley of mizpeh eastward and they smote them until they left them none remaining
and joshua did unto them as the lord bade him he houghed their horses and burnt their chariots with fire
and joshua at that time turned back and took hazor and smote the king thereof with the sword for hazor beforetime was the head of all those kingdoms
and they smote all the souls that were therein with the edge of the sword utterly destroying them there was not any left to breathe and he burnt hazor with fire
and all the cities of those kings and all the kings of them did joshua take and smote them with the edge of the sword and he utterly destroyed them as moses the servant of the lord commanded
but as for the cities that stood still in their strength israel burned none of them save hazor only that did joshua burn
and all the spoil of these cities and the cattle the children of israel took for a prey unto themselves but every man they smote with the edge of the sword until they had destroyed them neither left they any to breathe
as the lord commanded moses his servant so did moses command joshua and so did joshua he left nothing undone of all that the lord commanded moses
so joshua took all that land the hills and all the south country and all the land of goshen and the valley and the plain and the mountain of israel and the valley of the same
even from the mount halak that goeth up to seir even unto baalgad in the valley of lebanon under mount hermon and all their kings he took and smote them and slew them
joshua made war a long time with all those kings
there was not a city that made peace with the children of israel save the hivites the inhabitants of gibeon all other they took in battle
for it was of the lord to harden their hearts that they should come against israel in battle that he might destroy them utterly and that they might have no favour but that he might destroy them as the lord commanded moses
and at that time came joshua and cut off the anakims from the mountains from hebron from debir from anab and from all the mountains of judah and from all the mountains of israel joshua destroyed them utterly with their cities
there was none of the anakims left in the land of the children of israel only in gaza in gath and in ashdod there remained
so joshua took the whole land according to all that the lord said unto moses and joshua gave it for an inheritance unto israel according to their divisions by their tribes and the land rested from war
now these are the kings of the land which the children of israel smote and possessed their land on the other side jordan toward the rising of the sun from the river arnon unto mount hermon and all the plain on the east
sihon king of the amorites who dwelt in heshbon and ruled from aroer which is upon the bank of the river arnon and from the middle of the river and from half gilead even unto the river jabbok which is the border of the children of ammon
and from the plain to the sea of chinneroth on the east and unto the sea of the plain even the salt sea on the east the way to bethjeshimoth and from the south under ashdothpisgah
and the coast of og king of bashan which was of the remnant of the giants that dwelt at ashtaroth and at edrei
and reigned in mount hermon and in salcah and in all bashan unto the border of the geshurites and the maachathites and half gilead the border of sihon king of heshbon
them did moses the servant of the lord and the children of israel smite and moses the servant of the lord gave it for a possession unto the reubenites and the gadites and the half tribe of manasseh
and these are the kings of the country which joshua and the children of israel smote on this side jordan on the west from baalgad in the valley of lebanon even unto the mount halak that goeth up to seir which joshua gave unto the tribes of israel for a possession according to their divisions
in the mountains and in the valleys and in the plains and in the springs and in the wilderness and in the south country the hittites the amorites and the canaanites the perizzites the hivites and the jebusites
the king of jericho one the king of ai which is beside bethel one
the king of jerusalem one the king of hebron one
the king of jarmuth one the king of lachish one
the king of eglon one the king of gezer one
the king of debir one the king of geder one
the king of hormah one the king of arad one
the king of libnah one the king of adullam one
the king of makkedah one the king of bethel one
the king of tappuah one the king of hepher one
the king of aphek one the king of lasharon one
the king of madon one the king of hazor one
the king of shimronmeron one the king of achshaph one
the king of taanach one the king of megiddo one
the king of kedesh one the king of jokneam of carmel one
the king of dor in the coast of dor one the king of the nations of gilgal one
the king of tirzah one all the kings thirty and one
now joshua was old and stricken in years and the lord said unto him thou art old and stricken in years and there remaineth yet very much land to be possessed
this is the land that yet remaineth all the borders of the philistines and all geshuri
from sihor which is before egypt even unto the borders of ekron northward which is counted to the canaanite five lords of the philistines the gazathites and the ashdothites the eshkalonites the gittites and the ekronites also the avites
from the south all the land of the canaanites and mearah that is beside the sidonians unto aphek to the borders of the amorites
and the land of the giblites and all lebanon toward the sunrising from baalgad under mount hermon unto the entering into hamath
all the inhabitants of the hill country from lebanon unto misrephothmaim and all the sidonians them will i drive out from before the children of israel only divide thou it by lot unto the israelites for an inheritance as i have commanded thee
now therefore divide this land for an inheritance unto the nine tribes and the half tribe of manasseh
with whom the reubenites and the gadites have received their inheritance which moses gave them beyond jordan eastward even as moses the servant of the lord gave them
from aroer that is upon the bank of the river arnon and the city that is in the midst of the river and all the plain of medeba unto dibon
and all the cities of sihon king of the amorites which reigned in heshbon unto the border of the children of ammon
and gilead and the border of the geshurites and maachathites and all mount hermon and all bashan unto salcah
all the kingdom of og in bashan which reigned in ashtaroth and in edrei who remained of the remnant of the giants for these did moses smite and cast them out
nevertheless the children of israel expelled not the geshurites nor the maachathites but the geshurites and the maachathites dwell among the israelites until this day
only unto the tribe of levi he gave none inheritance the sacrifices of the lord god of israel made by fire are their inheritance as he said unto them
and moses gave unto the tribe of the children of reuben inheritance according to their families
and their coast was from aroer that is on the bank of the river arnon and the city that is in the midst of the river and all the plain by medeba
heshbon and all her cities that are in the plain dibon and bamothbaal and bethbaalmeon
and jahaza and kedemoth and mephaath
and kirjathaim and sibmah and zarethshahar in the mount of the valley
and bethpeor and ashdothpisgah and bethjeshimoth
and all the cities of the plain and all the kingdom of sihon king of the amorites which reigned in heshbon whom moses smote with the princes of midian evi and rekem and zur and hur and reba which were dukes of sihon dwelling in the country
balaam also the son of beor the soothsayer did the children of israel slay with the sword among them that were slain by them
and the border of the children of reuben was jordan and the border thereof this was the inheritance of the children of reuben after their families the cities and the villages thereof
and moses gave inheritance unto the tribe of gad even unto the children of gad according to their families
and their coast was jazer and all the cities of gilead and half the land of the children of ammon unto aroer that is before rabbah
and from heshbon unto ramathmizpeh and betonim and from mahanaim unto the border of debir
and in the valley betharam and bethnimrah and succoth and zaphon the rest of the kingdom of sihon king of heshbon jordan and his border even unto the edge of the sea of chinnereth on the other side jordan eastward
this is the inheritance of the children of gad after their families the cities and their villages
and moses gave inheritance unto the half tribe of manasseh and this was the possession of the half tribe of the children of manasseh by their families
and their coast was from mahanaim all bashan all the kingdom of og king of bashan and all the towns of jair which are in bashan threescore cities
and half gilead and ashtaroth and edrei cities of the kingdom of og in bashan were pertaining unto the children of machir the son of manasseh even to the one half of the children of machir by their families
these are the countries which moses did distribute for inheritance in the plains of moab on the other side jordan by jericho eastward
but unto the tribe of levi moses gave not any inheritance the lord god of israel was their inheritance as he said unto them
and these are the countries which the children of israel inherited in the land of canaan which eleazar the priest and joshua the son of nun and the heads of the fathers of the tribes of the children of israel distributed for inheritance to them
by lot was their inheritance as the lord commanded by the hand of moses for the nine tribes and for the half tribe
for moses had given the inheritance of two tribes and an half tribe on the other side jordan but unto the levites he gave none inheritance among them
for the children of joseph were two tribes manasseh and ephraim therefore they gave no part unto the levites in the land save cities to dwell in with their suburbs for their cattle and for their substance
as the lord commanded moses so the children of israel did and they divided the land
then the children of judah came unto joshua in gilgal and caleb the son of jephunneh the kenezite said unto him thou knowest the thing that the lord said unto moses the man of god concerning me and thee in kadeshbarnea
forty years old was i when moses the servant of the lord sent me from kadeshbarnea to espy out the land and i brought him word again as it was in mine heart
nevertheless my brethren that went up with me made the heart of the people melt but i wholly followed the lord my god
and moses sware on that day saying surely the land whereon thy feet have trodden shall be thine inheritance and thy children's for ever because thou hast wholly followed the lord my god
and now behold the lord hath kept me alive as he said these forty and five years even since the lord spake this word unto moses while the children of israel wandered in the wilderness and now lo i am this day fourscore and five years old
