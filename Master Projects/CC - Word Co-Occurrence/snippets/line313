 a stone by thee
 throws a stone at him
apemantus beast
timon slave
apemantus toad
timon rogue rogue rogue
 i am sick of this false world and will love nought
 but even the mere necessities upon t
 then timon presently prepare thy grave
 lie where the light foam the sea may beat
 thy gravestone daily make thine epitaph
 that death in me at others lives may laugh
 to the gold
 o thou sweet kingkiller and dear divorce
 twixt natural son and sire thou bright defiler
 of hymen's purest bed thou valiant mars
 thou ever young fresh loved and delicate wooer
 whose blush doth thaw the consecrated snow
 that lies on dian's lap thou visible god
 that solder'st close impossibilities
 and makest them kiss that speak'st with
 every tongue
 to every purpose o thou touch of hearts
 think thy slave man rebels and by thy virtue
 set them into confounding odds that beasts
 may have the world in empire
apemantus would twere so
 but not till i am dead i'll say thou'st gold
 thou wilt be throng'd to shortly
timon throng'd to
apemantus ay
timon thy back i prithee
apemantus live and love thy misery
timon long live so and so die
 exit apemantus
 i am quit
 moe things like men eat timon and abhor them
 enter banditti
first bandit where should he have this gold it is some poor
 fragment some slender sort of his remainder the
 mere want of gold and the fallingfrom of his
 friends drove him into this melancholy
second bandit it is noised he hath a mass of treasure
third bandit let us make the assay upon him if he care not
 for't he will supply us easily if he covetously
 reserve it how shall's get it
second bandit true for he bears it not about him tis hid
first bandit is not this he
banditti where
second bandit tis his description
third bandit he i know him
banditti save thee timon
timon now thieves
banditti soldiers not thieves
timon both too and women's sons
banditti we are not thieves but men that much do want
timon your greatest want is you want much of meat
 why should you want behold the earth hath roots
 within this mile break forth a hundred springs
 the oaks bear mast the briers scarlet hips
 the bounteous housewife nature on each bush
 lays her full mess before you want why want
first bandit we cannot live on grass on berries water
 as beasts and birds and fishes
timon nor on the beasts themselves the birds and fishes
 you must eat men yet thanks i must you con
 that you are thieves profess'd that you work not
 in holier shapes for there is boundless theft
 in limited professions rascal thieves
 here's gold go suck the subtle blood o the grape
 till the high fever seethe your blood to froth
 and so scape hanging trust not the physician
 his antidotes are poison and he slays
 moe than you rob take wealth and lives together
 do villany do since you protest to do't
 like workmen i'll example you with thievery
 the sun's a thief and with his great attraction
 robs the vast sea the moon's an arrant thief
 and her pale fire she snatches from the sun
 the sea's a thief whose liquid surge resolves
 the moon into salt tears the earth's a thief
 that feeds and breeds by a composture stolen
 from general excrement each thing's a thief
 the laws your curb and whip in their rough power
 have uncheque'd theft love not yourselves away
 rob one another there's more gold cut throats
 all that you meet are thieves to athens go
 break open shops nothing can you steal
 but thieves do lose it steal no less for this
 i give you and gold confound you howsoe'er amen
third bandit has almost charmed me from my profession by
 persuading me to it
first bandit tis in the malice of mankind that he thus advises
 us not to have us thrive in our mystery
second bandit i'll believe him as an enemy and give over my trade
first bandit let us first see peace in athens there is no time
 so miserable but a man may be true
 exeunt banditti
 enter flavius
flavius o you gods
 is yond despised and ruinous man my lord
 full of decay and failing o monument
 and wonder of good deeds evilly bestow'd
 what an alteration of honour
 has desperate want made
 what viler thing upon the earth than friends
 who can bring noblest minds to basest ends
 how rarely does it meet with this time's guise
 when man was wish'd to love his enemies
 grant i may ever love and rather woo
 those that would mischief me than those that do
 has caught me in his eye i will present
 my honest grief unto him and as my lord
 still serve him with my life my dearest master
timon away what art thou
flavius have you forgot me sir
timon why dost ask that i have forgot all men
 then if thou grant'st thou'rt a man i have forgot thee
flavius an honest poor servant of yours
timon then i know thee not
 i never had honest man about me i all
 i kept were knaves to serve in meat to villains
flavius the gods are witness
 ne'er did poor steward wear a truer grief
 for his undone lord than mine eyes for you
timon what dost thou weep come nearer then i
 love thee
 because thou art a woman and disclaim'st
 flinty mankind whose eyes do never give
 but thorough lust and laughter pity's sleeping
 strange times that weep with laughing not with weeping
flavius i beg of you to know me good my lord
 to accept my grief and whilst this poor wealth lasts
 to entertain me as your steward still
timon had i a steward
 so true so just and now so comfortable
 it almost turns my dangerous nature mild
 let me behold thy face surely this man
 was born of woman
 forgive my general and exceptless rashness
 you perpetualsober gods i do proclaim
 one honest manmistake me notbut one
 no more i prayand he's a steward
 how fain would i have hated all mankind
 and thou redeem'st thyself but all save thee
 i fell with curses
 methinks thou art more honest now than wise
 for by oppressing and betraying me
 thou mightst have sooner got another service
 for many so arrive at second masters
 upon their first lord's neck but tell me true
 for i must ever doubt though ne'er so sure
 is not thy kindness subtle covetous
 if not a usuring kindness and as rich men deal gifts
 expecting in return twenty for one
flavius no my most worthy master in whose breast
 doubt and suspect alas are placed too late
 you should have fear'd false times when you did feast
 suspect still comes where an estate is least
 that which i show heaven knows is merely love
 duty and zeal to your unmatched mind
 care of your food and living and believe it
 my most honour'd lord
 for any benefit that points to me
 either in hope or present i'ld exchange
 for this one wish that you had power and wealth
 to requite me by making rich yourself
timon look thee tis so thou singly honest man
 here take the gods out of my misery
 have sent thee treasure go live rich and happy
 but thus condition'd thou shalt build from men
 hate all curse all show charity to none
 but let the famish'd flesh slide from the bone
 ere thou relieve the beggar give to dogs
 what thou deny'st to men let prisons swallow em
 debts wither em to nothing be men like
 blasted woods
 and may diseases lick up their false bloods
 and so farewell and thrive
flavius o let me stay
 and comfort you my master
timon if thou hatest curses
 stay not fly whilst thou art blest and free
 ne'er see thou man and let me ne'er see thee
 exit flavius timon retires to his cave
 timon of athens
act v
scene i the woods before timon's cave
 enter poet and painter timon watching
 them from his cave
painter as i took note of the place it cannot be far where
 he abides
poet what's to be thought of him does the rumour hold
 for true that he's so full of gold
painter certain alcibiades reports it phrynia and
 timandra had gold of him he likewise enriched poor
 straggling soldiers with great quantity tis said
 he gave unto his steward a mighty sum
poet then this breaking of his has been but a try for his friends
painter nothing else you shall see him a palm in athens
