clown truly madam he holds belzebub at the staves's end as
 well as a man in his case may do has here writ a
 letter to you i should have given't you today
 morning but as a madman's epistles are no gospels
 so it skills not much when they are delivered
olivia open't and read it
clown look then to be well edified when the fool delivers
 the madman
 reads
 by the lord madam'
olivia how now art thou mad
clown no madam i do but read madness an your ladyship
 will have it as it ought to be you must allow vox
olivia prithee read i thy right wits
clown so i do madonna but to read his right wits is to
 read thus therefore perpend my princess and give ear
olivia read it you sirrah
 to fabian
fabian reads by the lord madam you wrong me and the
 world shall know it though you have put me into
 darkness and given your drunken cousin rule over
 me yet have i the benefit of my senses as well as
 your ladyship i have your own letter that induced
 me to the semblance i put on with the which i doubt
 not but to do myself much right or you much shame
 think of me as you please i leave my duty a little
 unthought of and speak out of my injury
 the madlyused malvolio'
olivia did he write this
clown ay madam
duke orsino this savours not much of distraction
olivia see him deliver'd fabian bring him hither
 exit fabian
 my lord so please you these things further
 thought on
 to think me as well a sister as a wife
 one day shall crown the alliance on't so please you
 here at my house and at my proper cost
duke orsino madam i am most apt to embrace your offer
 to viola
 your master quits you and for your service done him
 so much against the mettle of your sex
 so far beneath your soft and tender breeding
 and since you call'd me master for so long
 here is my hand you shall from this time be
 your master's mistress
olivia a sister you are she
 reenter fabian with malvolio
duke orsino is this the madman
olivia ay my lord this same
 how now malvolio
malvolio madam you have done me wrong
 notorious wrong
olivia have i malvolio no
malvolio lady you have pray you peruse that letter
 you must not now deny it is your hand
 write from it if you can in hand or phrase
 or say tis not your seal nor your invention
 you can say none of this well grant it then
 and tell me in the modesty of honour
 why you have given me such clear lights of favour
 bade me come smiling and crossgarter'd to you
 to put on yellow stockings and to frown
 upon sir toby and the lighter people
 and acting this in an obedient hope
 why have you suffer'd me to be imprison'd
 kept in a dark house visited by the priest
 and made the most notorious geck and gull
 that e'er invention play'd on tell me why
olivia alas malvolio this is not my writing
 though i confess much like the character
 but out of question tis maria's hand
 and now i do bethink me it was she
 first told me thou wast mad then camest in smiling
 and in such forms which here were presupposed
 upon thee in the letter prithee be content
 this practise hath most shrewdly pass'd upon thee
 but when we know the grounds and authors of it
 thou shalt be both the plaintiff and the judge
 of thine own cause
fabian good madam hear me speak
 and let no quarrel nor no brawl to come
 taint the condition of this present hour
 which i have wonder'd at in hope it shall not
 most freely i confess myself and toby
 set this device against malvolio here
 upon some stubborn and uncourteous parts
 we had conceived against him maria writ
 the letter at sir toby's great importance
 in recompense whereof he hath married her
 how with a sportful malice it was follow'd
 may rather pluck on laughter than revenge
 if that the injuries be justly weigh'd
 that have on both sides pass'd
olivia alas poor fool how have they baffled thee
clown why some are born great some achieve greatness
 and some have greatness thrown upon them i was
 one sir in this interlude one sir topas sir but
 that's all one by the lord fool i am not mad'
 but do you remember madam why laugh you at such
 a barren rascal an you smile not he's gagged'
 and thus the whirligig of time brings in his revenges
malvolio i'll be revenged on the whole pack of you
 exit
olivia he hath been most notoriously abused
duke orsino pursue him and entreat him to a peace
 he hath not told us of the captain yet
 when that is known and golden time convents
 a solemn combination shall be made
 of our dear souls meantime sweet sister
 we will not part from hence cesario come
 for so you shall be while you are a man
 but when in other habits you are seen
 orsino's mistress and his fancy's queen
 exeunt all except clown
clown sings
 when that i was and a little tiny boy
 with hey ho the wind and the rain
 a foolish thing was but a toy
 for the rain it raineth every day
 but when i came to man's estate
 with hey ho &c
 gainst knaves and thieves men shut their gate
 for the rain &c
 but when i came alas to wive
 with hey ho &c
 by swaggering could i never thrive
 for the rain &c
 but when i came unto my beds
 with hey ho &c
 with tosspots still had drunken heads
 for the rain &c
 a great while ago the world begun
 with hey ho &c
 but that's all one our play is done
 and we'll strive to please you every day

scene i verona an open place
 enter valentine and proteus
valentine cease to persuade my loving proteus
 homekeeping youth have ever homely wits
 were't not affection chains thy tender days
 to the sweet glances of thy honour'd love
 i rather would entreat thy company
 to see the wonders of the world abroad
 than living dully sluggardized at home
 wear out thy youth with shapeless idleness
 but since thou lovest love still and thrive therein
 even as i would when i to love begin
proteus wilt thou be gone sweet valentine adieu
 think on thy proteus when thou haply seest
 some rare noteworthy object in thy travel
 wish me partaker in thy happiness
 when thou dost meet good hap and in thy danger
 if ever danger do environ thee
 commend thy grievance to my holy prayers
 for i will be thy beadsman valentine
valentine and on a lovebook pray for my success
proteus upon some book i love i'll pray for thee
valentine that's on some shallow story of deep love
 how young leander cross'd the hellespont
proteus that's a deep story of a deeper love
 for he was more than over shoes in love
valentine tis true for you are over boots in love
 and yet you never swum the hellespont
proteus over the boots nay give me not the boots
valentine no i will not for it boots thee not
proteus what
valentine to be in love where scorn is bought with groans
 coy looks with heartsore sighs one fading moment's mirth
 with twenty watchful weary tedious nights
 if haply won perhaps a hapless gain
 if lost why then a grievous labour won
 however but a folly bought with wit
 or else a wit by folly vanquished
proteus so by your circumstance you call me fool
