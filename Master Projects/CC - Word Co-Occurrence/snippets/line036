therefore the kinsman said unto boaz buy it for thee so he drew off his shoe
and boaz said unto the elders and unto all the people ye are witnesses this day that i have bought all that was elimelech's and all that was chilion's and mahlon's of the hand of naomi
moreover ruth the moabitess the wife of mahlon have i purchased to be my wife to raise up the name of the dead upon his inheritance that the name of the dead be not cut off from among his brethren and from the gate of his place ye are witnesses this day
and all the people that were in the gate and the elders said we are witnesses the lord make the woman that is come into thine house like rachel and like leah which two did build the house of israel and do thou worthily in ephratah and be famous in bethlehem
and let thy house be like the house of pharez whom tamar bare unto judah of the seed which the lord shall give thee of this young woman
so boaz took ruth and she was his wife and when he went in unto her the lord gave her conception and she bare a son
and the women said unto naomi blessed be the lord which hath not left thee this day without a kinsman that his name may be famous in israel
and he shall be unto thee a restorer of thy life and a nourisher of thine old age for thy daughter in law which loveth thee which is better to thee than seven sons hath born him
and naomi took the child and laid it in her bosom and became nurse unto it
and the women her neighbours gave it a name saying there is a son born to naomi and they called his name obed he is the father of jesse the father of david
now these are the generations of pharez pharez begat hezron
and hezron begat ram and ram begat amminadab
and amminadab begat nahshon and nahshon begat salmon
and salmon begat boaz and boaz begat obed
and obed begat jesse and jesse begat david
1sm11 now there was a certain man of ramathaimzophim of mount ephraim and his name was elkanah the son of jeroham the son of elihu the son of tohu the son of zuph an ephrathite
1sm12 and he had two wives the name of the one was hannah and the name of the other peninnah and peninnah had children but hannah had no children
1sm13 and this man went up out of his city yearly to worship and to sacrifice unto the lord of hosts in shiloh and the two sons of eli hophni and phinehas the priests of the lord were there
1sm14 and when the time was that elkanah offered he gave to peninnah his wife and to all her sons and her daughters portions
1sm15 but unto hannah he gave a worthy portion for he loved hannah but the lord had shut up her womb
1sm16 and her adversary also provoked her sore for to make her fret because the lord had shut up her womb
1sm17 and as he did so year by year when she went up to the house of the lord so she provoked her therefore she wept and did not eat
1sm18 then said elkanah her husband to her hannah why weepest thou and why eatest thou not and why is thy heart grieved am not i better to thee than ten sons
1sm19 so hannah rose up after they had eaten in shiloh and after they had drunk now eli the priest sat upon a seat by a post of the temple of the lord
1sm110 and she was in bitterness of soul and prayed unto the lord and wept sore
1sm111 and she vowed a vow and said o lord of hosts if thou wilt indeed look on the affliction of thine handmaid and remember me and not forget thine handmaid but wilt give unto thine handmaid a man child then i will give him unto the lord all the days of his life and there shall no razor come upon his head
1sm112 and it came to pass as she continued praying before the lord that eli marked her mouth
1sm113 now hannah she spake in her heart only her lips moved but her voice was not heard therefore eli thought she had been drunken
1sm114 and eli said unto her how long wilt thou be drunken put away thy wine from thee
1sm115 and hannah answered and said no my lord i am a woman of a sorrowful spirit i have drunk neither wine nor strong drink but have poured out my soul before the lord
1sm116 count not thine handmaid for a daughter of belial for out of the abundance of my complaint and grief have i spoken hitherto
1sm117 then eli answered and said go in peace and the god of israel grant thee thy petition that thou hast asked of him
1sm118 and she said let thine handmaid find grace in thy sight so the woman went her way and did eat and her countenance was no more sad
1sm119 and they rose up in the morning early and worshipped before the lord and returned and came to their house to ramah and elkanah knew hannah his wife and the lord remembered her
1sm120 wherefore it came to pass when the time was come about after hannah had conceived that she bare a son and called his name samuel saying because i have asked him of the lord
1sm121 and the man elkanah and all his house went up to offer unto the lord the yearly sacrifice and his vow
1sm122 but hannah went not up for she said unto her husband i will not go up until the child be weaned and then i will bring him that he may appear before the lord and there abide for ever
1sm123 and elkanah her husband said unto her do what seemeth thee good tarry until thou have weaned him only the lord establish his word so the woman abode and gave her son suck until she weaned him
1sm124 and when she had weaned him she took him up with her with three bullocks and one ephah of flour and a bottle of wine and brought him unto the house of the lord in shiloh and the child was young
1sm125 and they slew a bullock and brought the child to eli
1sm126 and she said oh my lord as thy soul liveth my lord i am the woman that stood by thee here praying unto the lord
1sm127 for this child i prayed and the lord hath given me my petition which i asked of him
1sm128 therefore also i have lent him to the lord as long as he liveth he shall be lent to the lord and he worshipped the lord there
1sm21 and hannah prayed and said my heart rejoiceth in the lord mine horn is exalted in the lord my mouth is enlarged over mine enemies because i rejoice in thy salvation
1sm22 there is none holy as the lord for there is none beside thee neither is there any rock like our god
1sm23 talk no more so exceeding proudly let not arrogancy come out of your mouth for the lord is a god of knowledge and by him actions are weighed
1sm24 the bows of the mighty men are broken and they that stumbled are girded with strength
1sm25 they that were full have hired out themselves for bread and they that were hungry ceased so that the barren hath born seven and she that hath many children is waxed feeble
1sm26 the lord killeth and maketh alive he bringeth down to the grave and bringeth up
1sm27 the lord maketh poor and maketh rich he bringeth low and lifteth up
1sm28 he raiseth up the poor out of the dust and lifteth up the beggar from the dunghill to set them among princes and to make them inherit the throne of glory for the pillars of the earth are the lord's and he hath set the world upon them
1sm29 he will keep the feet of his saints and the wicked shall be silent in darkness for by strength shall no man prevail
1sm210 the adversaries of the lord shall be broken to pieces out of heaven shall he thunder upon them the lord shall judge the ends of the earth and he shall give strength unto his king and exalt the horn of his anointed
1sm211 and elkanah went to ramah to his house and the child did minister unto the lord before eli the priest
1sm212 now the sons of eli were sons of belial they knew not the lord
1sm213 and the priests custom with the people was that when any man offered sacrifice the priest's servant came while the flesh was in seething with a fleshhook of three teeth in his hand
1sm214 and he struck it into the pan or kettle or caldron or pot all that the fleshhook brought up the priest took for himself so they did in shiloh unto all the israelites that came thither
1sm215 also before they burnt the fat the priest's servant came and said to the man that sacrificed give flesh to roast for the priest for he will not have sodden flesh of thee but raw
1sm216 and if any man said unto him let them not fail to burn the fat presently and then take as much as thy soul desireth then he would answer him nay but thou shalt give it me now and if not i will take it by force
1sm217 wherefore the sin of the young men was very great before the lord for men abhorred the offering of the lord
1sm218 but samuel ministered before the lord being a child girded with a linen ephod
1sm219 moreover his mother made him a little coat and brought it to him from year to year when she came up with her husband to offer the yearly sacrifice
1sm220 and eli blessed elkanah and his wife and said the lord give thee seed of this woman for the loan which is lent to the lord and they went unto their own home
1sm221 and the lord visited hannah so that she conceived and bare three sons and two daughters and the child samuel grew before the lord
1sm222 now eli was very old and heard all that his sons did unto all israel and how they lay with the women that assembled at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation
1sm223 and he said unto them why do ye such things for i hear of your evil dealings by all this people
1sm224 nay my sons for it is no good report that i hear ye make the lord's people to transgress
1sm225 if one man sin against another the judge shall judge him but if a man sin against the lord who shall intreat for him notwithstanding they hearkened not unto the voice of their father because the lord would slay them
1sm226 and the child samuel grew on and was in favour both with the lord and also with men
1sm227 and there came a man of god unto eli and said unto him thus saith the lord did i plainly appear unto the house of thy father when they were in egypt in pharaoh's house
1sm228 and did i choose him out of all the tribes of israel to be my priest to offer upon mine altar to burn incense to wear an ephod before me and did i give unto the house of thy father all the offerings made by fire of the children of israel
1sm229 wherefore kick ye at my sacrifice and at mine offering which i have commanded in my habitation and honourest thy sons above me to make yourselves fat with the chiefest of all the offerings of israel my people
1sm230 wherefore the lord god of israel saith i said indeed that thy house and the house of thy father should walk before me for ever but now the lord saith be it far from me for them that honour me i will honour and they that despise me shall be lightly esteemed
1sm231 behold the days come that i will cut off thine arm and the arm of thy father's house that there shall not be an old man in thine house
1sm232 and thou shalt see an enemy in my habitation in all the wealth which god shall give israel and there shall not be an old man in thine house for ever
1sm233 and the man of thine whom i shall not cut off from mine altar shall be to consume thine eyes and to grieve thine heart and all the increase of thine house shall die in the flower of their age
1sm234 and this shall be a sign unto thee that shall come upon thy two sons on hophni and phinehas in one day they shall die both of them
1sm235 and i will raise me up a faithful priest that shall do according to that which is in mine heart and in my mind and i will build him a sure house and he shall walk before mine anointed for ever
1sm236 and it shall come to pass that every one that is left in thine house shall come and crouch to him for a piece of silver and a morsel of bread and shall say put me i pray thee into one of the priests offices that i may eat a piece of bread
1sm31 and the child samuel ministered unto the lord before eli and the word of the lord was precious in those days there was no open vision
1sm32 and it came to pass at that time when eli was laid down in his place and his eyes began to wax dim that he could not see
1sm33 and ere the lamp of god went out in the temple of the lord where the ark of god was and samuel was laid down to sleep
1sm34 that the lord called samuel and he answered here am i
1sm35 and he ran unto eli and said here am i for thou calledst me and he said i called not lie down again and he went and lay down
1sm36 and the lord called yet again samuel and samuel arose and went to eli and said here am i for thou didst call me and he answered i called not my son lie down again
1sm37 now samuel did not yet know the lord neither was the word of the lord yet revealed unto him
1sm38 and the lord called samuel again the third time and he arose and went to eli and said here am i for thou didst call me and eli perceived that the lord had called the child
1sm39 therefore eli said unto samuel go lie down and it shall be if he call thee that thou shalt say speak lord for thy servant heareth so samuel went and lay down in his place
1sm310 and the lord came and stood and called as at other times samuel samuel then samuel answered speak for thy servant heareth
1sm311 and the lord said to samuel behold i will do a thing in israel at which both the ears of every one that heareth it shall tingle
1sm312 in that day i will perform against eli all things which i have spoken concerning his house when i begin i will also make an end
1sm313 for i have told him that i will judge his house for ever for the iniquity which he knoweth because his sons made themselves vile and he restrained them not
1sm314 and therefore i have sworn unto the house of eli that the iniquity of eli's house shall not be purged with sacrifice nor offering for ever
1sm315 and samuel lay until the morning and opened the doors of the house of the lord and samuel feared to shew eli the vision
1sm316 then eli called samuel and said samuel my son and he answered here am i
1sm317 and he said what is the thing that the lord hath said unto thee i pray thee hide it not from me god do so to thee and more also if thou hide any thing from me of all the things that he said unto thee
1sm318 and samuel told him every whit and hid nothing from him and he said it is the lord let him do what seemeth him good
1sm319 and samuel grew and the lord was with him and did let none of his words fall to the ground
1sm320 and all israel from dan even to beersheba knew that samuel was established to be a prophet of the lord
1sm321 and the lord appeared again in shiloh for the lord revealed himself to samuel in shiloh by the word of the lord
1sm41 and the word of samuel came to all israel now israel went out against the philistines to battle and pitched beside ebenezer and the philistines pitched in aphek
1sm42 and the philistines put themselves in array against israel and when they joined battle israel was smitten before the philistines and they slew of the army in the field about four thousand men
1sm43 and when the people were come into the camp the elders of israel said wherefore hath the lord smitten us to day before the philistines let us fetch the ark of the covenant of the lord out of shiloh unto us that when it cometh among us it may save us out of the hand of our enemies
1sm44 so the people sent to shiloh that they might bring from thence the ark of the covenant of the lord of hosts which dwelleth between the cherubims and the two sons of eli hophni and phinehas were there with the ark of the covenant of god
1sm45 and when the ark of the covenant of the lord came into the camp all israel shouted with a great shout so that the earth rang again
1sm46 and when the philistines heard the noise of the shout they said what meaneth the noise of this great shout in the camp of the hebrews and they understood that the ark of the lord was come into the camp
1sm47 and the philistines were afraid for they said god is come into the camp and they said woe unto us for there hath not been such a thing heretofore
1sm48 woe unto us who shall deliver us out of the hand of these mighty gods these are the gods that smote the egyptians with all the plagues in the wilderness
1sm49 be strong and quit yourselves like men o ye philistines that ye be not servants unto the hebrews as they have been to you quit yourselves like men and fight
1sm410 and the philistines fought and israel was smitten and they fled every man into his tent and there was a very great slaughter for there fell of israel thirty thousand footmen
1sm411 and the ark of god was taken and the two sons of eli hophni and phinehas were slain
1sm412 and there ran a man of benjamin out of the army and came to shiloh the same day with his clothes rent and with earth upon his head
1sm413 and when he came lo eli sat upon a seat by the wayside watching for his heart trembled for the ark of god and when the man came into the city and told it all the city cried out
1sm414 and when eli heard the noise of the crying he said what meaneth the noise of this tumult and the man came in hastily and told eli
1sm415 now eli was ninety and eight years old and his eyes were dim that he could not see
1sm416 and the man said unto eli i am he that came out of the army and i fled to day out of the army and he said what is there done my son
1sm417 and the messenger answered and said israel is fled before the philistines and there hath been also a great slaughter among the people and thy two sons also hophni and phinehas are dead and the ark of god is taken
1sm418 and it came to pass when he made mention of the ark of god that he fell from off the seat backward by the side of the gate and his neck brake and he died for he was an old man and heavy and he had judged israel forty years
1sm419 and his daughter in law phinehas wife was with child near to be delivered and when she heard the tidings that the ark of god was taken and that her father in law and her husband were dead she bowed herself and travailed for her pains came upon her
1sm420 and about the time of her death the women that stood by her said unto her fear not for thou hast born a son but she answered not neither did she regard it
1sm421 and she named the child ichabod saying the glory is departed from israel because the ark of god was taken and because of her father in law and her husband
1sm422 and she said the glory is departed from israel for the ark of god is taken
1sm51 and the philistines took the ark of god and brought it from ebenezer unto ashdod
1sm52 when the philistines took the ark of god they brought it into the house of dagon and set it by dagon
1sm53 and when they of ashdod arose early on the morrow behold dagon was fallen upon his face to the earth before the ark of the lord and they took dagon and set him in his place again
1sm54 and when they arose early on the morrow morning behold dagon was fallen upon his face to the ground before the ark of the lord and the head of dagon and both the palms of his hands were cut off upon the threshold only the stump of dagon was left to him
1sm55 therefore neither the priests of dagon nor any that come into dagon's house tread on the threshold of dagon in ashdod unto this day
1sm56 but the hand of the lord was heavy upon them of ashdod and he destroyed them and smote them with emerods even ashdod and the coasts thereof
1sm57 and when the men of ashdod saw that it was so they said the ark of the god of israel shall not abide with us for his hand is sore upon us and upon dagon our god
1sm58 they sent therefore and gathered all the lords of the philistines unto them and said what shall we do with the ark of the god of israel and they answered let the ark of the god of israel be carried about unto gath and they carried the ark of the god of israel about thither
1sm59 and it was so that after they had carried it about the hand of the lord was against the city with a very great destruction and he smote the men of the city both small and great and they had emerods in their secret parts
1sm510 therefore they sent the ark of god to ekron and it came to pass as the ark of god came to ekron that the ekronites cried out saying they have brought about the ark of the god of israel to us to slay us and our people
1sm511 so they sent and gathered together all the lords of the philistines and said send away the ark of the god of israel and let it go again to his own place that it slay us not and our people for there was a deadly destruction throughout all the city the hand of god was very heavy there
1sm512 and the men that died not were smitten with the emerods and the cry of the city went up to heaven
1sm61 and the ark of the lord was in the country of the philistines seven months
1sm62 and the philistines called for the priests and the diviners saying what shall we do to the ark of the lord tell us wherewith we shall send it to his place
1sm63 and they said if ye send away the ark of the god of israel send it not empty but in any wise return him a trespass offering then ye shall be healed and it shall be known to you why his hand is not removed from you
1sm64 then said they what shall be the trespass offering which we shall return to him they answered five golden emerods and five golden mice according to the number of the lords of the philistines for one plague was on you all and on your lords
1sm65 wherefore ye shall make images of your emerods and images of your mice that mar the land and ye shall give glory unto the god of israel peradventure he will lighten his hand from off you and from off your gods and from off your land
1sm66 wherefore then do ye harden your hearts as the egyptians and pharaoh hardened their hearts when he had wrought wonderfully among them did they not let the people go and they departed
1sm67 now therefore make a new cart and take two milch kine on which there hath come no yoke and tie the kine to the cart and bring their calves home from them
1sm68 and take the ark of the lord and lay it upon the cart and put the jewels of gold which ye return him for a trespass offering in a coffer by the side thereof and send it away that it may go
1sm69 and see if it goeth up by the way of his own coast to bethshemesh then he hath done us this great evil but if not then we shall know that it is not his hand that smote us it was a chance that happened to us
1sm610 and the men did so and took two milch kine and tied them to the cart and shut up their calves at home
1sm611 and they laid the ark of the lord upon the cart and the coffer with the mice of gold and the images of their emerods
1sm612 and the kine took the straight way to the way of bethshemesh and went along the highway lowing as they went and turned not aside to the right hand or to the left and the lords of the philistines went after them unto the border of bethshemesh
1sm613 and they of bethshemesh were reaping their wheat harvest in the valley and they lifted up their eyes and saw the ark and rejoiced to see it
1sm614 and the cart came into the field of joshua a bethshemite and stood there where there was a great stone and they clave the wood of the cart and offered the kine a burnt offering unto the lord
1sm615 and the levites took down the ark of the lord and the coffer that was with it wherein the jewels of gold were and put them on the great stone and the men of bethshemesh offered burnt offerings and sacrificed sacrifices the same day unto the lord
1sm616 and when the five lords of the philistines had seen it they returned to ekron the same day
1sm617 and these are the golden emerods which the philistines returned for a trespass offering unto the lord for ashdod one for gaza one for askelon one for gath one for ekron one
1sm618 and the golden mice according to the number of all the cities of the philistines belonging to the five lords both of fenced cities and of country villages even unto the great stone of abel whereon they set down the ark of the lord which stone remaineth unto this day in the field of joshua the bethshemite
1sm619 and he smote the men of bethshemesh because they had looked into the ark of the lord even he smote of the people fifty thousand and threescore and ten men and the people lamented because the lord had smitten many of the people with a great slaughter
1sm620 and the men of bethshemesh said who is able to stand before this holy lord god and to whom shall he go up from us
1sm621 and they sent messengers to the inhabitants of kirjathjearim saying the philistines have brought again the ark of the lord come ye down and fetch it up to you
1sm71 and the men of kirjathjearim came and fetched up the ark of the lord and brought it into the house of abinadab in the hill and sanctified eleazar his son to keep the ark of the lord
1sm72 and it came to pass while the ark abode in kirjathjearim that the time was long for it was twenty years and all the house of israel lamented after the lord
1sm73 and samuel spake unto all the house of israel saying if ye do return unto the lord with all your hearts then put away the strange gods and ashtaroth from among you and prepare your hearts unto the lord and serve him only and he will deliver you out of the hand of the philistines
1sm74 then the children of israel did put away baalim and ashtaroth and served the lord only
1sm75 and samuel said gather all israel to mizpeh and i will pray for you unto the lord
1sm76 and they gathered together to mizpeh and drew water and poured it out before the lord and fasted on that day and said there we have sinned against the lord and samuel judged the children of israel in mizpeh
1sm77 and when the philistines heard that the children of israel were gathered together to mizpeh the lords of the philistines went up against israel and when the children of israel heard it they were afraid of the philistines
1sm78 and the children of israel said to samuel cease not to cry unto the lord our god for us that he will save us out of the hand of the philistines
1sm79 and samuel took a sucking lamb and offered it for a burnt offering wholly unto the lord and samuel cried unto the lord for israel and the lord heard him
1sm710 and as samuel was offering up the burnt offering the philistines drew near to battle against israel but the lord thundered with a great thunder on that day upon the philistines and discomfited them and they were smitten before israel
1sm711 and the men of israel went out of mizpeh and pursued the philistines and smote them until they came under bethcar
1sm712 then samuel took a stone and set it between mizpeh and shen and called the name of it ebenezer saying hitherto hath the lord helped us
1sm713 so the philistines were subdued and they came no more into the coast of israel and the hand of the lord was against the philistines all the days of samuel
1sm714 and the cities which the philistines had taken from israel were restored to israel from ekron even unto gath and the coasts thereof did israel deliver out of the hands of the philistines and there was peace between israel and the amorites
1sm715 and samuel judged israel all the days of his life
1sm716 and he went from year to year in circuit to bethel and gilgal and mizpeh and judged israel in all those places
1sm717 and his return was to ramah for there was his house and there he judged israel and there he built an altar unto the lord
1sm81 and it came to pass when samuel was old that he made his sons judges over israel
1sm82 now the name of his firstborn was joel and the name of his second abiah they were judges in beersheba
1sm83 and his sons walked not in his ways but turned aside after lucre and took bribes and perverted judgment
1sm84 then all the elders of israel gathered themselves together and came to samuel unto ramah
1sm85 and said unto him behold thou art old and thy sons walk not in thy ways now make us a king to judge us like all the nations
1sm86 but the thing displeased samuel when they said give us a king to judge us and samuel prayed unto the lord
1sm87 and the lord said unto samuel hearken unto the voice of the people in all that they say unto thee for they have not rejected thee but they have rejected me that i should not reign over them
1sm88 according to all the works which they have done since the day that i brought them up out of egypt even unto this day wherewith they have forsaken me and served other gods so do they also unto thee
1sm89 now therefore hearken unto their voice howbeit yet protest solemnly unto them and shew them the manner of the king that shall reign over them
1sm810 and samuel told all the words of the lord unto the people that asked of him a king
1sm811 and he said this will be the manner of the king that shall reign over you he will take your sons and appoint them for himself for his chariots and to be his horsemen and some shall run before his chariots
1sm812 and he will appoint him captains over thousands and captains over fifties and will set them to ear his ground and to reap his harvest and to make his instruments of war and instruments of his chariots
1sm813 and he will take your daughters to be confectionaries and to be cooks and to be bakers
1sm814 and he will take your fields and your vineyards and your oliveyards even the best of them and give them to his servants
1sm815 and he will take the tenth of your seed and of your vineyards and give to his officers and to his servants
1sm816 and he will take your menservants and your maidservants and your goodliest young men and your asses and put them to his work
1sm817 he will take the tenth of your sheep and ye shall be his servants
1sm818 and ye shall cry out in that day because of your king which ye shall have chosen you and the lord will not hear you in that day
1sm819 nevertheless the people refused to obey the voice of samuel and they said nay but we will have a king over us
1sm820 that we also may be like all the nations and that our king may judge us and go out before us and fight our battles
1sm821 and samuel heard all the words of the people and he rehearsed them in the ears of the lord
1sm822 and the lord said to samuel hearken unto their voice and make them a king and samuel said unto the men of israel go ye every man unto his city
1sm91 now there was a man of benjamin whose name was kish the son of abiel the son of zeror the son of bechorath the son of aphiah a benjamite a mighty man of power
1sm92 and he had a son whose name was saul a choice young man and a goodly and there was not among the children of israel a goodlier person than he from his shoulders and upward he was higher than any of the people
1sm93 and the asses of kish saul's father were lost and kish said to saul his son take now one of the servants with thee and arise go seek the asses
1sm94 and he passed through mount ephraim and passed through the land of shalisha but they found them not then they passed through the land of shalim and there they were not and he passed through the land of the benjamites but they found them not
1sm95 and when they were come to the land of zuph saul said to his servant that was with him come and let us return lest my father leave caring for the asses and take thought for us
1sm96 and he said unto him behold now there is in this city a man of god and he is an honourable man all that he saith cometh surely to pass now let us go thither peradventure he can shew us our way that we should go
