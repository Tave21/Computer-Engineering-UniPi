second murderer a man as you are
clarence but not as i am royal
second murderer nor you as we are loyal
clarence thy voice is thunder but thy looks are humble
second murderer my voice is now the king's my looks mine own
clarence how darkly and how deadly dost thou speak
 your eyes do menace me why look you pale
 who sent you hither wherefore do you come
both to to to
clarence to murder me
both ay ay
clarence you scarcely have the hearts to tell me so
 and therefore cannot have the hearts to do it
 wherein my friends have i offended you
first murderer offended us you have not but the king
clarence i shall be reconciled to him again
second murderer never my lord therefore prepare to die
clarence are you call'd forth from out a world of men
 to slay the innocent what is my offence
 where are the evidence that do accuse me
 what lawful quest have given their verdict up
 unto the frowning judge or who pronounced
 the bitter sentence of poor clarence death
 before i be convict by course of law
 to threaten me with death is most unlawful
 i charge you as you hope to have redemption
 by christ's dear blood shed for our grievous sins
 that you depart and lay no hands on me
 the deed you undertake is damnable
first murderer what we will do we do upon command
second murderer and he that hath commanded is the king
clarence erroneous vassal the great king of kings
 hath in the tables of his law commanded
 that thou shalt do no murder and wilt thou then
 spurn at his edict and fulfil a man's
 take heed for he holds vengeance in his hands
 to hurl upon their heads that break his law
second murderer and that same vengeance doth he hurl on thee
 for false forswearing and for murder too
 thou didst receive the holy sacrament
 to fight in quarrel of the house of lancaster
first murderer and like a traitor to the name of god
 didst break that vow and with thy treacherous blade
 unrip'dst the bowels of thy sovereign's son
second murderer whom thou wert sworn to cherish and defend
first murderer how canst thou urge god's dreadful law to us
 when thou hast broke it in so dear degree
clarence alas for whose sake did i that ill deed
 for edward for my brother for his sake why sirs
 he sends ye not to murder me for this
 for in this sin he is as deep as i
 if god will be revenged for this deed
 o know you yet he doth it publicly
 take not the quarrel from his powerful arm
 he needs no indirect nor lawless course
 to cut off those that have offended him
first murderer who made thee then a bloody minister
 when gallantspringing brave plantagenet
 that princely novice was struck dead by thee
clarence my brother's love the devil and my rage
first murderer thy brother's love our duty and thy fault
 provoke us hither now to slaughter thee
clarence oh if you love my brother hate not me
 i am his brother and i love him well
 if you be hired for meed go back again
 and i will send you to my brother gloucester
 who shall reward you better for my life
 than edward will for tidings of my death
second murderer you are deceived your brother gloucester hates you
clarence o no he loves me and he holds me dear
 go you to him from me
both ay so we will
clarence tell him when that our princely father york
 bless'd his three sons with his victorious arm
 and charged us from his soul to love each other
 he little thought of this divided friendship
 bid gloucester think of this and he will weep
first murderer ay millstones as be lesson'd us to weep
clarence o do not slander him for he is kind
first murderer right
 as snow in harvest thou deceivest thyself
 tis he that sent us hither now to slaughter thee
clarence it cannot be for when i parted with him
 he hugg'd me in his arms and swore with sobs
 that he would labour my delivery
second murderer why so he doth now he delivers thee
 from this world's thraldom to the joys of heaven
first murderer make peace with god for you must die my lord
clarence hast thou that holy feeling in thy soul
 to counsel me to make my peace with god
 and art thou yet to thy own soul so blind
 that thou wilt war with god by murdering me
 ah sirs consider he that set you on
 to do this deed will hate you for the deed
second murderer what shall we do
clarence relent and save your souls
first murderer relent tis cowardly and womanish
clarence not to relent is beastly savage devilish
 which of you if you were a prince's son
 being pent from liberty as i am now
 if two such murderers as yourselves came to you
 would not entreat for life
 my friend i spy some pity in thy looks
 o if thine eye be not a flatterer
 come thou on my side and entreat for me
 as you would beg were you in my distress
 a begging prince what beggar pities not
second murderer look behind you my lord
first murderer take that and that if all this will not do
 stabs him
 i'll drown you in the malmseybutt within
 exit with the body
second murderer a bloody deed and desperately dispatch'd
 how fain like pilate would i wash my hands
 of this most grievous guilty murder done
 reenter first murderer
first murderer how now what mean'st thou that thou help'st me not
 by heavens the duke shall know how slack thou art
second murderer i would he knew that i had saved his brother
 take thou the fee and tell him what i say
 for i repent me that the duke is slain
 exit
first murderer so do not i go coward as thou art
 now must i hide his body in some hole
 until the duke take order for his burial
 and when i have my meed i must away
 for this will out and here i must not stay

 have aught committed that is hardly borne
 by any in this presence i desire
 to reconcile me to his friendly peace
 tis death to me to be at enmity
 i hate it and desire all good men's love
 first madam i entreat true peace of you
 which i will purchase with my duteous service
