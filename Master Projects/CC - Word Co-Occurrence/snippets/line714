 take up the rays o the beneficial sun
 and keep it from the earth
norfolk surely sir
 there's in him stuff that puts him to these ends
 for being not propp'd by ancestry whose grace
 chalks successors their way nor call'd upon
 for high feats done to the crown neither allied
 for eminent assistants but spiderlike
 out of his selfdrawing web he gives us note
 the force of his own merit makes his way
 a gift that heaven gives for him which buys
 a place next to the king
abergavenny i cannot tell
 what heaven hath given himlet some graver eye
 pierce into that but i can see his pride
 peep through each part of him whence has he that
 if not from hell the devil is a niggard
 or has given all before and he begins
 a new hell in himself
buckingham why the devil
 upon this french going out took he upon him
 without the privity o the king to appoint
 who should attend on him he makes up the file
 of all the gentry for the most part such
 to whom as great a charge as little honour
 he meant to lay upon and his own letter
 the honourable board of council out
 must fetch him in the papers
abergavenny i do know
 kinsmen of mine three at the least that have
 by this so sickened their estates that never
 they shall abound as formerly
buckingham o many
 have broke their backs with laying manors on em
 for this great journey what did this vanity
 but minister communication of
 a most poor issue
norfolk grievingly i think
 the peace between the french and us not values
 the cost that did conclude it
buckingham every man
 after the hideous storm that follow'd was
 a thing inspired and not consulting broke
 into a general prophecy that this tempest
 dashing the garment of this peace aboded
 the sudden breach on't
norfolk which is budded out
 for france hath flaw'd the league and hath attach'd
 our merchants goods at bourdeaux
abergavenny is it therefore
 the ambassador is silenced
norfolk marry is't
abergavenny a proper title of a peace and purchased
 at a superfluous rate
buckingham why all this business
 our reverend cardinal carried
norfolk like it your grace
 the state takes notice of the private difference
 betwixt you and the cardinal i advise you
 and take it from a heart that wishes towards you
 honour and plenteous safetythat you read
 the cardinal's malice and his potency
 together to consider further that
 what his high hatred would effect wants not
 a minister in his power you know his nature
 that he's revengeful and i know his sword
 hath a sharp edge it's long and t may be said
 it reaches far and where twill not extend
 thither he darts it bosom up my counsel
 you'll find it wholesome lo where comes that rock
 that i advise your shunning
 enter cardinal wolsey the purse borne before him
 certain of the guard and two secretaries with
 papers cardinal wolsey in his passage fixeth his
 eye on buckingham and buckingham on him both full
 of disdain
cardinal wolsey the duke of buckingham's surveyor ha
 where's his examination
first secretary here so please you
cardinal wolsey is he in person ready
first secretary ay please your grace
cardinal wolsey well we shall then know more and buckingham
 shall lessen this big look
 exeunt cardinal wolsey and his train
buckingham this butcher's cur is venommouth'd and i
 have not the power to muzzle him therefore best
 not wake him in his slumber a beggar's book
 outworths a noble's blood
norfolk what are you chafed
 ask god for temperance that's the appliance only
 which your disease requires
buckingham i read in's looks
 matter against me and his eye reviled
 me as his abject object at this instant
 he bores me with some trick he's gone to the king
 i'll follow and outstare him
norfolk stay my lord
 and let your reason with your choler question
 what tis you go about to climb steep hills
 requires slow pace at first anger is like
 a fullhot horse who being allow'd his way
 selfmettle tires him not a man in england
 can advise me like you be to yourself
 as you would to your friend
buckingham i'll to the king
 and from a mouth of honour quite cry down
 this ipswich fellow's insolence or proclaim
 there's difference in no persons
norfolk be advised
 heat not a furnace for your foe so hot
 that it do singe yourself we may outrun
 by violent swiftness that which we run at
 and lose by overrunning know you not
 the fire that mounts the liquor til run o'er
 in seeming to augment it wastes it be advised
 i say again there is no english soul
 more stronger to direct you than yourself
 if with the sap of reason you would quench
 or but allay the fire of passion
buckingham sir
 i am thankful to you and i'll go along
 by your prescription but this topproud fellow
 whom from the flow of gall i name not but
 from sincere motions by intelligence
 and proofs as clear as founts in july when
 we see each grain of gravel i do know
 to be corrupt and treasonous
norfolk say not treasonous'
buckingham to the king i'll say't and make my vouch as strong
 as shore of rock attend this holy fox
 or wolf or bothfor he is equal ravenous
 as he is subtle and as prone to mischief
 as able to perform't his mind and place
 infecting one another yea reciprocally
 only to show his pomp as well in france
 as here at home suggests the king our master
 to this last costly treaty the interview
 that swallow'd so much treasure and like a glass
 did break i the rinsing
norfolk faith and so it did
buckingham pray give me favour sir this cunning cardinal
 the articles o the combination drew
 as himself pleased and they were ratified
 as he cried thus let be to as much end
 as give a crutch to the dead but our countcardinal
 has done this and tis well for worthy wolsey
 who cannot err he did it now this follows
 which as i take it is a kind of puppy
 to the old dam treasoncharles the emperor
 under pretence to see the queen his aunt
 for twas indeed his colour but he came
 to whisper wolseyhere makes visitation
 his fears were that the interview betwixt
 england and france might through their amity
 breed him some prejudice for from this league
 peep'd harms that menaced him he privily
 deals with our cardinal and as i trow
 which i do well for i am sure the emperor
 paid ere he promised whereby his suit was granted
 ere it was ask'd but when the way was made
 and paved with gold the emperor thus desired
 that he would please to alter the king's course
 and break the foresaid peace let the king know
 as soon he shall by me that thus the cardinal
 does buy and sell his honour as he pleases
 and for his own advantage
norfolk i am sorry
 to hear this of him and could wish he were
 something mistaken in't
buckingham no not a syllable
 i do pronounce him in that very shape
 he shall appear in proof
 enter brandon a sergeantatarms before him and
 two or three of the guard
brandon your office sergeant execute it
sergeant sir
 my lord the duke of buckingham and earl
 of hereford stafford and northampton i
 arrest thee of high treason in the name
 of our most sovereign king
buckingham lo you my lord
 the net has fall'n upon me i shall perish
 under device and practise
brandon i am sorry
 to see you ta'en from liberty to look on
 the business present tis his highness pleasure
 you shall to the tower
buckingham it will help me nothing
 to plead mine innocence for that dye is on me
 which makes my whitest part black the will of heaven
 be done in this and all things i obey
 o my lord abergavenny fare you well
brandon nay he must bear you company the king
 to abergavenny
 is pleased you shall to the tower till you know
 how he determines further
abergavenny as the duke said
 the will of heaven be done and the king's pleasure
 by me obey'd
brandon here is a warrant from
