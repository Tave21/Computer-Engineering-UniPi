nerissa your father was ever virtuous and holy men at their
 death have good inspirations therefore the lottery
 that he hath devised in these three chests of gold
 silver and lead whereof who chooses his meaning
 chooses you will no doubt never be chosen by any
 rightly but one who shall rightly love but what
 warmth is there in your affection towards any of
 these princely suitors that are already come
portia i pray thee overname them and as thou namest
 them i will describe them and according to my
 description level at my affection
nerissa first there is the neapolitan prince
portia ay that's a colt indeed for he doth nothing but
 talk of his horse and he makes it a great
 appropriation to his own good parts that he can
 shoe him himself i am much afeard my lady his
 mother played false with a smith
nerissa then there is the county palatine
portia he doth nothing but frown as who should say if you
 will not have me choose he hears merry tales and
 smiles not i fear he will prove the weeping
 philosopher when he grows old being so full of
 unmannerly sadness in his youth i had rather be
 married to a death'shead with a bone in his mouth
 than to either of these god defend me from these
 two
nerissa how say you by the french lord monsieur le bon
portia god made him and therefore let him pass for a man
 in truth i know it is a sin to be a mocker but
 he why he hath a horse better than the
 neapolitan's a better bad habit of frowning than
 the count palatine he is every man in no man if a
 throstle sing he falls straight a capering he will
 fence with his own shadow if i should marry him i
 should marry twenty husbands if he would despise me
 i would forgive him for if he love me to madness i
 shall never requite him
nerissa what say you then to falconbridge the young baron
 of england
portia you know i say nothing to him for he understands
 not me nor i him he hath neither latin french
 nor italian and you will come into the court and
 swear that i have a poor pennyworth in the english
 he is a proper man's picture but alas who can
 converse with a dumbshow how oddly he is suited
 i think he bought his doublet in italy his round
 hose in france his bonnet in germany and his
 behavior every where
nerissa what think you of the scottish lord his neighbour
portia that he hath a neighbourly charity in him for he
 borrowed a box of the ear of the englishman and
 swore he would pay him again when he was able i
 think the frenchman became his surety and sealed
 under for another
nerissa how like you the young german the duke of saxony's nephew
portia very vilely in the morning when he is sober and
 most vilely in the afternoon when he is drunk when
 he is best he is a little worse than a man and
 when he is worst he is little better than a beast
 and the worst fall that ever fell i hope i shall
 make shift to go without him
nerissa if he should offer to choose and choose the right
 casket you should refuse to perform your father's
 will if you should refuse to accept him
portia therefore for fear of the worst i pray thee set a
 deep glass of rhenish wine on the contrary casket
 for if the devil be within and that temptation
 without i know he will choose it i will do any
 thing nerissa ere i'll be married to a sponge
nerissa you need not fear lady the having any of these
 lords they have acquainted me with their
 determinations which is indeed to return to their
 home and to trouble you with no more suit unless
 you may be won by some other sort than your father's
 imposition depending on the caskets
portia if i live to be as old as sibylla i will die as
 chaste as diana unless i be obtained by the manner
 of my father's will i am glad this parcel of wooers
 are so reasonable for there is not one among them
 but i dote on his very absence and i pray god grant
 them a fair departure
nerissa do you not remember lady in your father's time a
 venetian a scholar and a soldier that came hither
 in company of the marquis of montferrat
portia yes yes it was bassanio as i think he was so called
nerissa true madam he of all the men that ever my foolish
 eyes looked upon was the best deserving a fair lady
portia i remember him well and i remember him worthy of
 thy praise
 enter a servingman
 how now what news
servant the four strangers seek for you madam to take
 their leave and there is a forerunner come from a
 fifth the prince of morocco who brings word the
 prince his master will be here tonight
portia if i could bid the fifth welcome with so good a
 heart as i can bid the other four farewell i should
 be glad of his approach if he have the condition
 of a saint and the complexion of a devil i had
 rather he should shrive me than wive me come
 nerissa sirrah go before
 whiles we shut the gates
 upon one wooer another knocks at the door
 exeunt
 the merchant of venice
act i
scene iii venice a public place
 enter bassanio and shylock
shylock three thousand ducats well
bassanio ay sir for three months
shylock for three months well
bassanio for the which as i told you antonio shall be bound
shylock antonio shall become bound well
bassanio may you stead me will you pleasure me shall i
 know your answer
shylock three thousand ducats for three months and antonio bound
bassanio your answer to that
shylock antonio is a good man
bassanio have you heard any imputation to the contrary
shylock oh no no no no my meaning in saying he is a
 good man is to have you understand me that he is
 sufficient yet his means are in supposition he
 hath an argosy bound to tripolis another to the
 indies i understand moreover upon the rialto he
 hath a third at mexico a fourth for england and
 other ventures he hath squandered abroad but ships
 are but boards sailors but men there be landrats
 and waterrats waterthieves and landthieves i
 mean pirates and then there is the peril of waters
 winds and rocks the man is notwithstanding
 sufficient three thousand ducats i think i may
 take his bond
bassanio be assured you may
shylock i will be assured i may and that i may be assured
 i will bethink me may i speak with antonio
bassanio if it please you to dine with us
shylock yes to smell pork to eat of the habitation which
 your prophet the nazarite conjured the devil into i
 will buy with you sell with you talk with you
 walk with you and so following but i will not eat
 with you drink with you nor pray with you what
 news on the rialto who is he comes here
 enter antonio
bassanio this is signior antonio
shylock aside how like a fawning publican he looks
 i hate him for he is a christian
 but more for that in low simplicity
 he lends out money gratis and brings down
 the rate of usance here with us in venice
 if i can catch him once upon the hip
 i will feed fat the ancient grudge i bear him
 he hates our sacred nation and he rails
 even there where merchants most do congregate
 on me my bargains and my wellwon thrift
 which he calls interest cursed be my tribe
 if i forgive him
bassanio shylock do you hear
shylock i am debating of my present store
 and by the near guess of my memory
 i cannot instantly raise up the gross
 of full three thousand ducats what of that
 tubal a wealthy hebrew of my tribe
 will furnish me but soft how many months
 do you desire
 to antonio
 rest you fair good signior
 your worship was the last man in our mouths
antonio shylock although i neither lend nor borrow
 by taking nor by giving of excess
 yet to supply the ripe wants of my friend
 i'll break a custom is he yet possess'd
 how much ye would
shylock ay ay three thousand ducats
antonio and for three months
shylock i had forgot three months you told me so
 well then your bond and let me see but hear you
 methought you said you neither lend nor borrow
 upon advantage
antonio i do never use it
shylock when jacob grazed his uncle laban's sheep
 this jacob from our holy abram was
 as his wise mother wrought in his behalf
 the third possessor ay he was the third
antonio and what of him did he take interest
shylock no not take interest not as you would say
 directly interest mark what jacob did
 when laban and himself were compromised
 that all the eanlings which were streak'd and pied
 should fall as jacob's hire the ewes being rank
 in the end of autumn turned to the rams
 and when the work of generation was
 between these woolly breeders in the act
 the skilful shepherd peel'd me certain wands
 and in the doing of the deed of kind
 he stuck them up before the fulsome ewes
 who then conceiving did in eaning time
 fall particolour'd lambs and those were jacob's
 this was a way to thrive and he was blest
 and thrift is blessing if men steal it not
antonio this was a venture sir that jacob served for
