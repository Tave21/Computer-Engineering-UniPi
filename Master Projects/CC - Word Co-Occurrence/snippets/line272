cassio i have drunk but one cup tonight and that was
 craftily qualified too and behold what innovation
 it makes here i am unfortunate in the infirmity
 and dare not task my weakness with any more
iago what man tis a night of revels the gallants
 desire it
cassio where are they
iago here at the door i pray you call them in
cassio i'll do't but it dislikes me
 exit
iago if i can fasten but one cup upon him
 with that which he hath drunk tonight already
 he'll be as full of quarrel and offence
 as my young mistress dog now my sick fool roderigo
 whom love hath turn'd almost the wrong side out
 to desdemona hath tonight caroused
 potations pottledeep and he's to watch
 three lads of cyprus noble swelling spirits
 that hold their honours in a wary distance
 the very elements of this warlike isle
 have i tonight fluster'd with flowing cups
 and they watch too now mongst this flock of drunkards
 am i to put our cassio in some action
 that may offend the islebut here they come
 if consequence do but approve my dream
 my boat sails freely both with wind and stream
 reenter cassio with him montano and gentlemen
 servants following with wine
cassio fore god they have given me a rouse already
montano good faith a little one not past a pint as i am
 a soldier
iago some wine ho
 sings
 and let me the canakin clink clink
 and let me the canakin clink
 a soldier's a man
 a life's but a span
 why then let a soldier drink
 some wine boys
cassio fore god an excellent song
iago i learned it in england where indeed they are
 most potent in potting your dane your german and
 your swagbellied hollanderdrink hoare nothing
 to your english
cassio is your englishman so expert in his drinking
iago why he drinks you with facility your dane dead
 drunk he sweats not to overthrow your almain he
 gives your hollander a vomit ere the next pottle
 can be filled
cassio to the health of our general
montano i am for it lieutenant and i'll do you justice
iago o sweet england
 king stephen was a worthy peer
 his breeches cost him but a crown
 he held them sixpence all too dear
 with that he call'd the tailor lown
 he was a wight of high renown
 and thou art but of low degree
 tis pride that pulls the country down
 then take thine auld cloak about thee
 some wine ho
cassio why this is a more exquisite song than the other
iago will you hear't again
cassio no for i hold him to be unworthy of his place that
 does those things well god's above all and there
 be souls must be saved and there be souls must not be saved
iago it's true good lieutenant
cassio for mine own partno offence to the general nor
 any man of qualityi hope to be saved
iago and so do i too lieutenant
cassio ay but by your leave not before me the
 lieutenant is to be saved before the ancient let's
 have no more of this let's to our affairsforgive
 us our sinsgentlemen let's look to our business
 do not think gentlemen i am drunk this is my
 ancient this is my right hand and this is my left
 i am not drunk now i can stand well enough and
 speak well enough
all excellent well
cassio why very well then you must not think then that i am drunk
 exit
montano to the platform masters come let's set the watch
iago you see this fellow that is gone before
 he is a soldier fit to stand by caesar
 and give direction and do but see his vice
 tis to his virtue a just equinox
 the one as long as the other tis pity of him
 i fear the trust othello puts him in
 on some odd time of his infirmity
 will shake this island
montano but is he often thus
iago tis evermore the prologue to his sleep
 he'll watch the horologe a double set
 if drink rock not his cradle
montano it were well
 the general were put in mind of it
 perhaps he sees it not or his good nature
 prizes the virtue that appears in cassio
 and looks not on his evils is not this true
 enter roderigo
iago aside to him how now roderigo
 i pray you after the lieutenant go
 exit roderigo
montano and tis great pity that the noble moor
 should hazard such a place as his own second
 with one of an ingraft infirmity
 it were an honest action to say
 so to the moor
iago not i for this fair island
 i do love cassio well and would do much
 to cure him of this evilbut hark what noise
 cry within help help'
 reenter cassio driving in roderigo
cassio you rogue you rascal
montano what's the matter lieutenant
cassio a knave teach me my duty
 i'll beat the knave into a twiggen bottle
roderigo beat me
cassio dost thou prate rogue
 striking roderigo
montano nay good lieutenant
 staying him
 i pray you sir hold your hand
cassio let me go sir
 or i'll knock you o'er the mazzard
montano come come

iago aside to roderigo away i say go out and cry a mutiny
 exit roderigo
 nay good lieutenantalas gentlemen
 help holieutenantsirmontanosir
 help mastershere's a goodly watch indeed
 bell rings
 who's that which rings the belldiablo ho
 the town will rise god's will lieutenant hold
 you will be shamed for ever
 reenter othello and attendants
othello what is the matter here
montano zounds i bleed still i am hurt to the death
 faints
othello hold for your lives
iago hold ho lieutenantsirmontanogentlemen
 have you forgot all sense of place and duty
 hold the general speaks to you hold hold for shame
othello why how now ho from whence ariseth this
 are we turn'd turks and to ourselves do that
 which heaven hath forbid the ottomites
 for christian shame put by this barbarous brawl
 he that stirs next to carve for his own rage
 holds his soul light he dies upon his motion
 silence that dreadful bell it frights the isle
 from her propriety what is the matter masters
 honest iago that look'st dead with grieving
 speak who began this on thy love i charge thee
iago i do not know friends all but now even now
 in quarter and in terms like bride and groom
 devesting them for bed and then but now
 as if some planet had unwitted men
 swords out and tilting one at other's breast
 in opposition bloody i cannot speak
 any beginning to this peevish odds
 and would in action glorious i had lost
 those legs that brought me to a part of it
othello how comes it michael you are thus forgot
cassio i pray you pardon me i cannot speak
othello worthy montano you were wont be civil
 the gravity and stillness of your youth
 the world hath noted and your name is great
 in mouths of wisest censure what's the matter
 that you unlace your reputation thus
 and spend your rich opinion for the name
 of a nightbrawler give me answer to it
montano worthy othello i am hurt to danger
 your officer iago can inform you
 while i spare speech which something now
 offends me
 of all that i do know nor know i aught
 by me that's said or done amiss this night
 unless selfcharity be sometimes a vice
 and to defend ourselves it be a sin
 when violence assails us
othello now by heaven
 my blood begins my safer guides to rule
 and passion having my best judgment collied
 assays to lead the way if i once stir
 or do but lift this arm the best of you
 shall sink in my rebuke give me to know
 how this foul rout began who set it on
 and he that is approved in this offence
 though he had twinn'd with me both at a birth
 shall lose me what in a town of war
 yet wild the people's hearts brimful of fear
 to manage private and domestic quarrel
 in night and on the court and guard of safety
 tis monstrous iago who began't
montano if partially affined or leagued in office
 thou dost deliver more or less than truth
 thou art no soldier
