and in a peaceful hour doth cry kill kill'
distempering gentle love in his desire
as air and water do abate the fire
'this sour informer this batebreeding spy
this canker that eats up love's tender spring
this carrytale dissentious jealousy
that sometime true news sometime false doth bring
knocks at my heat and whispers in mine ear
that if i love thee i thy death should fear
'and more than so presenteth to mine eye
the picture of an angrychafing boar
under whose sharp fangs on his back doth lie
an image like thyself all stain'd with gore
whose blood upon the fresh flowers being shed
doth make them droop with grief and hang the head
'what should i do seeing thee so indeed
that tremble at the imagination
the thought of it doth make my faint heart bleed
and fear doth teach it divination
i prophesy thy death my living sorrow
if thou encounter with the boar tomorrow
'but if thou needs wilt hunt be ruled by me
uncouple at the timorous flying hare
or at the fox which lives by subtlety
or at the roe which no encounter dare
pursue these fearful creatures o'er the downs
and on thy wellbreath'd horse keep with thy
hounds
'and when thou hast on foot the purblind hare
mark the poor wretch to overshoot his troubles
how he outruns the wind and with what care
he cranks and crosses with a thousand doubles
the many musets through the which he goes
are like a labyrinth to amaze his foes
'sometime he runs among a flock of sheep
to make the cunning hounds mistake their smell
and sometime where earthdelving conies keep
to stop the loud pursuers in their yell
and sometime sorteth with a herd of deer
danger deviseth shifts wit waits on fear
'for there his smell with others being mingled
the hot scentsnuffing hounds are driven to doubt
ceasing their clamorous cry till they have singled
with much ado the cold fault cleanly out
then do they spend their mouths echo replies
as if another chase were in the skies
'by this poor wat far off upon a hill
stands on his hinder legs with listening ear
to harken if his foes pursue him still
anon their loud alarums he doth hear
and now his grief may be compared well
to one sore sick that hears the passingbell
'then shalt thou see the dewbedabbled wretch
turn and return indenting with the way
each envious brier his weary legs doth scratch
each shadow makes him stop each murmur stay
for misery is trodden on by many
and being low never relieved by any
'lie quietly and hear a little more
nay do not struggle for thou shalt not rise
to make thee hate the hunting of the boar
unlike myself thou hear'st me moralize
applying this to that and so to so
for love can comment upon every woe
'where did i leave no matter where quoth he
'leave me and then the story aptly ends
the night is spent why what of that quoth she
'i am quoth he expected of my friends
and now tis dark and going i shall fall'
'in night quoth she desire sees best of all
'but if thou fall o then imagine this
the earth in love with thee thy footing trips
and all is but to rob thee of a kiss
rich preys make true men thieves so do thy lips
make modest dian cloudy and forlorn
lest she should steal a kiss and die forsworn
'now of this dark night i perceive the reason
cynthia for shame obscures her silver shine
till forging nature be condemn'd of treason
for stealing moulds from heaven that were divine
wherein she framed thee in high heaven's despite
to shame the sun by day and her by night
'and therefore hath she bribed the destinies
to cross the curious workmanship of nature
to mingle beauty with infirmities
and pure perfection with impure defeature
making it subject to the tyranny
of mad mischances and much misery
'as burning fevers agues pale and faint
lifepoisoning pestilence and frenzies wood
the marroweating sickness whose attaint
disorder breeds by heating of the blood
surfeits imposthumes grief and damn'd despair
swear nature's death for framing thee so fair
'and not the least of all these maladies
but in one minute's fight brings beauty under
both favour savour hue and qualities
whereat the impartial gazer late did wonder
are on the sudden wasted thaw'd and done
as mountainsnow melts with the midday sun
'therefore despite of fruitless chastity
lovelacking vestals and selfloving nuns
that on the earth would breed a scarcity
and barren dearth of daughters and of sons
be prodigal the lamp that burns by night
dries up his oil to lend the world his light
'what is thy body but a swallowing grave
seeming to bury that posterity
which by the rights of time thou needs must have
if thou destroy them not in dark obscurity
if so the world will hold thee in disdain
sith in thy pride so fair a hope is slain
'so in thyself thyself art made away
a mischief worse than civil homebred strife
or theirs whose desperate hands themselves do slay
or butchersire that reaves his son of life
foulcankering rust the hidden treasure frets
but gold that's put to use more gold begets'
'nay then quoth adon you will fall again
into your idle overhandled theme
the kiss i gave you is bestow'd in vain
and all in vain you strive against the stream
for by this blackfaced night desire's foul nurse
your treatise makes me like you worse and worse
'if love have lent you twenty thousand tongues
and every tongue more moving than your own
bewitching like the wanton mermaid's songs
yet from mine ear the tempting tune is blown
for know my heart stands armed in mine ear
and will not let a false sound enter there
'lest the deceiving harmony should run
into the quiet closure of my breast
and then my little heart were quite undone
in his bedchamber to be barr'd of rest
no lady no my heart longs not to groan
but soundly sleeps while now it sleeps alone
'what have you urged that i cannot reprove
the path is smooth that leadeth on to danger
i hate not love but your device in love
that lends embracements unto every stranger
you do it for increase o strange excuse
when reason is the bawd to lust's abuse
'call it not love for love to heaven is fled
since sweating lust on earth usurp'd his name
under whose simple semblance he hath fed
upon fresh beauty blotting it with blame
which the hot tyrant stains and soon bereaves
as caterpillars do the tender leaves
'love comforteth like sunshine after rain
but lust's effect is tempest after sun
love's gentle spring doth always fresh remain
lust's winter comes ere summer half be done
love surfeits not lust like a glutton dies
love is all truth lust full of forged lies
'more i could tell but more i dare not say
the text is old the orator too green
therefore in sadness now i will away
my face is full of shame my heart of teen
mine ears that to your wanton talk attended
do burn themselves for having so offended'
with this he breaketh from the sweet embrace
of those fair arms which bound him to her breast
and homeward through the dark laund runs apace
leaves love upon her back deeply distress'd
look how a bright star shooteth from the sky
so glides he in the night from venus eye
which after him she darts as one on shore
gazing upon a lateembarked friend
till the wild waves will have him seen no more
whose ridges with the meeting clouds contend
so did the merciless and pitchy night
fold in the object that did feed her sight
whereat amazed as one that unaware
hath dropp'd a precious jewel in the flood
or stonish'd as nightwanderers often are
their light blown out in some mistrustful wood
even so confounded in the dark she lay
having lost the fair discovery of her way
and now she beats her heart whereat it groans
that all the neighbour caves as seeming troubled
make verbal repetition of her moans
passion on passion deeply is redoubled
'ay me she cries and twenty times woe woe'
and twenty echoes twenty times cry so
she marking them begins a wailing note
and sings extemporally a woeful ditty
how love makes young men thrall and old men dote
how love is wise in folly foolishwitty
her heavy anthem still concludes in woe
and still the choir of echoes answer so
her song was tedious and outwore the night
for lovers hours are long though seeming short
if pleased themselves others they think delight
in suchlike circumstance with suchlike sport
their copious stories oftentimes begun
end without audience and are never done
for who hath she to spend the night withal
but idle sounds resembling parasites
like shrilltongued tapsters answering every call
soothing the humour of fantastic wits
