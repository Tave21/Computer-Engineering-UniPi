 come mistress kate i'll bear you company
petruchio aside eat it up all hortensio if thou lovest me
 much good do it unto thy gentle heart
 kate eat apace and now my honey love
 will we return unto thy father's house
 and revel it as bravely as the best
 with silken coats and caps and golden rings
 with ruffs and cuffs and fardingales and things
 with scarfs and fans and double change of bravery
 with amber bracelets beads and all this knavery
 what hast thou dined the tailor stays thy leisure
 to deck thy body with his ruffling treasure
 enter tailor
 come tailor let us see these ornaments
 lay forth the gown
 enter haberdasher
 what news with you sir
haberdasher here is the cap your worship did bespeak
petruchio why this was moulded on a porringer
 a velvet dish fie fie tis lewd and filthy
 why tis a cockle or a walnutshell
 a knack a toy a trick a baby's cap
 away with it come let me have a bigger
katharina i'll have no bigger this doth fit the time
 and gentlewomen wear such caps as these
petruchio when you are gentle you shall have one too
 and not till then
hortensio aside that will not be in haste
katharina why sir i trust i may have leave to speak
 and speak i will i am no child no babe
 your betters have endured me say my mind
 and if you cannot best you stop your ears
 my tongue will tell the anger of my heart
 or else my heart concealing it will break
 and rather than it shall i will be free
 even to the uttermost as i please in words
petruchio why thou say'st true it is a paltry cap
 a custardcoffin a bauble a silken pie
 i love thee well in that thou likest it not
katharina love me or love me not i like the cap
 and it i will have or i will have none
 exit haberdasher
petruchio thy gown why ay come tailor let us see't
 o mercy god what masquing stuff is here
 what's this a sleeve tis like a demicannon
 what up and down carved like an appletart
 here's snip and nip and cut and slish and slash
 like to a censer in a barber's shop
 why what i devil's name tailor call'st thou this
hortensio aside i see she's like to have neither cap nor gown
tailor you bid me make it orderly and well
 according to the fashion and the time
petruchio marry and did but if you be remember'd
 i did not bid you mar it to the time
 go hop me over every kennel home
 for you shall hop without my custom sir
 i'll none of it hence make your best of it
katharina i never saw a betterfashion'd gown
 more quaint more pleasing nor more commendable
 belike you mean to make a puppet of me
petruchio why true he means to make a puppet of thee
tailor she says your worship means to make
 a puppet of her
petruchio o monstrous arrogance thou liest thou thread
 thou thimble
 thou yard threequarters halfyard quarter nail
 thou flea thou nit thou wintercricket thou
 braved in mine own house with a skein of thread
 away thou rag thou quantity thou remnant
 or i shall so bemete thee with thy yard
 as thou shalt think on prating whilst thou livest
 i tell thee i that thou hast marr'd her gown
tailor your worship is deceived the gown is made
 just as my master had direction
 grumio gave order how it should be done
grumio i gave him no order i gave him the stuff
tailor but how did you desire it should be made
grumio marry sir with needle and thread
tailor but did you not request to have it cut
grumio thou hast faced many things
tailor i have
grumio face not me thou hast braved many men brave not
 me i will neither be faced nor braved i say unto
 thee i bid thy master cut out the gown but i did
 not bid him cut it to pieces ergo thou liest
tailor why here is the note of the fashion to testify
petruchio read it
grumio the note lies in's throat if he say i said so
tailor reads imprimis a loosebodied gown'
grumio master if ever i said loosebodied gown sew me in
 the skirts of it and beat me to death with a bottom
 of brown thread i said a gown
petruchio proceed
tailor reads with a small compassed cape'
grumio i confess the cape
tailor reads with a trunk sleeve'
grumio i confess two sleeves
tailor reads the sleeves curiously cut'
petruchio ay there's the villany
grumio error i the bill sir error i the bill
 i commanded the sleeves should be cut out and
 sewed up again and that i'll prove upon thee
 though thy little finger be armed in a thimble
tailor this is true that i say an i had thee
 in place where thou shouldst know it
grumio i am for thee straight take thou the
 bill give me thy meteyard and spare not me
hortensio godamercy grumio then he shall have no odds
petruchio well sir in brief the gown is not for me
grumio you are i the right sir tis for my mistress
petruchio go take it up unto thy master's use
grumio villain not for thy life take up my mistress'
 gown for thy master's use
petruchio why sir what's your conceit in that
grumio o sir the conceit is deeper than you think for
 take up my mistress gown to his master's use
 o fie fie fie
petruchio aside hortensio say thou wilt see the tailor paid
 go take it hence be gone and say no more
hortensio tailor i'll pay thee for thy gown tomorrow
 take no unkindness of his hasty words
 away i say commend me to thy master
 exit tailor
petruchio well come my kate we will unto your father's
 even in these honest mean habiliments
 our purses shall be proud our garments poor
 for tis the mind that makes the body rich
 and as the sun breaks through the darkest clouds
 so honour peereth in the meanest habit
 what is the jay more precious than the lark
 because his fathers are more beautiful
 or is the adder better than the eel
 because his painted skin contents the eye
 o no good kate neither art thou the worse
 for this poor furniture and mean array
 if thou account'st it shame lay it on me
 and therefore frolic we will hence forthwith
 to feast and sport us at thy father's house
 go call my men and let us straight to him
 and bring our horses unto longlane end
 there will we mount and thither walk on foot
 let's see i think tis now some seven o'clock
 and well we may come there by dinnertime
katharina i dare assure you sir tis almost two
 and twill be suppertime ere you come there
petruchio it shall be seven ere i go to horse
 look what i speak or do or think to do
 you are still crossing it sirs let't alone
 i will not go today and ere i do
 it shall be what o'clock i say it is
hortensio aside why so this gallant will command the sun
 exeunt
 the taming of the shrew
