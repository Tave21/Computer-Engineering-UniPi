 my heart's deep languor and my soul's sad tears
 let my tears stanch the earth's dry appetite
 my sons sweet blood will make it shame and blush
 o earth i will befriend thee more with rain
 that shall distil from these two ancient urns
 than youthful april shall with all his showers
 in summer's drought i'll drop upon thee still
 in winter with warm tears i'll melt the snow
 and keep eternal springtime on thy face
 so thou refuse to drink my dear sons blood
 enter lucius with his sword drawn
 o reverend tribunes o gentle aged men
 unbind my sons reverse the doom of death
 and let me say that never wept before
 my tears are now prevailing orators
lucius o noble father you lament in vain
 the tribunes hear you not no man is by
 and you recount your sorrows to a stone
titus andronicus ah lucius for thy brothers let me plead
 grave tribunes once more i entreat of you
lucius my gracious lord no tribune hears you speak
titus andronicus why tis no matter man if they did hear
 they would not mark me or if they did mark
 they would not pity me yet plead i must
 and bootless unto them 
 therefore i tell my sorrows to the stones
 who though they cannot answer my distress
 yet in some sort they are better than the tribunes
 for that they will not intercept my tale
 when i do weep they humbly at my feet
 receive my tears and seem to weep with me
 and were they but attired in grave weeds
 rome could afford no tribune like to these
 a stone is soft as waxtribunes more hard than stones
 a stone is silent and offendeth not
 and tribunes with their tongues doom men to death
 rises
 but wherefore stand'st thou with thy weapon drawn
lucius to rescue my two brothers from their death
 for which attempt the judges have pronounced
 my everlasting doom of banishment
titus andronicus o happy man they have befriended thee
 why foolish lucius dost thou not perceive
 that rome is but a wilderness of tigers
 tigers must prey and rome affords no prey
 but me and mine how happy art thou then
 from these devourers to be banished
 but who comes with our brother marcus here
 enter marcus and lavinia
marcus andronicus titus prepare thy aged eyes to weep
 or if not so thy noble heart to break
 i bring consuming sorrow to thine age
titus andronicus will it consume me let me see it then
marcus andronicus this was thy daughter
titus andronicus why marcus so she is
lucius ay me this object kills me
titus andronicus fainthearted boy arise and look upon her
 speak lavinia what accursed hand
 hath made thee handless in thy father's sight
 what fool hath added water to the sea
 or brought a faggot to brightburning troy
 my grief was at the height before thou camest
 and now like nilus it disdaineth bounds
 give me a sword i'll chop off my hands too
 for they have fought for rome and all in vain
 and they have nursed this woe in feeding life
 in bootless prayer have they been held up
 and they have served me to effectless use
 now all the service i require of them
 is that the one will help to cut the other
 tis well lavinia that thou hast no hands
 for hands to do rome service are but vain
lucius speak gentle sister who hath martyr'd thee
marcus andronicus o that delightful engine of her thoughts
 that blabb'd them with such pleasing eloquence
 is torn from forth that pretty hollow cage
 where like a sweet melodious bird it sung
 sweet varied notes enchanting every ear
lucius o say thou for her who hath done this deed
marcus andronicus o thus i found her straying in the park
 seeking to hide herself as doth the deer
 that hath received some unrecuring wound
titus andronicus it was my deer and he that wounded her
 hath hurt me more than had he killed me dead
 for now i stand as one upon a rock
 environed with a wilderness of sea
 who marks the waxing tide grow wave by wave
 expecting ever when some envious surge
 will in his brinish bowels swallow him
 this way to death my wretched sons are gone
 here stands my other son a banished man
 and here my brother weeping at my woes
 but that which gives my soul the greatest spurn
 is dear lavinia dearer than my soul
 had i but seen thy picture in this plight
 it would have madded me what shall i do
 now i behold thy lively body so
 thou hast no hands to wipe away thy tears
 nor tongue to tell me who hath martyr'd thee
 thy husband he is dead and for his death
 thy brothers are condemn'd and dead by this
 look marcus ah son lucius look on her
 when i did name her brothers then fresh tears
 stood on her cheeks as doth the honeydew
 upon a gather'd lily almost wither'd
marcus andronicus perchance she weeps because they kill'd her husband
 perchance because she knows them innocent
titus andronicus if they did kill thy husband then be joyful
 because the law hath ta'en revenge on them
 no no they would not do so foul a deed
 witness the sorrow that their sister makes
 gentle lavinia let me kiss thy lips
 or make some sign how i may do thee ease
 shall thy good uncle and thy brother lucius
 and thou and i sit round about some fountain
 looking all downwards to behold our cheeks
 how they are stain'd as meadows yet not dry
 with miry slime left on them by a flood
 and in the fountain shall we gaze so long
 till the fresh taste be taken from that clearness
 and made a brinepit with our bitter tears
 or shall we cut away our hands like thine
 or shall we bite our tongues and in dumb shows
 pass the remainder of our hateful days
 what shall we do let us that have our tongues
 plot some deuce of further misery
 to make us wonder'd at in time to come
lucius sweet father cease your tears for at your grief
 see how my wretched sister sobs and weeps
marcus andronicus patience dear niece good titus dry thine eyes
titus andronicus ah marcus marcus brother well i wot
 thy napkin cannot drink a tear of mine
 for thou poor man hast drown'd it with thine own
lucius ah my lavinia i will wipe thy cheeks
titus andronicus mark marcus mark i understand her signs
 had she a tongue to speak now would she say
 that to her brother which i said to thee
 his napkin with his true tears all bewet
 can do no service on her sorrowful cheeks
 o what a sympathy of woe is this
 as far from help as limbo is from bliss
 enter aaron
aaron titus andronicus my lord the emperor
 sends thee this wordthat if thou love thy sons
 let marcus lucius or thyself old titus
 or any one of you chop off your hand
 and send it to the king he for the same
 will send thee hither both thy sons alive
 and that shall be the ransom for their fault
titus andronicus o gracious emperor o gentle aaron
 did ever raven sing so like a lark
 that gives sweet tidings of the sun's uprise
 with all my heart i'll send the emperor my hand
 good aaron wilt thou help to chop it off
lucius stay father for that noble hand of thine
 that hath thrown down so many enemies
 shall not be sent my hand will serve the turn
 my youth can better spare my blood than you
 and therefore mine shall save my brothers lives
marcus andronicus which of your hands hath not defended rome
 and rear'd aloft the bloody battleaxe
 writing destruction on the enemy's castle
 o none of both but are of high desert
 my hand hath been but idle let it serve
 to ransom my two nephews from their death
 then have i kept it to a worthy end
aaron nay come agree whose hand shall go along
 for fear they die before their pardon come
marcus andronicus my hand shall go
lucius by heaven it shall not go
titus andronicus sirs strive no more such wither'd herbs as these
 are meet for plucking up and therefore mine
lucius sweet father if i shall be thought thy son
 let me redeem my brothers both from death
marcus andronicus and for our father's sake and mother's care
 now let me show a brother's love to thee
titus andronicus agree between you i will spare my hand
lucius then i'll go fetch an axe
marcus andronicus but i will use the axe
 exeunt lucius and marcus
titus andronicus come hither aaron i'll deceive them both
 lend me thy hand and i will give thee mine
aaron aside if that be call'd deceit i will be honest
 and never whilst i live deceive men so
 but i'll deceive you in another sort
 and that you'll say ere half an hour pass
 cuts off titus's hand
 reenter lucius and marcus
titus andronicus now stay your strife what shall be is dispatch'd
 good aaron give his majesty my hand
 tell him it was a hand that warded him
 from thousand dangers bid him bury it
 more hath it merited that let it have
 as for my sons say i account of them
 as jewels purchased at an easy price
 and yet dear too because i bought mine own
aaron i go andronicus and for thy hand
 look by and by to have thy sons with thee
 aside
 their heads i mean o how this villany
