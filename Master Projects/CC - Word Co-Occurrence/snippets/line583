 give me a note your ladyship can set
julia as little by such toys as may be possible
 best sing it to the tune of light o love'
lucetta it is too heavy for so light a tune
julia heavy belike it hath some burden then
lucetta ay and melodious were it would you sing it
julia and why not you
lucetta i cannot reach so high
julia let's see your song how now minion
lucetta keep tune there still so you will sing it out
 and yet methinks i do not like this tune
julia you do not
lucetta no madam it is too sharp
julia you minion are too saucy
lucetta nay now you are too flat
 and mar the concord with too harsh a descant
 there wanteth but a mean to fill your song
julia the mean is drown'd with your unruly bass
lucetta indeed i bid the base for proteus
julia this babble shall not henceforth trouble me
 here is a coil with protestation
 tears the letter
 go get you gone and let the papers lie
 you would be fingering them to anger me
lucetta she makes it strange but she would be best pleased
 to be so anger'd with another letter
 exit
julia nay would i were so anger'd with the same
 o hateful hands to tear such loving words
 injurious wasps to feed on such sweet honey
 and kill the bees that yield it with your stings
 i'll kiss each several paper for amends
 look here is writ kind julia unkind julia
 as in revenge of thy ingratitude
 i throw thy name against the bruising stones
 trampling contemptuously on thy disdain
 and here is writ lovewounded proteus'
 poor wounded name my bosom as a bed
 shall lodge thee till thy wound be thoroughly heal'd
 and thus i search it with a sovereign kiss
 but twice or thrice was proteus written down
 be calm good wind blow not a word away
 till i have found each letter in the letter
 except mine own name that some whirlwind bear
 unto a ragged fearfulhanging rock
 and throw it thence into the raging sea
 lo here in one line is his name twice writ
 poor forlorn proteus passionate proteus
 to the sweet julia that i'll tear away
 and yet i will not sith so prettily
 he couples it to his complaining names
 thus will i fold them one on another
 now kiss embrace contend do what you will
 reenter lucetta
lucetta madam
 dinner is ready and your father stays
julia well let us go
lucetta what shall these papers lie like telltales here
julia if you respect them best to take them up
lucetta nay i was taken up for laying them down
 yet here they shall not lie for catching cold
julia i see you have a month's mind to them
lucetta ay madam you may say what sights you see
 i see things too although you judge i wink
julia come come will't please you go

act i
scene iii the same antonio's house
 enter antonio and panthino
antonio tell me panthino what sad talk was that
 wherewith my brother held you in the cloister
panthino twas of his nephew proteus your son
antonio why what of him
panthino he wonder'd that your lordship
 would suffer him to spend his youth at home
 while other men of slender reputation
 put forth their sons to seek preferment out
 some to the wars to try their fortune there
 some to discover islands far away
 some to the studious universities
 for any or for all these exercises
 he said that proteus your son was meet
 and did request me to importune you
 to let him spend his time no more at home
 which would be great impeachment to his age
 in having known no travel in his youth
antonio nor need'st thou much importune me to that
 whereon this month i have been hammering
 i have consider'd well his loss of time
 and how he cannot be a perfect man
 not being tried and tutor'd in the world
 experience is by industry achieved
 and perfected by the swift course of time
 then tell me whither were i best to send him
panthino i think your lordship is not ignorant
 how his companion youthful valentine
 attends the emperor in his royal court
antonio i know it well
panthino twere good i think your lordship sent him thither
 there shall he practise tilts and tournaments
 hear sweet discourse converse with noblemen
 and be in eye of every exercise
 worthy his youth and nobleness of birth
antonio i like thy counsel well hast thou advised
 and that thou mayst perceive how well i like it
 the execution of it shall make known
 even with the speediest expedition
 i will dispatch him to the emperor's court
panthino tomorrow may it please you don alphonso
 with other gentlemen of good esteem
 are journeying to salute the emperor
 and to commend their service to his will
antonio good company with them shall proteus go
 and in good time now will we break with him
 enter proteus
proteus sweet love sweet lines sweet life
 here is her hand the agent of her heart
 here is her oath for love her honour's pawn
 o that our fathers would applaud our loves
 to seal our happiness with their consents
 o heavenly julia
antonio how now what letter are you reading there
proteus may't please your lordship tis a word or two
 of commendations sent from valentine
 deliver'd by a friend that came from him
antonio lend me the letter let me see what news
proteus there is no news my lord but that he writes
 how happily he lives how well beloved
 and daily graced by the emperor
 wishing me with him partner of his fortune
antonio and how stand you affected to his wish
proteus as one relying on your lordship's will
 and not depending on his friendly wish
antonio my will is something sorted with his wish
 muse not that i thus suddenly proceed
 for what i will i will and there an end
 i am resolved that thou shalt spend some time
 with valentinus in the emperor's court
 what maintenance he from his friends receives
 like exhibition thou shalt have from me
 tomorrow be in readiness to go
 excuse it not for i am peremptory
proteus my lord i cannot be so soon provided
 please you deliberate a day or two
antonio look what thou want'st shall be sent after thee
 no more of stay tomorrow thou must go
 come on panthino you shall be employ'd
 to hasten on his expedition
 exeunt antonio and panthino
proteus thus have i shunn'd the fire for fear of burning
 and drench'd me in the sea where i am drown'd
 i fear'd to show my father julia's letter
 lest he should take exceptions to my love
 and with the vantage of mine own excuse
 hath he excepted most against my love
 o how this spring of love resembleth
 the uncertain glory of an april day
 which now shows all the beauty of the sun
 and by and by a cloud takes all away
 reenter panthino
panthino sir proteus your father calls for you
 he is in haste therefore i pray you to go
proteus why this it is my heart accords thereto
 and yet a thousand times it answers no'

 the pestilence to sigh like a schoolboy that had
 lost his a b c to weep like a young wench that had
 buried her grandam to fast like one that takes
 diet to watch like one that fears robbing to
 speak puling like a beggar at hallowmas you were
 wont when you laughed to crow like a cock when you
 walked to walk like one of the lions when you
 fasted it was presently after dinner when you
 looked sadly it was for want of money and now you
 are metamorphosed with a mistress that when i look
