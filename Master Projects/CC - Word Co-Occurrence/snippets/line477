 that i have a kind of alacrity in sinking if the
 bottom were as deep as hell i should down i had
 been drowned but that the shore was shelvy and
 shallowa death that i abhor for the water swells
 a man and what a thing should i have been when i
 had been swelled i should have been a mountain of mummy

 enter ford
ford bless you sir
falstaff now master brook you come to know what hath passed
 between me and ford's wife
ford that indeed sir john is my business
falstaff master brook i will not lie to you i was at her
 house the hour she appointed me
ford and sped you sir
falstaff very illfavoredly master brook
ford how so sir did she change her determination
falstaff no master brook but the peaking cornuto her
 husband master brook dwelling in a continual
 larum of jealousy comes me in the instant of our
 encounter after we had embraced kissed protested
 and as it were spoke the prologue of our comedy
 and at his heels a rabble of his companions thither
 provoked and instigated by his distemper and
 forsooth to search his house for his wife's love
ford what while you were there
falstaff while i was there
ford and did he search for you and could not find you
falstaff you shall hear as good luck would have it comes
 in one mistress page gives intelligence of ford's
 approach and in her invention and ford's wife's
 distraction they conveyed me into a buckbasket
ford a buckbasket
falstaff by the lord a buckbasket rammed me in with foul
 shirts and smocks socks foul stockings greasy
 napkins that master brook there was the rankest
 compound of villanous smell that ever offended nostril
ford and how long lay you there
falstaff nay you shall hear master brook what i have
 suffered to bring this woman to evil for your good
 being thus crammed in the basket a couple of ford's
 knaves his hinds were called forth by their
 mistress to carry me in the name of foul clothes to
 datchetlane they took me on their shoulders met
 the jealous knave their master in the door who
 asked them once or twice what they had in their
 basket i quaked for fear lest the lunatic knave
 would have searched it but fate ordaining he
 should be a cuckold held his hand well on went he
 for a search and away went i for foul clothes but
 mark the sequel master brook i suffered the pangs
 of three several deaths first an intolerable
 fright to be detected with a jealous rotten
 bellwether next to be compassed like a good
 bilbo in the circumference of a peck hilt to
 point heel to head and then to be stopped in
 like a strong distillation with stinking clothes
 that fretted in their own grease think of thata
 man of my kidneythink of thatthat am as subject
 to heat as butter a man of continual dissolution
 and thaw it was a miracle to scape suffocation
 and in the height of this bath when i was more than
 half stewed in grease like a dutch dish to be
 thrown into the thames and cooled glowing hot
 in that surge like a horseshoe think of
 thathissing hotthink of that master brook
ford in good sadness i am sorry that for my sake you
 have sufferd all this my suit then is desperate
 you'll undertake her no more
falstaff master brook i will be thrown into etna as i have
 been into thames ere i will leave her thus her
 husband is this morning gone abirding i have
 received from her another embassy of meeting twixt
 eight and nine is the hour master brook
ford tis past eight already sir
falstaff is it i will then address me to my appointment
 come to me at your convenient leisure and you shall
 know how i speed and the conclusion shall be
 crowned with your enjoying her adieu you shall
 have her master brook master brook you shall
 cuckold ford
 exit
ford hum ha is this a vision is this a dream do i
 sleep master ford awake awake master ford
 there's a hole made in your best coat master ford
 this tis to be married this tis to have linen
 and buckbaskets well i will proclaim myself
 what i am i will now take the lecher he is at my
 house he cannot scape me tis impossible he
 should he cannot creep into a halfpenny purse
 nor into a pepperbox but lest the devil that
 guides him should aid him i will search
 impossible places though what i am i cannot avoid
 yet to be what i would not shall not make me tame
 if i have horns to make one mad let the proverb go
 with me i'll be hornmad
