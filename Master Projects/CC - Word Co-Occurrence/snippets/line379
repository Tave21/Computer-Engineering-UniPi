touchstone the more pity that fools may not speak wisely what
 wise men do foolishly
celia by my troth thou sayest true for since the little
 wit that fools have was silenced the little foolery
 that wise men have makes a great show here comes
 monsieur le beau
rosalind with his mouth full of news
celia which he will put on us as pigeons feed their young
rosalind then shall we be newscrammed
celia all the better we shall be the more marketable
 enter le beau
 bon jour monsieur le beau what's the news
le beau fair princess you have lost much good sport
celia sport of what colour
le beau what colour madam how shall i answer you
rosalind as wit and fortune will
touchstone or as the destinies decree
celia well said that was laid on with a trowel
touchstone nay if i keep not my rank
rosalind thou losest thy old smell
le beau you amaze me ladies i would have told you of good
 wrestling which you have lost the sight of
rosalind you tell us the manner of the wrestling
le beau i will tell you the beginning and if it please
 your ladyships you may see the end for the best is
 yet to do and here where you are they are coming
 to perform it
celia well the beginning that is dead and buried
le beau there comes an old man and his three sons
celia i could match this beginning with an old tale
le beau three proper young men of excellent growth and presence
rosalind with bills on their necks be it known unto all men
 by these presents'
le beau the eldest of the three wrestled with charles the
 duke's wrestler which charles in a moment threw him
 and broke three of his ribs that there is little
 hope of life in him so he served the second and
 so the third yonder they lie the poor old man
 their father making such pitiful dole over them
 that all the beholders take his part with weeping
rosalind alas
touchstone but what is the sport monsieur that the ladies
 have lost
le beau why this that i speak of
touchstone thus men may grow wiser every day it is the first
 time that ever i heard breaking of ribs was sport
 for ladies
celia or i i promise thee
rosalind but is there any else longs to see this broken music
 in his sides is there yet another dotes upon
 ribbreaking shall we see this wrestling cousin
le beau you must if you stay here for here is the place
 appointed for the wrestling and they are ready to
 perform it
celia yonder sure they are coming let us now stay and see it
 flourish enter duke frederick lords orlando
 charles and attendants
duke frederick come on since the youth will not be entreated his
 own peril on his forwardness
rosalind is yonder the man
le beau even he madam
celia alas he is too young yet he looks successfully
duke frederick how now daughter and cousin are you crept hither
 to see the wrestling
rosalind ay my liege so please you give us leave
duke frederick you will take little delight in it i can tell you
 there is such odds in the man in pity of the
 challenger's youth i would fain dissuade him but he
 will not be entreated speak to him ladies see if
 you can move him
celia call him hither good monsieur le beau
duke frederick do so i'll not be by
le beau monsieur the challenger the princesses call for you
orlando i attend them with all respect and duty
rosalind young man have you challenged charles the wrestler
orlando no fair princess he is the general challenger i
 come but in as others do to try with him the
 strength of my youth
celia young gentleman your spirits are too bold for your
 years you have seen cruel proof of this man's
 strength if you saw yourself with your eyes or
 knew yourself with your judgment the fear of your
 adventure would counsel you to a more equal
 enterprise we pray you for your own sake to
 embrace your own safety and give over this attempt
rosalind do young sir your reputation shall not therefore
 be misprised we will make it our suit to the duke
 that the wrestling might not go forward
orlando i beseech you punish me not with your hard
 thoughts wherein i confess me much guilty to deny
 so fair and excellent ladies any thing but let
 your fair eyes and gentle wishes go with me to my
 trial wherein if i be foiled there is but one
 shamed that was never gracious if killed but one
 dead that was willing to be so i shall do my
 friends no wrong for i have none to lament me the
 world no injury for in it i have nothing only in
 the world i fill up a place which may be better
 supplied when i have made it empty
rosalind the little strength that i have i would it were with you
celia and mine to eke out hers
rosalind fare you well pray heaven i be deceived in you
celia your heart's desires be with you
charles come where is this young gallant that is so
 desirous to lie with his mother earth
orlando ready sir but his will hath in it a more modest working
duke frederick you shall try but one fall
charles no i warrant your grace you shall not entreat him
 to a second that have so mightily persuaded him
 from a first
orlando an you mean to mock me after you should not have
 mocked me before but come your ways
rosalind now hercules be thy speed young man
celia i would i were invisible to catch the strong
 fellow by the leg
 they wrestle
rosalind o excellent young man
celia if i had a thunderbolt in mine eye i can tell who
 should down
 shout charles is thrown
duke frederick no more no more
orlando yes i beseech your grace i am not yet well breathed
duke frederick how dost thou charles
le beau he cannot speak my lord
duke frederick bear him away what is thy name young man
orlando orlando my liege the youngest son of sir rowland de boys
duke frederick i would thou hadst been son to some man else
 the world esteem'd thy father honourable
 but i did find him still mine enemy
 thou shouldst have better pleased me with this deed
 hadst thou descended from another house
 but fare thee well thou art a gallant youth
 i would thou hadst told me of another father
 exeunt duke frederick train and le beau
celia were i my father coz would i do this
orlando i am more proud to be sir rowland's son
 his youngest son and would not change that calling
 to be adopted heir to frederick
rosalind my father loved sir rowland as his soul
 and all the world was of my father's mind
 had i before known this young man his son
 i should have given him tears unto entreaties
 ere he should thus have ventured
celia gentle cousin
 let us go thank him and encourage him
 my father's rough and envious disposition
 sticks me at heart sir you have well deserved
 if you do keep your promises in love
 but justly as you have exceeded all promise
 your mistress shall be happy
rosalind gentleman
 giving him a chain from her neck
 wear this for me one out of suits with fortune
 that could give more but that her hand lacks means
 shall we go coz
celia ay fare you well fair gentleman
orlando can i not say i thank you my better parts
 are all thrown down and that which here stands up
 is but a quintain a mere lifeless block
rosalind he calls us back my pride fell with my fortunes
 i'll ask him what he would did you call sir
 sir you have wrestled well and overthrown
 more than your enemies
celia will you go coz
rosalind have with you fare you well
 exeunt rosalind and celia
orlando what passion hangs these weights upon my tongue
 i cannot speak to her yet she urged conference
 o poor orlando thou art overthrown
 or charles or something weaker masters thee
 reenter le beau
le beau good sir i do in friendship counsel you
 to leave this place albeit you have deserved
 high commendation true applause and love
 yet such is now the duke's condition
 that he misconstrues all that you have done
 the duke is humorous what he is indeed
 more suits you to conceive than i to speak of
orlando i thank you sir and pray you tell me this
 which of the two was daughter of the duke
 that here was at the wrestling
le beau neither his daughter if we judge by manners
 but yet indeed the lesser is his daughter
 the other is daughter to the banish'd duke
 and here detain'd by her usurping uncle
 to keep his daughter company whose loves
 are dearer than the natural bond of sisters
 but i can tell you that of late this duke
 hath ta'en displeasure gainst his gentle niece
 grounded upon no other argument
 but that the people praise her for her virtues
 and pity her for her good father's sake
 and on my life his malice gainst the lady
 will suddenly break forth sir fare you well
 hereafter in a better world than this
 i shall desire more love and knowledge of you
orlando i rest much bounden to you fare you well
 exit le beau
 thus must i from the smoke into the smother
 from tyrant duke unto a tyrant brother
