 enter fenton and host
host master fenton talk not to me my mind is heavy i
 will give over all
fenton yet hear me speak assist me in my purpose
 and as i am a gentleman i'll give thee
 a hundred pound in gold more than your loss
host i will hear you master fenton and i will at the
 least keep your counsel
fenton from time to time i have acquainted you
 with the dear love i bear to fair anne page
 who mutually hath answer'd my affection
 so far forth as herself might be her chooser
 even to my wish i have a letter from her
 of such contents as you will wonder at
 the mirth whereof so larded with my matter
 that neither singly can be manifested
 without the show of both fat falstaff
 hath a great scene the image of the jest
 i'll show you here at large hark good mine host
 tonight at herne's oak just twixt twelve and one
 must my sweet nan present the fairy queen
 the purpose why is here in which disguise
 while other jests are something rank on foot
 her father hath commanded her to slip
 away with slender and with him at eton
 immediately to marry she hath consented now sir
 her mother ever strong against that match
 and firm for doctor caius hath appointed
 that he shall likewise shuffle her away
 while other sports are tasking of their minds
 and at the deanery where a priest attends
 straight marry her to this her mother's plot
 she seemingly obedient likewise hath
 made promise to the doctor now thus it rests
 her father means she shall be all in white
 and in that habit when slender sees his time
 to take her by the hand and bid her go
 she shall go with him her mother hath intended
 the better to denote her to the doctor
 for they must all be mask'd and vizarded
 that quaint in green she shall be loose enrobed
 with ribands pendent flaring bout her head
 and when the doctor spies his vantage ripe
 to pinch her by the hand and on that token
 the maid hath given consent to go with him
host which means she to deceive father or mother
fenton both my good host to go along with me
 and here it rests that you'll procure the vicar
 to stay for me at church twixt twelve and one
 and in the lawful name of marrying
 to give our hearts united ceremony
host well husband your device i'll to the vicar
 bring you the maid you shall not lack a priest
fenton so shall i evermore be bound to thee
 besides i'll make a present recompense
