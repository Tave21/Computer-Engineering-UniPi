apemantus i will fly like a dog the heels o the ass
 exit
first lord he's opposite to humanity come shall we in
 and taste lord timon's bounty he outgoes
 the very heart of kindness
second lord he pours it out plutus the god of gold
 is but his steward no meed but he repays
 sevenfold above itself no gift to him
 but breeds the giver a return exceeding
 all use of quittance
first lord the noblest mind he carries
 that ever govern'd man
second lord long may he live in fortunes shall we in
first lord i'll keep you company
 exeunt
 timon of athens
act i
scene ii a banquetingroom in timon's house
 hautboys playing loud music a great banquet
 served in flavius and others attending then enter
 timon alcibiades lords senators and ventidius
 then comes dropping after all apemantus
 discontentedly like himself
ventidius most honour'd timon
 it hath pleased the gods to remember my father's age
 and call him to long peace
 he is gone happy and has left me rich
 then as in grateful virtue i am bound
 to your free heart i do return those talents
 doubled with thanks and service from whose help
 i derived liberty
timon o by no means
 honest ventidius you mistake my love
 i gave it freely ever and there's none
 can truly say he gives if he receives
 if our betters play at that game we must not dare
 to imitate them faults that are rich are fair
ventidius a noble spirit
timon nay my lords
 they all stand ceremoniously looking on timon
 ceremony was but devised at first
 to set a gloss on faint deeds hollow welcomes
 recanting goodness sorry ere tis shown
 but where there is true friendship there needs none
 pray sit more welcome are ye to my fortunes
 than my fortunes to me
 they sit
first lord my lord we always have confess'd it
apemantus ho ho confess'd it hang'd it have you not
timon o apemantus you are welcome
apemantus no
 you shall not make me welcome
 i come to have thee thrust me out of doors
timon fie thou'rt a churl ye've got a humour there
 does not become a man tis much to blame
 they say my lords ira furor brevis est but yond
 man is ever angry go let him have a table by
 himself for he does neither affect company nor is
 he fit for't indeed
apemantus let me stay at thine apperil timon i come to
 observe i give thee warning on't
timon i take no heed of thee thou'rt an athenian
 therefore welcome i myself would have no power
 prithee let my meat make thee silent
apemantus i scorn thy meat twould choke me for i should
 ne'er flatter thee o you gods what a number of
 men eat timon and he sees em not it grieves me
 to see so many dip their meat in one man's blood
 and all the madness is he cheers them up too
 i wonder men dare trust themselves with men
 methinks they should invite them without knives
 good for their meat and safer for their lives
 there's much example for't the fellow that sits
 next him now parts bread with him pledges the
 breath of him in a divided draught is the readiest
 man to kill him t has been proved if i were a
 huge man i should fear to drink at meals
 lest they should spy my windpipe's dangerous notes
 great men should drink with harness on their throats
timon my lord in heart and let the health go round
second lord let it flow this way my good lord
apemantus flow this way a brave fellow he keeps his tides
 well those healths will make thee and thy state
 look ill timon here's that which is too weak to
 be a sinner honest water which ne'er left man i the mire
 this and my food are equals there's no odds
 feasts are too proud to give thanks to the gods
 apemantus grace
 immortal gods i crave no pelf
 i pray for no man but myself
 grant i may never prove so fond
 to trust man on his oath or bond
 or a harlot for her weeping
 or a dog that seems asleeping
 or a keeper with my freedom
 or my friends if i should need em
 amen so fall to't
 rich men sin and i eat root
 eats and drinks
 much good dich thy good heart apemantus
timon captain alcibiades your heart's in the field now
alcibiades my heart is ever at your service my lord
timon you had rather be at a breakfast of enemies than a
 dinner of friends
alcibiades so the were bleedingnew my lord there's no meat
 like em i could wish my best friend at such a feast
apemantus would all those fatterers were thine enemies then
 that then thou mightst kill em and bid me to em
first lord might we but have that happiness my lord that you
 would once use our hearts whereby we might express
 some part of our zeals we should think ourselves
 for ever perfect
timon o no doubt my good friends but the gods
 themselves have provided that i shall have much help
 from you how had you been my friends else why
 have you that charitable title from thousands did
 not you chiefly belong to my heart i have told
 more of you to myself than you can with modesty
 speak in your own behalf and thus far i confirm
 you o you gods think i what need we have any
 friends if we should ne'er have need of em they
 were the most needless creatures living should we
 ne'er have use for em and would most resemble
 sweet instruments hung up in cases that keep their
 sounds to themselves why i have often wished
 myself poorer that i might come nearer to you we
 are born to do benefits and what better or
 properer can we can our own than the riches of our
 friends o what a precious comfort tis to have
 so many like brothers commanding one another's
 fortunes o joy e'en made away ere t can be born
 mine eyes cannot hold out water methinks to
 forget their faults i drink to you
apemantus thou weepest to make them drink timon
second lord joy had the like conception in our eyes
 and at that instant like a babe sprung up
apemantus ho ho i laugh to think that babe a bastard
third lord i promise you my lord you moved me much
apemantus much
 tucket within
timon what means that trump
 enter a servant
 how now
servant please you my lord there are certain
 ladies most desirous of admittance
timon ladies what are their wills
servant there comes with them a forerunner my lord which
 bears that office to signify their pleasures
timon i pray let them be admitted
 enter cupid
cupid hail to thee worthy timon and to all
 that of his bounties taste the five best senses
 acknowledge thee their patron and come freely
 to gratulate thy plenteous bosom th ear
 taste touch and smell pleased from thy tale rise
 they only now come but to feast thine eyes
timon they're welcome all let em have kind admittance
 music make their welcome
 exit cupid
first lord you see my lord how ample you're beloved
 music reenter cupid with a mask of ladies
 as amazons with lutes in their hands
 dancing and playing
apemantus hoyday what a sweep of vanity comes this way
 they dance they are mad women
 like madness is the glory of this life
 as this pomp shows to a little oil and root
 we make ourselves fools to disport ourselves
 and spend our flatteries to drink those men
 upon whose age we void it up again
 with poisonous spite and envy
 who lives that's not depraved or depraves
 who dies that bears not one spurn to their graves
 of their friends gift
 i should fear those that dance before me now
 would one day stamp upon me t has been done
 men shut their doors against a setting sun
 the lords rise from table with much adoring of
 timon and to show their loves each singles out an
 amazon and all dance men with women a lofty
 strain or two to the hautboys and cease
timon you have done our pleasures much grace fair ladies
 set a fair fashion on our entertainment
 which was not half so beautiful and kind
 you have added worth unto t and lustre
 and entertain'd me with mine own device
 i am to thank you for t
first lady my lord you take us even at the best
apemantus faith for the worst is filthy and would not hold
 taking i doubt me
timon ladies there is an idle banquet attends you
 please you to dispose yourselves
all ladies most thankfully my lord
 exeunt cupid and ladies
timon flavius
flavius my lord
timon the little casket bring me hither
flavius yes my lord more jewels yet
 there is no crossing him in s humour
 aside
