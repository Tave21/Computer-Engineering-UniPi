 a thing not in his power to bring to pass
 but sway'd and fashion'd by the hand of heaven
 was this inserted to make interest good
 or is your gold and silver ewes and rams
shylock i cannot tell i make it breed as fast
 but note me signior
antonio mark you this bassanio
 the devil can cite scripture for his purpose
 an evil soul producing holy witness
 is like a villain with a smiling cheek
 a goodly apple rotten at the heart
 o what a goodly outside falsehood hath
shylock three thousand ducats tis a good round sum
 three months from twelve then let me see the rate
antonio well shylock shall we be beholding to you
shylock signior antonio many a time and oft
 in the rialto you have rated me
 about my moneys and my usances
 still have i borne it with a patient shrug
 for sufferance is the badge of all our tribe
 you call me misbeliever cutthroat dog
 and spit upon my jewish gaberdine
 and all for use of that which is mine own
 well then it now appears you need my help
 go to then you come to me and you say
 shylock we would have moneys you say so
 you that did void your rheum upon my beard
 and foot me as you spurn a stranger cur
 over your threshold moneys is your suit
 what should i say to you should i not say
 hath a dog money is it possible
 a cur can lend three thousand ducats or
 shall i bend low and in a bondman's key
 with bated breath and whispering humbleness say this
 fair sir you spit on me on wednesday last
 you spurn'd me such a day another time
 you call'd me dog and for these courtesies
 i'll lend you thus much moneys'
antonio i am as like to call thee so again
 to spit on thee again to spurn thee too
 if thou wilt lend this money lend it not
 as to thy friends for when did friendship take
 a breed for barren metal of his friend
 but lend it rather to thine enemy
 who if he break thou mayst with better face
 exact the penalty
shylock why look you how you storm
 i would be friends with you and have your love
 forget the shames that you have stain'd me with
 supply your present wants and take no doit
 of usance for my moneys and you'll not hear me
 this is kind i offer
bassanio this were kindness
shylock this kindness will i show
 go with me to a notary seal me there
 your single bond and in a merry sport
 if you repay me not on such a day
 in such a place such sum or sums as are
 express'd in the condition let the forfeit
 be nominated for an equal pound
 of your fair flesh to be cut off and taken
 in what part of your body pleaseth me
antonio content i faith i'll seal to such a bond
 and say there is much kindness in the jew
bassanio you shall not seal to such a bond for me
 i'll rather dwell in my necessity
antonio why fear not man i will not forfeit it
 within these two months that's a month before
 this bond expires i do expect return
 of thrice three times the value of this bond
shylock o father abram what these christians are
 whose own hard dealings teaches them suspect
 the thoughts of others pray you tell me this
 if he should break his day what should i gain
 by the exaction of the forfeiture
 a pound of man's flesh taken from a man
 is not so estimable profitable neither
 as flesh of muttons beefs or goats i say
 to buy his favour i extend this friendship
 if he will take it so if not adieu
 and for my love i pray you wrong me not
antonio yes shylock i will seal unto this bond
shylock then meet me forthwith at the notary's
 give him direction for this merry bond
 and i will go and purse the ducats straight
 see to my house left in the fearful guard
 of an unthrifty knave and presently
 i will be with you
antonio hie thee gentle jew
 exit shylock
 the hebrew will turn christian he grows kind
bassanio i like not fair terms and a villain's mind
antonio come on in this there can be no dismay

 flourish of cornets enter the prince of morocco
 and his train portia nerissa and others
 attending
morocco mislike me not for my complexion
 the shadow'd livery of the burnish'd sun
 to whom i am a neighbour and near bred
 bring me the fairest creature northward born
 where phoebus fire scarce thaws the icicles
 and let us make incision for your love
 to prove whose blood is reddest his or mine
 i tell thee lady this aspect of mine
 hath fear'd the valiant by my love i swear
 the bestregarded virgins of our clime
 have loved it too i would not change this hue
 except to steal your thoughts my gentle queen
portia in terms of choice i am not solely led
 by nice direction of a maiden's eyes
 besides the lottery of my destiny
 bars me the right of voluntary choosing
 but if my father had not scanted me
 and hedged me by his wit to yield myself
 his wife who wins me by that means i told you
 yourself renowned prince then stood as fair
 as any comer i have look'd on yet
 for my affection
morocco even for that i thank you
 therefore i pray you lead me to the caskets
 to try my fortune by this scimitar
 that slew the sophy and a persian prince
 that won three fields of sultan solyman
 i would outstare the sternest eyes that look
 outbrave the heart most daring on the earth
 pluck the young sucking cubs from the shebear
 yea mock the lion when he roars for prey
 to win thee lady but alas the while
 if hercules and lichas play at dice
 which is the better man the greater throw
 may turn by fortune from the weaker hand
 so is alcides beaten by his page
 and so may i blind fortune leading me
 miss that which one unworthier may attain
 and die with grieving
portia you must take your chance
 and either not attempt to choose at all
 or swear before you choose if you choose wrong
 never to speak to lady afterward
 in way of marriage therefore be advised
morocco nor will not come bring me unto my chance
portia first forward to the temple after dinner
 your hazard shall be made
morocco good fortune then
 to make me blest or cursed'st among men
