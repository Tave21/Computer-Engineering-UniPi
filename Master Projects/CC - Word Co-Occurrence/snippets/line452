 to find out this abuse whence tis derived

 but in his clothes and one that hath spoke most
 villanous speeches of the duke

 enforce them against him we shall find this friar a
 notable fellow

 she'll be ashamed
escalus i will go darkly to work with her
lucio that's the way for women are light at midnight

 the duke vincentio in his friar's habit

duke vincentio respect to your great place and let the devil
 be sometime honour'd for his burning throne
 where is the duke tis he should hear me speak
escalus the duke's in us and we will hear you speak
 look you speak justly
duke vincentio boldly at least but o poor souls
 come you to seek the lamb here of the fox
 good night to your redress is the duke gone
 then is your cause gone too the duke's unjust
 thus to retort your manifest appeal
 and put your trial in the villain's mouth
 which here you come to accuse
lucio this is the rascal this is he i spoke of
escalus why thou unreverend and unhallow'd friar
 is't not enough thou hast suborn'd these women
 to accuse this worthy man but in foul mouth
 and in the witness of his proper ear
 to call him villain and then to glance from him
 to the duke himself to tax him with injustice
 take him hence to the rack with him we'll touse you
 joint by joint but we will know his purpose
 what unjust'
duke vincentio be not so hot the duke
 dare no more stretch this finger of mine than he
 dare rack his own his subject am i not
 nor here provincial my business in this state
 made me a looker on here in vienna
 where i have seen corruption boil and bubble
 till it o'errun the stew laws for all faults
 but faults so countenanced that the strong statutes
 stand like the forfeits in a barber's shop
 as much in mock as mark
escalus slander to the state away with him to prison
angelo what can you vouch against him signior lucio
 is this the man that you did tell us of
lucio tis he my lord come hither goodman baldpate
 do you know me
duke vincentio i remember you sir by the sound of your voice i
 met you at the prison in the absence of the duke
lucio o did you so and do you remember what you said of the duke
duke vincentio most notedly sir
lucio do you so sir and was the duke a fleshmonger a
 fool and a coward as you then reported him to be
duke vincentio you must sir change persons with me ere you make
 that my report you indeed spoke so of him and
 much more much worse
lucio o thou damnable fellow did not i pluck thee by the
 nose for thy speeches
duke vincentio i protest i love the duke as i love myself
angelo hark how the villain would close now after his
 treasonable abuses
escalus such a fellow is not to be talked withal away with
 him to prison where is the provost away with him
 to prison lay bolts enough upon him let him
 speak no more away with those giglots too and
 with the other confederate companion
duke vincentio to provost stay sir stay awhile
angelo what resists he help him lucio
lucio come sir come sir come sir foh sir why you
 baldpated lying rascal you must be hooded must
 you show your knave's visage with a pox to you
 show your sheepbiting face and be hanged an hour
 will't not off
 pulls off the friar's hood and discovers duke
 vincentio
duke vincentio thou art the first knave that e'er madest a duke
 first provost let me bail these gentle three
 to lucio
 sneak not away sir for the friar and you
 must have a word anon lay hold on him
lucio this may prove worse than hanging
duke vincentio to escalus what you have spoke i pardon sit you down
 we'll borrow place of him
 to angelo
 sir by your leave
 hast thou or word or wit or impudence
 that yet can do thee office if thou hast
 rely upon it till my tale be heard
 and hold no longer out
angelo o my dread lord
 i should be guiltier than my guiltiness
 to think i can be undiscernible
 when i perceive your grace like power divine
 hath look'd upon my passes then good prince
 no longer session hold upon my shame
 but let my trial be mine own confession
 immediate sentence then and sequent death
 is all the grace i beg
duke vincentio come hither mariana
 say wast thou e'er contracted to this woman
angelo i was my lord
duke vincentio go take her hence and marry her instantly
 do you the office friar which consummate
 return him here again go with him provost
 exeunt angelo mariana friar peter and provost
escalus my lord i am more amazed at his dishonour
 than at the strangeness of it
duke vincentio come hither isabel
 your friar is now your prince as i was then
 advertising and holy to your business
 not changing heart with habit i am still
 attorney'd at your service
isabella o give me pardon
 that i your vassal have employ'd and pain'd
 your unknown sovereignty
duke vincentio you are pardon'd isabel
 and now dear maid be you as free to us
 your brother's death i know sits at your heart
 and you may marvel why i obscured myself
 labouring to save his life and would not rather
 make rash remonstrance of my hidden power
 than let him so be lost o most kind maid
 it was the swift celerity of his death
 which i did think with slower foot came on
 that brain'd my purpose but peace be with him
 that life is better life past fearing death
 than that which lives to fear make it your comfort
 so happy is your brother
isabella i do my lord
 reenter angelo mariana friar peter and provost
duke vincentio for this newmarried man approaching here
 whose salt imagination yet hath wrong'd
 your well defended honour you must pardon
 for mariana's sake but as he adjudged your brother
 being criminal in double violation
 of sacred chastity and of promisebreach
 thereon dependent for your brother's life
 the very mercy of the law cries out
 most audible even from his proper tongue
 an angelo for claudio death for death'
 haste still pays haste and leisure answers leisure
 like doth quit like and measure still for measure
 then angelo thy fault's thus manifested
 which though thou wouldst deny denies thee vantage
 we do condemn thee to the very block
 where claudio stoop'd to death and with like haste
 away with him
mariana o my most gracious lord
 i hope you will not mock me with a husband
duke vincentio it is your husband mock'd you with a husband
 consenting to the safeguard of your honour
 i thought your marriage fit else imputation
