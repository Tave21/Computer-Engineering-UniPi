 nor tears nor prayers shall purchase out abuses
 therefore use none let romeo hence in haste
 else when he's found that hour is his last
 bear hence this body and attend our will
 mercy but murders pardoning those that kill
 exeunt
 romeo and juliet
act iii
scene ii capulet's orchard
 enter juliet
juliet gallop apace you fieryfooted steeds
 towards phoebus lodging such a wagoner
 as phaethon would whip you to the west
 and bring in cloudy night immediately
 spread thy close curtain loveperforming night
 that runaway's eyes may wink and romeo
 leap to these arms untalk'd of and unseen
 lovers can see to do their amorous rites
 by their own beauties or if love be blind
 it best agrees with night come civil night
 thou sobersuited matron all in black
 and learn me how to lose a winning match
 play'd for a pair of stainless maidenhoods
 hood my unmann'd blood bating in my cheeks
 with thy black mantle till strange love grown bold
 think true love acted simple modesty
 come night come romeo come thou day in night
 for thou wilt lie upon the wings of night
 whiter than new snow on a raven's back
 come gentle night come loving blackbrow'd night
 give me my romeo and when he shall die
 take him and cut him out in little stars
 and he will make the face of heaven so fine
 that all the world will be in love with night
 and pay no worship to the garish sun
 o i have bought the mansion of a love
 but not possess'd it and though i am sold
 not yet enjoy'd so tedious is this day
 as is the night before some festival
 to an impatient child that hath new robes
 and may not wear them o here comes my nurse
 and she brings news and every tongue that speaks
 but romeo's name speaks heavenly eloquence
 enter nurse with cords
 now nurse what news what hast thou there the cords
 that romeo bid thee fetch
nurse ay ay the cords
 throws them down
juliet ay me what news why dost thou wring thy hands
nurse ah welladay he's dead he's dead he's dead
 we are undone lady we are undone
 alack the day he's gone he's kill'd he's dead
juliet can heaven be so envious
nurse romeo can
 though heaven cannot o romeo romeo
 who ever would have thought it romeo
juliet what devil art thou that dost torment me thus
 this torture should be roar'd in dismal hell
 hath romeo slain himself say thou but i'
 and that bare vowel i shall poison more
 than the deathdarting eye of cockatrice
 i am not i if there be such an i
 or those eyes shut that make thee answer i'
 if he be slain say i or if not no
 brief sounds determine of my weal or woe
nurse i saw the wound i saw it with mine eyes
 god save the markhere on his manly breast
 a piteous corse a bloody piteous corse
 pale pale as ashes all bedaub'd in blood
 all in goreblood i swounded at the sight
juliet o break my heart poor bankrupt break at once
 to prison eyes ne'er look on liberty
 vile earth to earth resign end motion here
 and thou and romeo press one heavy bier
nurse o tybalt tybalt the best friend i had
 o courteous tybalt honest gentleman
 that ever i should live to see thee dead
juliet what storm is this that blows so contrary
 is romeo slaughter'd and is tybalt dead
 my dearloved cousin and my dearer lord
 then dreadful trumpet sound the general doom
 for who is living if those two are gone
nurse tybalt is gone and romeo banished
 romeo that kill'd him he is banished
juliet o god did romeo's hand shed tybalt's blood
nurse it did it did alas the day it did
juliet o serpent heart hid with a flowering face
 did ever dragon keep so fair a cave
 beautiful tyrant fiend angelical
 dovefeather'd raven wolvishravening lamb
 despised substance of divinest show
 just opposite to what thou justly seem'st
 a damned saint an honourable villain
 o nature what hadst thou to do in hell
 when thou didst bower the spirit of a fiend
 in moral paradise of such sweet flesh
 was ever book containing such vile matter
 so fairly bound o that deceit should dwell
 in such a gorgeous palace
nurse there's no trust
 no faith no honesty in men all perjured
 all forsworn all naught all dissemblers
 ah where's my man give me some aqua vitae
 these griefs these woes these sorrows make me old
 shame come to romeo
juliet blister'd be thy tongue
 for such a wish he was not born to shame
 upon his brow shame is ashamed to sit
 for tis a throne where honour may be crown'd
 sole monarch of the universal earth
 o what a beast was i to chide at him
nurse will you speak well of him that kill'd your cousin
juliet shall i speak ill of him that is my husband
 ah poor my lord what tongue shall smooth thy name
 when i thy threehours wife have mangled it
 but wherefore villain didst thou kill my cousin
 that villain cousin would have kill'd my husband
 back foolish tears back to your native spring
 your tributary drops belong to woe
 which you mistaking offer up to joy
 my husband lives that tybalt would have slain
 and tybalt's dead that would have slain my husband
 all this is comfort wherefore weep i then
 some word there was worser than tybalt's death
 that murder'd me i would forget it fain
 but o it presses to my memory
 like damned guilty deeds to sinners minds
 tybalt is dead and romeobanished'
 that banished that one word banished'
 hath slain ten thousand tybalts tybalt's death
 was woe enough if it had ended there
 or if sour woe delights in fellowship
 and needly will be rank'd with other griefs
 why follow'd not when she said tybalt's dead'
 thy father or thy mother nay or both
 which modern lamentations might have moved
 but with a rearward following tybalt's death
 romeo is banished to speak that word
 is father mother tybalt romeo juliet
 all slain all dead romeo is banished'
 there is no end no limit measure bound
 in that word's death no words can that woe sound
 where is my father and my mother nurse
nurse weeping and wailing over tybalt's corse
 will you go to them i will bring you thither
juliet wash they his wounds with tears mine shall be spent
 when theirs are dry for romeo's banishment
 take up those cords poor ropes you are beguiled
 both you and i for romeo is exiled
 he made you for a highway to my bed
 but i a maid die maidenwidowed
 come cords come nurse i'll to my weddingbed
 and death not romeo take my maidenhead
nurse hie to your chamber i'll find romeo
 to comfort you i wot well where he is
 hark ye your romeo will be here at night
 i'll to him he is hid at laurence cell
juliet o find him give this ring to my true knight
 and bid him come to take his last farewell
 exeunt
 romeo and juliet
act iii
scene iii friar laurence's cell
 enter friar laurence
friar laurence romeo come forth come forth thou fearful man
 affliction is enamour'd of thy parts
 and thou art wedded to calamity
 enter romeo
romeo father what news what is the prince's doom
 what sorrow craves acquaintance at my hand
 that i yet know not
friar laurence too familiar
 is my dear son with such sour company
 i bring thee tidings of the prince's doom
romeo what less than doomsday is the prince's doom
friar laurence a gentler judgment vanish'd from his lips
 not body's death but body's banishment
romeo ha banishment be merciful say death'
 for exile hath more terror in his look
 much more than death do not say banishment'
friar laurence hence from verona art thou banished
 be patient for the world is broad and wide
romeo there is no world without verona walls
 but purgatory torture hell itself
 hencebanished is banish'd from the world
 and world's exile is death then banished
 is death misterm'd calling death banishment
 thou cutt'st my head off with a golden axe
 and smilest upon the stroke that murders me
friar laurence o deadly sin o rude unthankfulness
 thy fault our law calls death but the kind prince
 taking thy part hath rush'd aside the law
 and turn'd that black word death to banishment
 this is dear mercy and thou seest it not
romeo tis torture and not mercy heaven is here
 where juliet lives and every cat and dog
 and little mouse every unworthy thing
 live here in heaven and may look on her
 but romeo may not more validity
 more honourable state more courtship lives
