flavius pray you walk near i'll speak with you anon
 exeunt servants
timon you make me marvel wherefore ere this time
 had you not fully laid my state before me
 that i might so have rated my expense
 as i had leave of means
flavius you would not hear me
 at many leisures i proposed
timon go to
 perchance some single vantages you took
 when my indisposition put you back
 and that unaptness made your minister
 thus to excuse yourself
flavius o my good lord
 at many times i brought in my accounts
 laid them before you you would throw them off
 and say you found them in mine honesty
 when for some trifling present you have bid me
 return so much i have shook my head and wept
 yea gainst the authority of manners pray'd you
 to hold your hand more close i did endure
 not seldom nor no slight cheques when i have
 prompted you in the ebb of your estate
 and your great flow of debts my loved lord
 though you hear now too lateyet now's a time
 the greatest of your having lacks a half
 to pay your present debts
timon let all my land be sold
flavius tis all engaged some forfeited and gone
 and what remains will hardly stop the mouth
 of present dues the future comes apace
 what shall defend the interim and at length
 how goes our reckoning
timon to lacedaemon did my land extend
flavius o my good lord the world is but a word
 were it all yours to give it in a breath
 how quickly were it gone
timon you tell me true
flavius if you suspect my husbandry or falsehood
 call me before the exactest auditors
 and set me on the proof so the gods bless me
 when all our offices have been oppress'd
 with riotous feeders when our vaults have wept
 with drunken spilth of wine when every room
 hath blazed with lights and bray'd with minstrelsy
 i have retired me to a wasteful cock
 and set mine eyes at flow
timon prithee no more
flavius heavens have i said the bounty of this lord
 how many prodigal bits have slaves and peasants
 this night englutted who is not timon's
 what heart head sword force means but is
 lord timon's
 great timon noble worthy royal timon
 ah when the means are gone that buy this praise
 the breath is gone whereof this praise is made
 feastwon fastlost one cloud of winter showers
 these flies are couch'd
timon come sermon me no further
 no villanous bounty yet hath pass'd my heart
 unwisely not ignobly have i given
 why dost thou weep canst thou the conscience lack
 to think i shall lack friends secure thy heart
 if i would broach the vessels of my love
 and try the argument of hearts by borrowing
 men and men's fortunes could i frankly use
 as i can bid thee speak
flavius assurance bless your thoughts
timon and in some sort these wants of mine are crown'd
 that i account them blessings for by these
 shall i try friends you shall perceive how you
 mistake my fortunes i am wealthy in my friends
 within there flaminius servilius
 enter flaminius servilius and other servants
servants my lord my lord
timon i will dispatch you severally you to lord lucius
 to lord lucullus you i hunted with his honour
 today you to sempronius commend me to their
 loves and i am proud say that my occasions have
 found time to use em toward a supply of money let
 the request be fifty talents
flaminius as you have said my lord
flavius aside lord lucius and lucullus hum
timon go you sir to the senators
 of whom even to the state's best health i have
 deserved this hearingbid em send o the instant
 a thousand talents to me
flavius i have been bold
 for that i knew it the most general way
 to them to use your signet and your name
 but they do shake their heads and i am here
 no richer in return
timon is't true can't be
flavius they answer in a joint and corporate voice
 that now they are at fall want treasure cannot
 do what they would are sorryyou are honourable
 but yet they could have wish'dthey know not
 something hath been amissa noble nature
 may catch a wrenchwould all were well'tis pity
 and so intending other serious matters
 after distasteful looks and these hard fractions
