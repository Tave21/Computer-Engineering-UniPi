othello i greet thy love
 not with vain thanks but with acceptance bounteous
 and will upon the instant put thee to't
 within these three days let me hear thee say
 that cassio's not alive
iago my friend is dead tis done at your request
 but let her live
othello damn her lewd minx o damn her
 come go with me apart i will withdraw
 to furnish me with some swift means of death
 for the fair devil now art thou my lieutenant
iago i am your own for ever
 exeunt
 othello
act iii
scene iv before the castle
 enter desdemona emilia and clown
desdemona do you know sirrah where lieutenant cassio lies
clown i dare not say he lies any where
desdemona why man
clown he's a soldier and for one to say a soldier lies
 is stabbing
desdemona go to where lodges he
clown to tell you where he lodges is to tell you where i lie
desdemona can any thing be made of this
clown i know not where he lodges and for me to devise a
 lodging and say he lies here or he lies there were
 to lie in mine own throat
desdemona can you inquire him out and be edified by report
clown i will catechise the world for him that is make
 questions and by them answer
desdemona seek him bid him come hither tell him i have
 moved my lord on his behalf and hope all will be well
clown to do this is within the compass of man's wit and
 therefore i will attempt the doing it
 exit
desdemona where should i lose that handkerchief emilia
emilia i know not madam
desdemona believe me i had rather have lost my purse
 full of crusadoes and but my noble moor
 is true of mind and made of no such baseness
 as jealous creatures are it were enough
 to put him to ill thinking
emilia is he not jealous
desdemona who he i think the sun where he was born
 drew all such humours from him
emilia look where he comes
desdemona i will not leave him now till cassio
 be call'd to him
 enter othello
 how is't with you my lord
othello well my good lady
 aside
 o hardness to dissemble
 how do you desdemona
desdemona well my good lord
othello give me your hand this hand is moist my lady
desdemona it yet hath felt no age nor known no sorrow
othello this argues fruitfulness and liberal heart
 hot hot and moist this hand of yours requires
 a sequester from liberty fasting and prayer
 much castigation exercise devout
 for here's a young and sweating devil here
 that commonly rebels tis a good hand
 a frank one
desdemona you may indeed say so
 for twas that hand that gave away my heart
othello a liberal hand the hearts of old gave hands
 but our new heraldry is hands not hearts
desdemona i cannot speak of this come now your promise
othello what promise chuck
desdemona i have sent to bid cassio come speak with you
othello i have a salt and sorry rheum offends me
 lend me thy handkerchief
desdemona here my lord
othello that which i gave you
desdemona i have it not about me
othello not
desdemona no indeed my lord
othello that is a fault
 that handkerchief
 did an egyptian to my mother give
 she was a charmer and could almost read
 the thoughts of people she told her while
 she kept it
 twould make her amiable and subdue my father
 entirely to her love but if she lost it
 or made gift of it my father's eye
 should hold her loathed and his spirits should hunt
 after new fancies she dying gave it me
 and bid me when my fate would have me wive
 to give it her i did so and take heed on't
 make it a darling like your precious eye
 to lose't or give't away were such perdition
 as nothing else could match
desdemona is't possible
othello tis true there's magic in the web of it
 a sibyl that had number'd in the world
 the sun to course two hundred compasses
 in her prophetic fury sew'd the work
 the worms were hallow'd that did breed the silk
 and it was dyed in mummy which the skilful
 conserved of maidens hearts
desdemona indeed is't true
othello most veritable therefore look to't well
desdemona then would to god that i had never seen't
othello ha wherefore
desdemona why do you speak so startingly and rash
othello is't lost is't gone speak is it out
 o the way
desdemona heaven bless us
othello say you
desdemona it is not lost but what an if it were
othello how
desdemona i say it is not lost
othello fetch't let me see't
desdemona why so i can sir but i will not now
 this is a trick to put me from my suit
 pray you let cassio be received again
othello fetch me the handkerchief my mind misgives
desdemona come come
 you'll never meet a more sufficient man
othello the handkerchief
desdemona i pray talk me of cassio
othello the handkerchief
desdemona a man that all his time
 hath founded his good fortunes on your love
 shared dangers with you
othello the handkerchief
desdemona in sooth you are to blame
othello away
 exit
emilia is not this man jealous
desdemona i ne'er saw this before
 sure there's some wonder in this handkerchief
 i am most unhappy in the loss of it
emilia tis not a year or two shows us a man
 they are all but stomachs and we all but food
 to eat us hungerly and when they are full
 they belch us look you cassio and my husband
 enter cassio and iago
iago there is no other way tis she must do't
 and lo the happiness go and importune her
desdemona how now good cassio what's the news with you
cassio madam my former suit i do beseech you
 that by your virtuous means i may again
 exist and be a member of his love
 whom i with all the office of my heart
 entirely honour i would not be delay'd
 if my offence be of such mortal kind
 that nor my service past nor present sorrows
 nor purposed merit in futurity
 can ransom me into his love again
 but to know so must be my benefit
 so shall i clothe me in a forced content
 and shut myself up in some other course
 to fortune's alms
desdemona alas thricegentle cassio
 my advocation is not now in tune
 my lord is not my lord nor should i know him
 were he in favour as in humour alter'd
 so help me every spirit sanctified
 as i have spoken for you all my best
 and stood within the blank of his displeasure
 for my free speech you must awhile be patient
 what i can do i will and more i will
 than for myself i dare let that suffice you
iago is my lord angry
emilia he went hence but now
 and certainly in strange unquietness
iago can he be angry i have seen the cannon
 when it hath blown his ranks into the air
 and like the devil from his very arm
 puff'd his own brotherand can he be angry
 something of moment then i will go meet him
 there's matter in't indeed if he be angry
desdemona i prithee do so
 exit iago
 something sure of state
 either from venice or some unhatch'd practise
 made demonstrable here in cyprus to him
 hath puddled his clear spirit and in such cases
 men's natures wrangle with inferior things
 though great ones are their object tis even so
 for let our finger ache and it indues
 our other healthful members even to that sense
 of pain nay we must think men are not gods
 nor of them look for such observances
 as fit the bridal beshrew me much emilia
 i was unhandsome warrior as i am
 arraigning his unkindness with my soul
 but now i find i had suborn'd the witness
 and he's indicted falsely
emilia pray heaven it be statematters as you think
 and no conception nor no jealous toy
 concerning you
desdemona alas the day i never gave him cause
emilia but jealous souls will not be answer'd so
 they are not ever jealous for the cause
 but jealous for they are jealous tis a monster
