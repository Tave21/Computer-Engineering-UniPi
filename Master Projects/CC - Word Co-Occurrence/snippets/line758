 so now i have mine own again be gone
 that i might strive to kill it with a groan
king richard ii we make woe wanton with this fond delay
 once more adieu the rest let sorrow say
 exeunt
 king richard ii
act v
scene ii the duke of york's palace
 enter duke of york and duchess of york
duchess of york my lord you told me you would tell the rest
 when weeping made you break the story off
 of our two cousins coming into london
duke of york where did i leave
duchess of york at that sad stop my lord
 where rude misgovern'd hands from windows tops
 threw dust and rubbish on king richard's head
duke of york then as i said the duke great bolingbroke
 mounted upon a hot and fiery steed
 which his aspiring rider seem'd to know
 with slow but stately pace kept on his course
 whilst all tongues cried god save thee
 bolingbroke'
 you would have thought the very windows spake
 so many greedy looks of young and old
 through casements darted their desiring eyes
 upon his visage and that all the walls
 with painted imagery had said at once
 jesu preserve thee welcome bolingbroke'
 whilst he from the one side to the other turning
 bareheaded lower than his proud steed's neck
 bespake them thus i thank you countrymen'
 and thus still doing thus he pass'd along
duchess of york alack poor richard where rode he the whilst
duke of york as in a theatre the eyes of men
 after a wellgraced actor leaves the stage
 are idly bent on him that enters next
 thinking his prattle to be tedious
 even so or with much more contempt men's eyes
 did scowl on gentle richard no man cried god save him'
 no joyful tongue gave him his welcome home
 but dust was thrown upon his sacred head
 which with such gentle sorrow he shook off
 his face still combating with tears and smiles
 the badges of his grief and patience
 that had not god for some strong purpose steel'd
 the hearts of men they must perforce have melted
 and barbarism itself have pitied him
 but heaven hath a hand in these events
 to whose high will we bound our calm contents
 to bolingbroke are we sworn subjects now
 whose state and honour i for aye allow
duchess of york here comes my son aumerle
duke of york aumerle that was
 but that is lost for being richard's friend
 and madam you must call him rutland now
 i am in parliament pledge for his truth
 and lasting fealty to the newmade king
 enter duke of aumerle
duchess of york welcome my son who are the violets now
 that strew the green lap of the new come spring
duke of aumerle madam i know not nor i greatly care not
 god knows i had as lief be none as one
duke of york well bear you well in this new spring of time
 lest you be cropp'd before you come to prime
 what news from oxford hold those justs and triumphs
duke of aumerle for aught i know my lord they do
duke of york you will be there i know
duke of aumerle if god prevent not i purpose so
duke of york what seal is that that hangs without thy bosom
 yea look'st thou pale let me see the writing
duke of aumerle my lord tis nothing
duke of york no matter then who see it
 i will be satisfied let me see the writing
duke of aumerle i do beseech your grace to pardon me
 it is a matter of small consequence
 which for some reasons i would not have seen
duke of york which for some reasons sir i mean to see
 i fear i fear
duchess of york what should you fear
 tis nothing but some bond that he is enter'd into
 for gay apparel gainst the triumph day
duke of york bound to himself what doth he with a bond
 that he is bound to wife thou art a fool
 boy let me see the writing
duke of aumerle i do beseech you pardon me i may not show it
duke of york i will be satisfied let me see it i say
 he plucks it out of his bosom and reads it
 treason foul treason villain traitor slave
duchess of york what is the matter my lord
duke of york ho who is within there
 enter a servant

 god for his mercy what treachery is here
duchess of york why what is it my lord
duke of york give me my boots i say saddle my horse

 i will appeach the villain
duchess of york what is the matter
duke of york peace foolish woman
duchess of york i will not peace what is the matter aumerle
duke of aumerle good mother be content it is no more
 than my poor life must answer
duchess of york thy life answer
duke of york bring me my boots i will unto the king
 reenter servant with boots
duchess of york strike him aumerle poor boy thou art amazed
 hence villain never more come in my sight
duke of york give me my boots i say
duchess of york why york what wilt thou do
 wilt thou not hide the trespass of thine own
 have we more sons or are we like to have
 is not my teeming date drunk up with time
 and wilt thou pluck my fair son from mine age
 and rob me of a happy mother's name
 is he not like thee is he not thine own
duke of york thou fond mad woman
 wilt thou conceal this dark conspiracy
 a dozen of them here have ta'en the sacrament
 and interchangeably set down their hands
 to kill the king at oxford
duchess of york he shall be none
 we'll keep him here then what is that to him
duke of york away fond woman were he twenty times my son
 i would appeach him
duchess of york hadst thou groan'd for him
 as i have done thou wouldst be more pitiful
 but now i know thy mind thou dost suspect
 that i have been disloyal to thy bed
 and that he is a bastard not thy son
 sweet york sweet husband be not of that mind
 he is as like thee as a man may be
 not like to me or any of my kin
 and yet i love him
duke of york make way unruly woman
 exit
duchess of york after aumerle mount thee upon his horse
 spur post and get before him to the king
 and beg thy pardon ere he do accuse thee
 i'll not be long behind though i be old
 i doubt not but to ride as fast as york
 and never will i rise up from the ground
 till bolingbroke have pardon'd thee away be gone
 exeunt

act v
scene iii a royal palace
 enter henry bolingbroke henry percy and other lords
henry bolingbroke can no man tell me of my unthrifty son
 tis full three months since i did see him last
 if any plague hang over us tis he
 i would to god my lords he might be found
 inquire at london mongst the taverns there
 for there they say he daily doth frequent
 with unrestrained loose companions
 even such they say as stand in narrow lanes
 and beat our watch and rob our passengers
 which he young wanton and effeminate boy
 takes on the point of honour to support
 so dissolute a crew
henry percy my lord some two days since i saw the prince
 and told him of those triumphs held at oxford
henry bolingbroke and what said the gallant
henry percy his answer was he would unto the stews
 and from the common'st creature pluck a glove
 and wear it as a favour and with that
 he would unhorse the lustiest challenger
henry bolingbroke as dissolute as desperate yet through both
 i see some sparks of better hope which elder years
 may happily bring forth but who comes here
 enter duke of aumerle
duke of aumerle where is the king
henry bolingbroke what means our cousin that he stares and looks
 so wildly
duke of aumerle god save your grace i do beseech your majesty
 to have some conference with your grace alone
henry bolingbroke withdraw yourselves and leave us here alone
 exeunt henry percy and lords
 what is the matter with our cousin now
duke of aumerle for ever may my knees grow to the earth
 my tongue cleave to my roof within my mouth
 unless a pardon ere i rise or speak
henry bolingbroke intended or committed was this fault
 if on the first how heinous e'er it be
 to win thy afterlove i pardon thee
duke of aumerle then give me leave that i may turn the key
 that no man enter till my tale be done
henry bolingbroke have thy desire
duke of york within my liege beware look to thyself
 thou hast a traitor in thy presence there
henry bolingbroke villain i'll make thee safe
 drawing
duke of aumerle stay thy revengeful hand thou hast no cause to fear
duke of york within open the door secure foolhardy king
 shall i for love speak treason to thy face
 open the door or i will break it open
 enter duke of york
henry bolingbroke what is the matter uncle speak
 recover breath tell us how near is danger
 that we may arm us to encounter it
duke of york peruse this writing here and thou shalt know
