 dialogue between the fool and the soldier come

 poor gallant knave
bertram no matter his heels have deserved it in usurping
 his spurs so long how does he carry himself
second lord i have told your lordship already the stocks carry
 him but to answer you as you would be understood
 he weeps like a wench that had shed her milk he
 hath confessed himself to morgan whom he supposes
 to be a friar from the time of his remembrance to
 this very instant disaster of his setting i the
 stocks and what think you he hath confessed
bertram nothing of me has a'
second lord his confession is taken and it shall be read to his
 face if your lordship be in't as i believe you
 are you must have the patience to hear it

 unserviceable the troops are all scattered and
 the commanders very poor rogues upon my reputation
 and credit and as i hope to live

parolles do i'll take the sacrament on't how and which way you will
bertram all's one to him what a pastsaving slave is this
first lord you're deceived my lord this is monsieur
 parolles the gallant militaristthat was his own
 phrasethat had the whole theoric of war in the
 knot of his scarf and the practise in the chape of
 his dagger
second lord i will never trust a man again for keeping his sword
 clean nor believe he can have every thing in him
 by wearing his apparel neatly
first soldier well that's set down
parolles five or six thousand horse i said i will say
 trueor thereabouts set down for i'll speak truth
first lord he's very near the truth in this
bertram but i con him no thanks for't in the nature he
 delivers it
parolles poor rogues i pray you say
first soldier well that's set down
parolles i humbly thank you sir a truth's a truth the
 rogues are marvellous poor
first soldier reads demand of him of what strength they are
 afoot what say you to that
parolles by my troth sir if i were to live this present
 hour i will tell true let me see spurio a
 hundred and fifty sebastian so many corambus so
 many jaques so many guiltian cosmo lodowick
 and gratii two hundred and fifty each mine own
 company chitopher vaumond bentii two hundred and
 fifty each so that the musterfile rotten and
 sound upon my life amounts not to fifteen thousand
 poll half of the which dare not shake snow from off
 their cassocks lest they shake themselves to pieces
bertram what shall be done to him
first lord nothing but let him have thanks demand of him my
 condition and what credit i have with the duke
first soldier well that's set down
 reads
 you shall demand of him whether one captain dumain
 be i the camp a frenchman what his reputation is
 with the duke what his valour honesty and
 expertness in wars or whether he thinks it were not
 possible with wellweighing sums of gold to
 corrupt him to revolt what say you to this what
 do you know of it
parolles i beseech you let me answer to the particular of
 the inter'gatories demand them singly
first soldier do you know this captain dumain
parolles i know him a was a botcher's prentice in paris
 from whence he was whipped for getting the shrieve's
 fool with childa dumb innocent that could not
 say him nay
bertram nay by your leave hold your hands though i know
 his brains are forfeit to the next tile that falls
first soldier well is this captain in the duke of florence's camp
parolles upon my knowledge he is and lousy
first lord nay look not so upon me we shall hear of your
 lordship anon
first soldier what is his reputation with the duke
parolles the duke knows him for no other but a poor officer
 of mine and writ to me this other day to turn him
 out o the band i think i have his letter in my pocket
first soldier marry we'll search
parolles in good sadness i do not know either it is there
 or it is upon a file with the duke's other letters
 in my tent
first soldier here tis here's a paper shall i read it to you
parolles i do not know if it be it or no
bertram our interpreter does it well
first lord excellently
first soldier reads dian the count's a fool and full of gold'
parolles that is not the duke's letter sir that is an
 advertisement to a proper maid in florence one
 diana to take heed of the allurement of one count
 rousillon a foolish idle boy but for all that very
 ruttish i pray you sir put it up again
first soldier nay i'll read it first by your favour
parolles my meaning in't i protest was very honest in the
 behalf of the maid for i knew the young count to be
 a dangerous and lascivious boy who is a whale to
 virginity and devours up all the fry it finds
bertram damnable bothsides rogue
first soldier reads when he swears oaths bid him drop gold and take it
 after he scores he never pays the score
 half won is match well made match and well make it
 he ne'er pays afterdebts take it before
 and say a soldier dian told thee this
 men are to mell with boys are not to kiss
 for count of this the count's a fool i know it
 who pays before but not when he does owe it
 thine as he vowed to thee in thine ear
 parolles'
bertram he shall be whipped through the army with this rhyme
 in's forehead
second lord this is your devoted friend sir the manifold
 linguist and the armipotent soldier
bertram i could endure any thing before but a cat and now
 he's a cat to me
first soldier i perceive sir by the general's looks we shall be
 fain to hang you
parolles my life sir in any case not that i am afraid to
 die but that my offences being many i would
 repent out the remainder of nature let me live
 sir in a dungeon i the stocks or any where so i may live
first soldier we'll see what may be done so you confess freely
 therefore once more to this captain dumain you
 have answered to his reputation with the duke and to
 his valour what is his honesty
parolles he will steal sir an egg out of a cloister for
 rapes and ravishments he parallels nessus he
 professes not keeping of oaths in breaking em he
 is stronger than hercules he will lie sir with
 such volubility that you would think truth were a
 fool drunkenness is his best virtue for he will
 be swinedrunk and in his sleep he does little
 harm save to his bedclothes about him but they
 know his conditions and lay him in straw i have but
 little more to say sir of his honesty he has
 every thing that an honest man should not have what
 an honest man should have he has nothing
first lord i begin to love him for this
bertram for this description of thine honesty a pox upon
 him for me he's more and more a cat
first soldier what say you to his expertness in war
parolles faith sir he has led the drum before the english
 tragedians to belie him i will not and more of
 his soldiership i know not except in that country
 he had the honour to be the officer at a place there
 called mileend to instruct for the doubling of
 files i would do the man what honour i can but of
 this i am not certain
first lord he hath outvillained villany so far that the
 rarity redeems him
bertram a pox on him he's a cat still
first soldier his qualities being at this poor price i need not
 to ask you if gold will corrupt him to revolt
parolles sir for a quart d'ecu he will sell the feesimple
 of his salvation the inheritance of it and cut the
 entail from all remainders and a perpetual
 succession for it perpetually
first soldier what's his brother the other captain dumain
second lord why does be ask him of me
first soldier what's he
parolles e'en a crow o the same nest not altogether so
 great as the first in goodness but greater a great
 deal in evil he excels his brother for a coward
 yet his brother is reputed one of the best that is
 in a retreat he outruns any lackey marry in coming
 on he has the cramp
first soldier if your life be saved will you undertake to betray
 the florentine
