they shall be even an abomination unto you ye shall not eat of their flesh but ye shall have their carcases in abomination
whatsoever hath no fins nor scales in the waters that shall be an abomination unto you
and these are they which ye shall have in abomination among the fowls they shall not be eaten they are an abomination the eagle and the ossifrage and the ospray

but all other flying creeping things which have four feet shall be an abomination unto you
and for these ye shall be unclean whosoever toucheth the carcase of them shall be unclean until the even
and whosoever beareth ought of the carcase of them shall wash his clothes and be unclean until the even
the carcases of every beast which divideth the hoof and is not clovenfooted nor cheweth the cud are unclean unto you every one that toucheth them shall be unclean
and whatsoever goeth upon his paws among all manner of beasts that go on all four those are unclean unto you whoso toucheth their carcase shall be unclean until the even
