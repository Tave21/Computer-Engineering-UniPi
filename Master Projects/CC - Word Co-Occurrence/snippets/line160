 so far ask pardon as befits mine honour
 to stoop in such a case
lepidus tis noble spoken
mecaenas if it might please you to enforce no further
 the griefs between ye to forget them quite
 were to remember that the present need
 speaks to atone you
lepidus worthily spoken mecaenas
domitius enobarbus or if you borrow one another's love for the
 instant you may when you hear no more words of
 pompey return it again you shall have time to
 wrangle in when you have nothing else to do
mark antony thou art a soldier only speak no more
domitius enobarbus that truth should be silent i had almost forgot
mark antony you wrong this presence therefore speak no more
domitius enobarbus go to then your considerate stone
octavius caesar i do not much dislike the matter but
 the manner of his speech for't cannot be
 we shall remain in friendship our conditions
 so differing in their acts yet if i knew
 what hoop should hold us stanch from edge to edge
 o the world i would pursue it
agrippa give me leave caesar
octavius caesar speak agrippa
agrippa thou hast a sister by the mother's side
 admired octavia great mark antony
 is now a widower
octavius caesar say not so agrippa
 if cleopatra heard you your reproof
 were well deserved of rashness
mark antony i am not married caesar let me hear
 agrippa further speak
agrippa to hold you in perpetual amity
 to make you brothers and to knit your hearts
 with an unslipping knot take antony
 octavia to his wife whose beauty claims
 no worse a husband than the best of men
 whose virtue and whose general graces speak
 that which none else can utter by this marriage
 all little jealousies which now seem great
 and all great fears which now import their dangers
 would then be nothing truths would be tales
 where now half tales be truths her love to both
 would each to other and all loves to both
 draw after her pardon what i have spoke
 for tis a studied not a present thought
 by duty ruminated
mark antony will caesar speak
octavius caesar not till he hears how antony is touch'd
 with what is spoke already
mark antony what power is in agrippa
 if i would say agrippa be it so'
 to make this good
octavius caesar the power of caesar and
 his power unto octavia
mark antony may i never
 to this good purpose that so fairly shows
 dream of impediment let me have thy hand
 further this act of grace and from this hour
 the heart of brothers govern in our loves
 and sway our great designs
octavius caesar there is my hand
 a sister i bequeath you whom no brother
 did ever love so dearly let her live
 to join our kingdoms and our hearts and never
 fly off our loves again
lepidus happily amen
mark antony i did not think to draw my sword gainst pompey
 for he hath laid strange courtesies and great
 of late upon me i must thank him only
 lest my remembrance suffer ill report
 at heel of that defy him
lepidus time calls upon's
 of us must pompey presently be sought
 or else he seeks out us
mark antony where lies he
octavius caesar about the mount misenum
mark antony what is his strength by land
octavius caesar great and increasing but by sea
 he is an absolute master
mark antony so is the fame
 would we had spoke together haste we for it
 yet ere we put ourselves in arms dispatch we
 the business we have talk'd of
octavius caesar with most gladness
 and do invite you to my sister's view
 whither straight i'll lead you
mark antony let us lepidus
 not lack your company
lepidus noble antony
 not sickness should detain me
 flourish exeunt octavius caesar mark antony
 and lepidus
mecaenas welcome from egypt sir
domitius enobarbus half the heart of caesar worthy mecaenas my
 honourable friend agrippa
agrippa good enobarbus
mecaenas we have cause to be glad that matters are so well
 digested you stayed well by t in egypt
domitius enobarbus ay sir we did sleep day out of countenance and
 made the night light with drinking
mecaenas eight wildboars roasted whole at a breakfast and
 but twelve persons there is this true
domitius enobarbus this was but as a fly by an eagle we had much more
 monstrous matter of feast which worthily deserved noting
mecaenas she's a most triumphant lady if report be square to
 her
domitius enobarbus when she first met mark antony she pursed up
 his heart upon the river of cydnus
agrippa there she appeared indeed or my reporter devised
 well for her
domitius enobarbus i will tell you
 the barge she sat in like a burnish'd throne
 burn'd on the water the poop was beaten gold
 purple the sails and so perfumed that
 the winds were lovesick with them the oars were silver
 which to the tune of flutes kept stroke and made
 the water which they beat to follow faster
 as amorous of their strokes for her own person
 it beggar'd all description she did lie
 in her pavilionclothofgold of tissue
 o'erpicturing that venus where we see
 the fancy outwork nature on each side her
 stood pretty dimpled boys like smiling cupids
 with diverscolour'd fans whose wind did seem
 to glow the delicate cheeks which they did cool
 and what they undid did
agrippa o rare for antony
domitius enobarbus her gentlewomen like the nereides
 so many mermaids tended her i the eyes
 and made their bends adornings at the helm
 a seeming mermaid steers the silken tackle
 swell with the touches of those flowersoft hands
 that yarely frame the office from the barge
 a strange invisible perfume hits the sense
 of the adjacent wharfs the city cast
 her people out upon her and antony
 enthroned i the marketplace did sit alone
 whistling to the air which but for vacancy
 had gone to gaze on cleopatra too
 and made a gap in nature
agrippa rare egyptian
domitius enobarbus upon her landing antony sent to her
 invited her to supper she replied
 it should be better he became her guest
 which she entreated our courteous antony
 whom ne'er the word of no woman heard speak
 being barber'd ten times o'er goes to the feast
 and for his ordinary pays his heart
 for what his eyes eat only
agrippa royal wench
 she made great caesar lay his sword to bed
 he plough'd her and she cropp'd
domitius enobarbus i saw her once
 hop forty paces through the public street
 and having lost her breath she spoke and panted
 that she did make defect perfection
 and breathless power breathe forth
mecaenas now antony must leave her utterly
domitius enobarbus never he will not
 age cannot wither her nor custom stale
 her infinite variety other women cloy
 the appetites they feed but she makes hungry
 where most she satisfies for vilest things
 become themselves in her that the holy priests
 bless her when she is riggish
mecaenas if beauty wisdom modesty can settle
 the heart of antony octavia is
 a blessed lottery to him
agrippa let us go
 good enobarbus make yourself my guest
 whilst you abide here
domitius enobarbus humbly sir i thank you
 exeunt
 antony and cleopatra
