 performer i would have that drum or another or
 hic jacet'
bertram why if you have a stomach to't monsieur if you
 think your mystery in stratagem can bring this
 instrument of honour again into his native quarter
 be magnanimous in the enterprise and go on i will
 grace the attempt for a worthy exploit if you
 speed well in it the duke shall both speak of it
 and extend to you what further becomes his
 greatness even to the utmost syllable of your
 worthiness
parolles by the hand of a soldier i will undertake it
bertram but you must not now slumber in it
parolles i'll about it this evening and i will presently
 pen down my dilemmas encourage myself in my
 certainty put myself into my mortal preparation
 and by midnight look to hear further from me
bertram may i be bold to acquaint his grace you are gone about it
parolles i know not what the success will be my lord but
 the attempt i vow
bertram i know thou'rt valiant and to the possibility of
 thy soldiership will subscribe for thee farewell
parolles i love not many words
 exit
second lord no more than a fish loves water is not this a
 strange fellow my lord that so confidently seems
 to undertake this business which he knows is not to
 be done damns himself to do and dares better be
 damned than to do't
first lord you do not know him my lord as we do certain it
 is that he will steal himself into a man's favour and
 for a week escape a great deal of discoveries but
 when you find him out you have him ever after
bertram why do you think he will make no deed at all of
 this that so seriously he does address himself unto
second lord none in the world but return with an invention and
 clap upon you two or three probable lies but we
 have almost embossed him you shall see his fall
 tonight for indeed he is not for your lordship's respect
first lord we'll make you some sport with the fox ere we case
 him he was first smoked by the old lord lafeu
 when his disguise and he is parted tell me what a
 sprat you shall find him which you shall see this
 very night
second lord i must go look my twigs he shall be caught
bertram your brother he shall go along with me
second lord as't please your lordship i'll leave you
 exit
bertram now will i lead you to the house and show you
 the lass i spoke of
first lord but you say she's honest
bertram that's all the fault i spoke with her but once
 and found her wondrous cold but i sent to her
 by this same coxcomb that we have i the wind
 tokens and letters which she did resend
 and this is all i have done she's a fair creature
 will you go see her
first lord with all my heart my lord
 exeunt
 all's well that ends well
act iii
scene vii florence the widow's house
 enter helena and widow
helena if you misdoubt me that i am not she
 i know not how i shall assure you further
 but i shall lose the grounds i work upon
widow though my estate be fallen i was well born
 nothing acquainted with these businesses
 and would not put my reputation now
 in any staining act
helena nor would i wish you
 first give me trust the count he is my husband
 and what to your sworn counsel i have spoken
 is so from word to word and then you cannot
 by the good aid that i of you shall borrow
 err in bestowing it
widow i should believe you
 for you have show'd me that which well approves
 you're great in fortune
helena take this purse of gold
 and let me buy your friendly help thus far
 which i will overpay and pay again
 when i have found it the count he wooes your daughter
 lays down his wanton siege before her beauty
 resolved to carry her let her in fine consent
 as we'll direct her how tis best to bear it
 now his important blood will nought deny
 that she'll demand a ring the county wears
 that downward hath succeeded in his house
 from son to son some four or five descents
 since the first father wore it this ring he holds
 in most rich choice yet in his idle fire
 to buy his will it would not seem too dear
 howe'er repented after
widow now i see
 the bottom of your purpose
helena you see it lawful then it is no more
 but that your daughter ere she seems as won
 desires this ring appoints him an encounter
 in fine delivers me to fill the time
 herself most chastely absent after this
 to marry her i'll add three thousand crowns
 to what is passed already
widow i have yielded
 instruct my daughter how she shall persever
 that time and place with this deceit so lawful
 may prove coherent every night he comes
 with musics of all sorts and songs composed
 to her unworthiness it nothing steads us
 to chide him from our eaves for he persists
 as if his life lay on't
helena why then tonight
 let us assay our plot which if it speed
 is wicked meaning in a lawful deed
 and lawful meaning in a lawful act
 where both not sin and yet a sinful fact
 but let's about it
 exeunt
 all's well that ends well
act iv
scene i without the florentine camp
 enter second french lord with five or six other
 soldiers in ambush
second lord he can come no other way but by this hedgecorner
 when you sally upon him speak what terrible
 language you will though you understand it not
 yourselves no matter for we must not seem to
 understand him unless some one among us whom we
 must produce for an interpreter
first soldier good captain let me be the interpreter
second lord art not acquainted with him knows he not thy voice
first soldier no sir i warrant you
second lord but what linseywoolsey hast thou to speak to us again
first soldier e'en such as you speak to me
second lord he must think us some band of strangers i the
 adversary's entertainment now he hath a smack of
 all neighbouring languages therefore we must every
 one be a man of his own fancy not to know what we
 speak one to another so we seem to know is to
 know straight our purpose choughs language
 gabble enough and good enough as for you
 interpreter you must seem very politic but couch
 ho here he comes to beguile two hours in a sleep
 and then to return and swear the lies he forges
 enter parolles
parolles ten o'clock within these three hours twill be
 time enough to go home what shall i say i have
 done it must be a very plausive invention that
 carries it they begin to smoke me and disgraces
 have of late knocked too often at my door i find
 my tongue is too foolhardy but my heart hath the
 fear of mars before it and of his creatures not
 daring the reports of my tongue
second lord this is the first truth that e'er thine own tongue
 was guilty of
parolles what the devil should move me to undertake the
 recovery of this drum being not ignorant of the
 impossibility and knowing i had no such purpose i
 must give myself some hurts and say i got them in
 exploit yet slight ones will not carry it they
 will say came you off with so little and great
 ones i dare not give wherefore what's the
 instance tongue i must put you into a
 butterwoman's mouth and buy myself another of
 bajazet's mule if you prattle me into these perils
second lord is it possible he should know what he is and be
 that he is
parolles i would the cutting of my garments would serve the
 turn or the breaking of my spanish sword
second lord we cannot afford you so
parolles or the baring of my beard and to say it was in
 stratagem
second lord twould not do
parolles or to drown my clothes and say i was stripped
second lord hardly serve
parolles though i swore i leaped from the window of the citadel
second lord how deep
parolles thirty fathom
second lord three great oaths would scarce make that be believed
parolles i would i had any drum of the enemy's i would swear
 i recovered it
second lord you shall hear one anon
parolles a drum now of the enemy's
 alarum within
second lord throca movousus cargo cargo cargo
all cargo cargo cargo villiando par corbo cargo
parolles o ransom ransom do not hide mine eyes
 they seize and blindfold him
first soldier boskos thromuldo boskos
parolles i know you are the muskos regiment
 and i shall lose my life for want of language
 if there be here german or dane low dutch
 italian or french let him speak to me i'll
 discover that which shall undo the florentine
first soldier boskos vauvado i understand thee and can speak
 thy tongue kerely bonto sir betake thee to thy
 faith for seventeen poniards are at thy bosom
parolles o
first soldier o pray pray pray manka revania dulche
second lord oscorbidulchos volivorco
