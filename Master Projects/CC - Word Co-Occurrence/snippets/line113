therefore thus saith the lord behold against this family do i devise an evil from which ye shall not remove your necks neither shall ye go haughtily for this time is evil
in that day shall one take up a parable against you and lament with a doleful lamentation and say we be utterly spoiled he hath changed the portion of my people how hath he removed it from me turning away he hath divided our fields
therefore thou shalt have none that shall cast a cord by lot in the congregation of the lord
prophesy ye not say they to them that prophesy they shall not prophesy to them that they shall not take shame
o thou that art named the house of jacob is the spirit of the lord straitened are these his doings do not my words do good to him that walketh uprightly
even of late my people is risen up as an enemy ye pull off the robe with the garment from them that pass by securely as men averse from war
the women of my people have ye cast out from their pleasant houses from their children have ye taken away my glory for ever
arise ye and depart for this is not your rest because it is polluted it shall destroy you even with a sore destruction
if a man walking in the spirit and falsehood do lie saying i will prophesy unto thee of wine and of strong drink he shall even be the prophet of this people
i will surely assemble o jacob all of thee i will surely gather the remnant of israel i will put them together as the sheep of bozrah as the flock in the midst of their fold they shall make great noise by reason of the multitude of men
the breaker is come up before them they have broken up and have passed through the gate and are gone out by it and their king shall pass before them and the lord on the head of them
and i said hear i pray you o heads of jacob and ye princes of the house of israel is it not for you to know judgment
who hate the good and love the evil who pluck off their skin from off them and their flesh from off their bones
who also eat the flesh of my people and flay their skin from off them and they break their bones and chop them in pieces as for the pot and as flesh within the caldron
then shall they cry unto the lord but he will not hear them he will even hide his face from them at that time as they have behaved themselves ill in their doings
thus saith the lord concerning the prophets that make my people err that bite with their teeth and cry peace and he that putteth not into their mouths they even prepare war against him
therefore night shall be unto you that ye shall not have a vision and it shall be dark unto you that ye shall not divine and the sun shall go down over the prophets and the day shall be dark over them
then shall the seers be ashamed and the diviners confounded yea they shall all cover their lips for there is no answer of god
but truly i am full of power by the spirit of the lord and of judgment and of might to declare unto jacob his transgression and to israel his sin
hear this i pray you ye heads of the house of jacob and princes of the house of israel that abhor judgment and pervert all equity
they build up zion with blood and jerusalem with iniquity
the heads thereof judge for reward and the priests thereof teach for hire and the prophets thereof divine for money yet will they lean upon the lord and say is not the lord among us none evil can come upon us
therefore shall zion for your sake be plowed as a field and jerusalem shall become heaps and the mountain of the house as the high places of the forest
but in the last days it shall come to pass that the mountain of the house of the lord shall be established in the top of the mountains and it shall be exalted above the hills and people shall flow unto it
and many nations shall come and say come and let us go up to the mountain of the lord and to the house of the god of jacob and he will teach us of his ways and we will walk in his paths for the law shall go forth of zion and the word of the lord from jerusalem
and he shall judge among many people and rebuke strong nations afar off and they shall beat their swords into plowshares and their spears into pruninghooks nation shall not lift up a sword against nation neither shall they learn war any more
but they shall sit every man under his vine and under his fig tree and none shall make them afraid for the mouth of the lord of hosts hath spoken it
for all people will walk every one in the name of his god and we will walk in the name of the lord our god for ever and ever
in that day saith the lord will i assemble her that halteth and i will gather her that is driven out and her that i have afflicted
and i will make her that halted a remnant and her that was cast far off a strong nation and the lord shall reign over them in mount zion from henceforth even for ever
and thou o tower of the flock the strong hold of the daughter of zion unto thee shall it come even the first dominion the kingdom shall come to the daughter of jerusalem
now why dost thou cry out aloud is there no king in thee is thy counsellor perished for pangs have taken thee as a woman in travail
be in pain and labour to bring forth o daughter of zion like a woman in travail for now shalt thou go forth out of the city and thou shalt dwell in the field and thou shalt go even to babylon there shalt thou be delivered there the lord shall redeem thee from the hand of thine enemies
now also many nations are gathered against thee that say let her be defiled and let our eye look upon zion
but they know not the thoughts of the lord neither understand they his counsel for he shall gather them as the sheaves into the floor
arise and thresh o daughter of zion for i will make thine horn iron and i will make thy hoofs brass and thou shalt beat in pieces many people and i will consecrate their gain unto the lord and their substance unto the lord of the whole earth
now gather thyself in troops o daughter of troops he hath laid siege against us they shall smite the judge of israel with a rod upon the cheek
but thou bethlehem ephratah though thou be little among the thousands of judah yet out of thee shall he come forth unto me that is to be ruler in israel whose goings forth have been from of old from everlasting
therefore will he give them up until the time that she which travaileth hath brought forth then the remnant of his brethren shall return unto the children of israel
and he shall stand and feed in the strength of the lord in the majesty of the name of the lord his god and they shall abide for now shall he be great unto the ends of the earth
and this man shall be the peace when the assyrian shall come into our land and when he shall tread in our palaces then shall we raise against him seven shepherds and eight principal men
and they shall waste the land of assyria with the sword and the land of nimrod in the entrances thereof thus shall he deliver us from the assyrian when he cometh into our land and when he treadeth within our borders
and the remnant of jacob shall be in the midst of many people as a dew from the lord as the showers upon the grass that tarrieth not for man nor waiteth for the sons of men
and the remnant of jacob shall be among the gentiles in the midst of many people as a lion among the beasts of the forest as a young lion among the flocks of sheep who if he go through both treadeth down and teareth in pieces and none can deliver
thine hand shall be lifted up upon thine adversaries and all thine enemies shall be cut off
and it shall come to pass in that day saith the lord that i will cut off thy horses out of the midst of thee and i will destroy thy chariots
and i will cut off the cities of thy land and throw down all thy strong holds
and i will cut off witchcrafts out of thine hand and thou shalt have no more soothsayers
thy graven images also will i cut off and thy standing images out of the midst of thee and thou shalt no more worship the work of thine hands
and i will pluck up thy groves out of the midst of thee so will i destroy thy cities
and i will execute vengeance in anger and fury upon the heathen such as they have not heard
hear ye now what the lord saith arise contend thou before the mountains and let the hills hear thy voice
hear ye o mountains the lord's controversy and ye strong foundations of the earth for the lord hath a controversy with his people and he will plead with israel
o my people what have i done unto thee and wherein have i wearied thee testify against me
for i brought thee up out of the land of egypt and redeemed thee out of the house of servants and i sent before thee moses aaron and miriam
o my people remember now what balak king of moab consulted and what balaam the son of beor answered him from shittim unto gilgal that ye may know the righteousness of the lord
wherewith shall i come before the lord and bow myself before the high god shall i come before him with burnt offerings with calves of a year old
will the lord be pleased with thousands of rams or with ten thousands of rivers of oil shall i give my firstborn for my transgression the fruit of my body for the sin of my soul
he hath shewed thee o man what is good and what doth the lord require of thee but to do justly and to love mercy and to walk humbly with thy god
the lord's voice crieth unto the city and the man of wisdom shall see thy name hear ye the rod and who hath appointed it
are there yet the treasures of wickedness in the house of the wicked and the scant measure that is abominable
shall i count them pure with the wicked balances and with the bag of deceitful weights
for the rich men thereof are full of violence and the inhabitants thereof have spoken lies and their tongue is deceitful in their mouth
therefore also will i make thee sick in smiting thee in making thee desolate because of thy sins
thou shalt eat but not be satisfied and thy casting down shall be in the midst of thee and thou shalt take hold but shalt not deliver and that which thou deliverest will i give up to the sword
thou shalt sow but thou shalt not reap thou shalt tread the olives but thou shalt not anoint thee with oil and sweet wine but shalt not drink wine
for the statutes of omri are kept and all the works of the house of ahab and ye walk in their counsels that i should make thee a desolation and the inhabitants thereof an hissing therefore ye shall bear the reproach of my people
woe is me for i am as when they have gathered the summer fruits as the grapegleanings of the vintage there is no cluster to eat my soul desired the firstripe fruit
the good man is perished out of the earth and there is none upright among men they all lie in wait for blood they hunt every man his brother with a net
that they may do evil with both hands earnestly the prince asketh and the judge asketh for a reward and the great man he uttereth his mischievous desire so they wrap it up
the best of them is as a brier the most upright is sharper than a thorn hedge the day of thy watchmen and thy visitation cometh now shall be their perplexity
trust ye not in a friend put ye not confidence in a guide keep the doors of thy mouth from her that lieth in thy bosom
for the son dishonoureth the father the daughter riseth up against her mother the daughter in law against her mother in law a man's enemies are the men of his own house
therefore i will look unto the lord i will wait for the god of my salvation my god will hear me
rejoice not against me o mine enemy when i fall i shall arise when i sit in darkness the lord shall be a light unto me
i will bear the indignation of the lord because i have sinned against him until he plead my cause and execute judgment for me he will bring me forth to the light and i shall behold his righteousness
then she that is mine enemy shall see it and shame shall cover her which said unto me where is the lord thy god mine eyes shall behold her now shall she be trodden down as the mire of the streets
in the day that thy walls are to be built in that day shall the decree be far removed
in that day also he shall come even to thee from assyria and from the fortified cities and from the fortress even to the river and from sea to sea and from mountain to mountain
notwithstanding the land shall be desolate because of them that dwell therein for the fruit of their doings
feed thy people with thy rod the flock of thine heritage which dwell solitarily in the wood in the midst of carmel let them feed in bashan and gilead as in the days of old
according to the days of thy coming out of the land of egypt will i shew unto him marvellous things
the nations shall see and be confounded at all their might they shall lay their hand upon their mouth their ears shall be deaf
they shall lick the dust like a serpent they shall move out of their holes like worms of the earth they shall be afraid of the lord our god and shall fear because of thee
who is a god like unto thee that pardoneth iniquity and passeth by the transgression of the remnant of his heritage he retaineth not his anger for ever because he delighteth in mercy
he will turn again he will have compassion upon us he will subdue our iniquities and thou wilt cast all their sins into the depths of the sea
thou wilt perform the truth to jacob and the mercy to abraham which thou hast sworn unto our fathers from the days of old
the burden of nineveh the book of the vision of nahum the elkoshite
god is jealous and the lord revengeth the lord revengeth and is furious the lord will take vengeance on his adversaries and he reserveth wrath for his enemies
the lord is slow to anger and great in power and will not at all acquit the wicked the lord hath his way in the whirlwind and in the storm and the clouds are the dust of his feet
he rebuketh the sea and maketh it dry and drieth up all the rivers bashan languisheth and carmel and the flower of lebanon languisheth
the mountains quake at him and the hills melt and the earth is burned at his presence yea the world and all that dwell therein
who can stand before his indignation and who can abide in the fierceness of his anger his fury is poured out like fire and the rocks are thrown down by him
the lord is good a strong hold in the day of trouble and he knoweth them that trust in him
but with an overrunning flood he will make an utter end of the place thereof and darkness shall pursue his enemies
what do ye imagine against the lord he will make an utter end affliction shall not rise up the second time
for while they be folden together as thorns and while they are drunken as drunkards they shall be devoured as stubble fully dry
there is one come out of thee that imagineth evil against the lord a wicked counsellor
thus saith the lord though they be quiet and likewise many yet thus shall they be cut down when he shall pass through though i have afflicted thee i will afflict thee no more
for now will i break his yoke from off thee and will burst thy bonds in sunder
and the lord hath given a commandment concerning thee that no more of thy name be sown out of the house of thy gods will i cut off the graven image and the molten image i will make thy grave for thou art vile
behold upon the mountains the feet of him that bringeth good tidings that publisheth peace o judah keep thy solemn feasts perform thy vows for the wicked shall no more pass through thee he is utterly cut off
he that dasheth in pieces is come up before thy face keep the munition watch the way make thy loins strong fortify thy power mightily
for the lord hath turned away the excellency of jacob as the excellency of israel for the emptiers have emptied them out and marred their vine branches
the shield of his mighty men is made red the valiant men are in scarlet the chariots shall be with flaming torches in the day of his preparation and the fir trees shall be terribly shaken
the chariots shall rage in the streets they shall justle one against another in the broad ways they shall seem like torches they shall run like the lightnings
he shall recount his worthies they shall stumble in their walk they shall make haste to the wall thereof and the defence shall be prepared
the gates of the rivers shall be opened and the palace shall be dissolved
and huzzab shall be led away captive she shall be brought up and her maids shall lead her as with the voice of doves tabering upon their breasts
but nineveh is of old like a pool of water yet they shall flee away stand stand shall they cry but none shall look back
take ye the spoil of silver take the spoil of gold for there is none end of the store and glory out of all the pleasant furniture
she is empty and void and waste and the heart melteth and the knees smite together and much pain is in all loins and the faces of them all gather blackness
where is the dwelling of the lions and the feedingplace of the young lions where the lion even the old lion walked and the lion's whelp and none made them afraid
the lion did tear in pieces enough for his whelps and strangled for his lionesses and filled his holes with prey and his dens with ravin
behold i am against thee saith the lord of hosts and i will burn her chariots in the smoke and the sword shall devour thy young lions and i will cut off thy prey from the earth and the voice of thy messengers shall no more be heard
woe to the bloody city it is all full of lies and robbery the prey departeth not
the noise of a whip and the noise of the rattling of the wheels and of the pransing horses and of the jumping chariots
the horseman lifteth up both the bright sword and the glittering spear and there is a multitude of slain and a great number of carcases and there is none end of their corpses they stumble upon their corpses
because of the multitude of the whoredoms of the wellfavoured harlot the mistress of witchcrafts that selleth nations through her whoredoms and families through her witchcrafts
behold i am against thee saith the lord of hosts and i will discover thy skirts upon thy face and i will shew the nations thy nakedness and the kingdoms thy shame
and i will cast abominable filth upon thee and make thee vile and will set thee as a gazingstock
and it shall come to pass that all they that look upon thee shall flee from thee and say nineveh is laid waste who will bemoan her whence shall i seek comforters for thee
art thou better than populous no that was situate among the rivers that had the waters round about it whose rampart was the sea and her wall was from the sea
ethiopia and egypt were her strength and it was infinite put and lubim were thy helpers
yet was she carried away she went into captivity her young children also were dashed in pieces at the top of all the streets and they cast lots for her honourable men and all her great men were bound in chains
thou also shalt be drunken thou shalt be hid thou also shalt seek strength because of the enemy
all thy strong holds shall be like fig trees with the firstripe figs if they be shaken they shall even fall into the mouth of the eater
behold thy people in the midst of thee are women the gates of thy land shall be set wide open unto thine enemies the fire shall devour thy bars
draw thee waters for the siege fortify thy strong holds go into clay and tread the morter make strong the brickkiln
there shall the fire devour thee the sword shall cut thee off it shall eat thee up like the cankerworm make thyself many as the cankerworm make thyself many as the locusts
thou hast multiplied thy merchants above the stars of heaven the cankerworm spoileth and fleeth away
thy crowned are as the locusts and thy captains as the great grasshoppers which camp in the hedges in the cold day but when the sun ariseth they flee away and their place is not known where they are
thy shepherds slumber o king of assyria thy nobles shall dwell in the dust thy people is scattered upon the mountains and no man gathereth them
there is no healing of thy bruise thy wound is grievous all that hear the bruit of thee shall clap the hands over thee for upon whom hath not thy wickedness passed continually
the burden which habakkuk the prophet did see
o lord how long shall i cry and thou wilt not hear even cry out unto thee of violence and thou wilt not save
why dost thou shew me iniquity and cause me to behold grievance for spoiling and violence are before me and there are that raise up strife and contention
therefore the law is slacked and judgment doth never go forth for the wicked doth compass about the righteous therefore wrong judgment proceedeth
behold ye among the heathen and regard and wonder marvellously for i will work a work in your days which ye will not believe though it be told you
for lo i raise up the chaldeans that bitter and hasty nation which shall march through the breadth of the land to possess the dwellingplaces that are not theirs
they are terrible and dreadful their judgment and their dignity shall proceed of themselves
their horses also are swifter than the leopards and are more fierce than the evening wolves and their horsemen shall spread themselves and their horsemen shall come from far they shall fly as the eagle that hasteth to eat
they shall come all for violence their faces shall sup up as the east wind and they shall gather the captivity as the sand
and they shall scoff at the kings and the princes shall be a scorn unto them they shall deride every strong hold for they shall heap dust and take it
then shall his mind change and he shall pass over and offend imputing this his power unto his god
art thou not from everlasting o lord my god mine holy one we shall not die o lord thou hast ordained them for judgment and o mighty god thou hast established them for correction
thou art of purer eyes than to behold evil and canst not look on iniquity wherefore lookest thou upon them that deal treacherously and holdest thy tongue when the wicked devoureth the man that is more righteous than he
and makest men as the fishes of the sea as the creeping things that have no ruler over them
they take up all of them with the angle they catch them in their net and gather them in their drag therefore they rejoice and are glad
therefore they sacrifice unto their net and burn incense unto their drag because by them their portion is fat and their meat plenteous
shall they therefore empty their net and not spare continually to slay the nations
i will stand upon my watch and set me upon the tower and will watch to see what he will say unto me and what i shall answer when i am reproved
and the lord answered me and said write the vision and make it plain upon tables that he may run that readeth it
for the vision is yet for an appointed time but at the end it shall speak and not lie though it tarry wait for it because it will surely come it will not tarry
behold his soul which is lifted up is not upright in him but the just shall live by his faith
yea also because he transgresseth by wine he is a proud man neither keepeth at home who enlargeth his desire as hell and is as death and cannot be satisfied but gathereth unto him all nations and heapeth unto him all people
shall not all these take up a parable against him and a taunting proverb against him and say woe to him that increaseth that which is not his how long and to him that ladeth himself with thick clay
shall they not rise up suddenly that shall bite thee and awake that shall vex thee and thou shalt be for booties unto them
because thou hast spoiled many nations all the remnant of the people shall spoil thee because of men's blood and for the violence of the land of the city and of all that dwell therein
woe to him that coveteth an evil covetousness to his house that he may set his nest on high that he may be delivered from the power of evil

for the violence of lebanon shall cover thee and the spoil of beasts which made them afraid because of men's blood and for the violence of the land of the city and of all that dwell therein
what profiteth the graven image that the maker thereof hath graven it the molten image and a teacher of lies that the maker of his work trusteth therein to make dumb idols
woe unto him that saith to the wood awake to the dumb stone arise it shall teach behold it is laid over with gold and silver and there is no breath at all in the midst of it
but the lord is in his holy temple let all the earth keep silence before him
a prayer of habakkuk the prophet upon shigionoth
o lord i have heard thy speech and was afraid o lord revive thy work in the midst of the years in the midst of the years make known in wrath remember mercy
god came from teman and the holy one from mount paran selah his glory covered the heavens and the earth was full of his praise
and his brightness was as the light he had horns coming out of his hand and there was the hiding of his power
before him went the pestilence and burning coals went forth at his feet
he stood and measured the earth he beheld and drove asunder the nations and the everlasting mountains were scattered the perpetual hills did bow his ways are everlasting
i saw the tents of cushan in affliction and the curtains of the land of midian did tremble
was the lord displeased against the rivers was thine anger against the rivers was thy wrath against the sea that thou didst ride upon thine horses and thy chariots of salvation
thy bow was made quite naked according to the oaths of the tribes even thy word selah thou didst cleave the earth with rivers
the mountains saw thee and they trembled the overflowing of the water passed by the deep uttered his voice and lifted up his hands on high
the sun and moon stood still in their habitation at the light of thine arrows they went and at the shining of thy glittering spear
thou didst march through the land in indignation thou didst thresh the heathen in anger
thou wentest forth for the salvation of thy people even for salvation with thine anointed thou woundedst the head out of the house of the wicked by discovering the foundation unto the neck selah
thou didst strike through with his staves the head of his villages they came out as a whirlwind to scatter me their rejoicing was as to devour the poor secretly
thou didst walk through the sea with thine horses through the heap of great waters
when i heard my belly trembled my lips quivered at the voice rottenness entered into my bones and i trembled in myself that i might rest in the day of trouble when he cometh up unto the people he will invade them with his troops
although the fig tree shall not blossom neither shall fruit be in the vines the labour of the olive shall fail and the fields shall yield no meat the flock shall be cut off from the fold and there shall be no herd in the stalls
yet i will rejoice in the lord i will joy in the god of my salvation
the lord god is my strength and he will make my feet like hinds feet and he will make me to walk upon mine high places to the chief singer on my stringed instruments
the word of the lord which came unto zephaniah the son of cushi the son of gedaliah the son of amariah the son of hizkiah in the days of josiah the son of amon king of judah
i will utterly consume all things from off the land saith the lord
i will consume man and beast i will consume the fowls of the heaven and the fishes of the sea and the stumbling blocks with the wicked and i will cut off man from off the land saith the lord
i will also stretch out mine hand upon judah and upon all the inhabitants of jerusalem and i will cut off the remnant of baal from this place and the name of the chemarims with the priests
and them that worship the host of heaven upon the housetops and them that worship and that swear by the lord and that swear by malcham
and them that are turned back from the lord and those that have not sought the lord nor enquired for him
hold thy peace at the presence of the lord god for the day of the lord is at hand for the lord hath prepared a sacrifice he hath bid his guests
and it shall come to pass in the day of the lord's sacrifice that i will punish the princes and the king's children and all such as are clothed with strange apparel
in the same day also will i punish all those that leap on the threshold which fill their masters houses with violence and deceit
and it shall come to pass in that day saith the lord that there shall be the noise of a cry from the fish gate and an howling from the second and a great crashing from the hills
