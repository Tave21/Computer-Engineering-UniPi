 stuck in ears you might have pinched a placket it
 was senseless twas nothing to geld a codpiece of a
 purse i could have filed keys off that hung in
 chains no hearing no feeling but my sir's song
 and admiring the nothing of it so that in this
 time of lethargy i picked and cut most of their
 festival purses and had not the old man come in
 with a whoobub against his daughter and the king's
 son and scared my choughs from the chaff i had not
 left a purse alive in the whole army
 camillo florizel and perdita come forward
camillo nay but my letters by this means being there
 so soon as you arrive shall clear that doubt
florizel and those that you'll procure from king leontes
camillo shall satisfy your father
perdita happy be you
 all that you speak shows fair
camillo who have we here
 seeing autolycus
 we'll make an instrument of this omit
 nothing may give us aid
autolycus if they have overheard me now why hanging
camillo how now good fellow why shakest thou so fear
 not man here's no harm intended to thee
autolycus i am a poor fellow sir
camillo why be so still here's nobody will steal that from
 thee yet for the outside of thy poverty we must
 make an exchange therefore discase thee instantly
 thou must think there's a necessity in'tand
 change garments with this gentleman though the
 pennyworth on his side be the worst yet hold thee
 there's some boot
autolycus i am a poor fellow sir
 aside
 i know ye well enough
camillo nay prithee dispatch the gentleman is half
 flayed already
autolycus are you in earnest sir
 aside
 i smell the trick on't
florizel dispatch i prithee
autolycus indeed i have had earnest but i cannot with
 conscience take it
camillo unbuckle unbuckle
 florizel and autolycus exchange garments
 fortunate mistresslet my prophecy
 come home to yeyou must retire yourself
 into some covert take your sweetheart's hat
 and pluck it o'er your brows muffle your face
 dismantle you and as you can disliken
 the truth of your own seeming that you may
 for i do fear eyes overto shipboard
 get undescried
perdita i see the play so lies
 that i must bear a part
camillo no remedy
 have you done there
florizel should i now meet my father
 he would not call me son
camillo nay you shall have no hat
 giving it to perdita
 come lady come farewell my friend
autolycus adieu sir
florizel o perdita what have we twain forgot
 pray you a word
camillo aside what i do next shall be to tell the king
 of this escape and whither they are bound
 wherein my hope is i shall so prevail
 to force him after in whose company
 i shall review sicilia for whose sight
 i have a woman's longing
florizel fortune speed us
 thus we set on camillo to the seaside
camillo the swifter speed the better
 exeunt florizel perdita and camillo
autolycus i understand the business i hear it to have an
 open ear a quick eye and a nimble hand is
 necessary for a cutpurse a good nose is requisite
 also to smell out work for the other senses i see
 this is the time that the unjust man doth thrive
 what an exchange had this been without boot what
 a boot is here with this exchange sure the gods do
 this year connive at us and we may do any thing
 extempore the prince himself is about a piece of
 iniquity stealing away from his father with his
 clog at his heels if i thought it were a piece of
 honesty to acquaint the king withal i would not
 do't i hold it the more knavery to conceal it
 and therein am i constant to my profession
 reenter clown and shepherd
 aside aside here is more matter for a hot brain
 every lane's end every shop church session
 hanging yields a careful man work
clown see see what a man you are now
 there is no other way but to tell the king
 she's a changeling and none of your flesh and blood
shepherd nay but hear me
clown nay but hear me
shepherd go to then
clown she being none of your flesh and blood your flesh
 and blood has not offended the king and so your
 flesh and blood is not to be punished by him show
 those things you found about her those secret
 things all but what she has with her this being
 done let the law go whistle i warrant you
shepherd i will tell the king all every word yea and his
 son's pranks too who i may say is no honest man
 neither to his father nor to me to go about to make
 me the king's brotherinlaw
clown indeed brotherinlaw was the farthest off you
 could have been to him and then your blood had been
 the dearer by i know how much an ounce
autolycus aside very wisely puppies
shepherd well let us to the king there is that in this
 fardel will make him scratch his beard
autolycus aside i know not what impediment this complaint
 may be to the flight of my master
clown pray heartily he be at palace
autolycus aside though i am not naturally honest i am so
 sometimes by chance let me pocket up my pedlar's excrement
 takes off his false beard
 how now rustics whither are you bound
shepherd to the palace an it like your worship
autolycus your affairs there what with whom the condition
 of that fardel the place of your dwelling your
 names your ages of what having breeding and any
 thing that is fitting to be known discover
clown we are but plain fellows sir
autolycus a lie you are rough and hairy let me have no
 lying it becomes none but tradesmen and they
 often give us soldiers the lie but we pay them for
 it with stamped coin not stabbing steel therefore
 they do not give us the lie
clown your worship had like to have given us one if you
 had not taken yourself with the manner
shepherd are you a courtier an't like you sir
autolycus whether it like me or no i am a courtier seest
 thou not the air of the court in these enfoldings
 hath not my gait in it the measure of the court
 receives not thy nose courtodor from me reflect i
 not on thy baseness courtcontempt thinkest thou
 for that i insinuate or toaze from thee thy
 business i am therefore no courtier i am courtier
 capape and one that will either push on or pluck
 back thy business there whereupon i command thee to
 open thy affair
shepherd my business sir is to the king
autolycus what advocate hast thou to him
shepherd i know not an't like you
clown advocate's the courtword for a pheasant say you
 have none
shepherd none sir i have no pheasant cock nor hen
autolycus how blessed are we that are not simple men
 yet nature might have made me as these are
 therefore i will not disdain
clown this cannot be but a great courtier
shepherd his garments are rich but he wears
 them not handsomely
clown he seems to be the more noble in being fantastical
 a great man i'll warrant i know by the picking
 on's teeth
autolycus the fardel there what's i the fardel
 wherefore that box
shepherd sir there lies such secrets in this fardel and box
 which none must know but the king and which he
 shall know within this hour if i may come to the
 speech of him
autolycus age thou hast lost thy labour
shepherd why sir
autolycus the king is not at the palace he is gone aboard a
 new ship to purge melancholy and air himself for
 if thou beest capable of things serious thou must
 know the king is full of grief
shepard so tis said sir about his son that should have
 married a shepherd's daughter
autolycus if that shepherd be not in handfast let him fly
 the curses he shall have the tortures he shall
 feel will break the back of man the heart of monster
clown think you so sir
autolycus not he alone shall suffer what wit can make heavy
 and vengeance bitter but those that are germane to
 him though removed fifty times shall all come
 under the hangman which though it be great pity
 yet it is necessary an old sheepwhistling rogue a
 ramtender to offer to have his daughter come into
 grace some say he shall be stoned but that death
 is too soft for him say i draw our throne into a
 sheepcote all deaths are too few the sharpest too easy
clown has the old man e'er a son sir do you hear an't
 like you sir
autolycus he has a son who shall be flayed alive then
 nointed over with honey set on the head of a
 wasp's nest then stand till he be three quarters
 and a dram dead then recovered again with
 aquavitae or some other hot infusion then raw as
 he is and in the hottest day prognostication
 proclaims shall be be set against a brickwall the
 sun looking with a southward eye upon him where he
 is to behold him with flies blown to death but what
 talk we of these traitorly rascals whose miseries
