 hanging a golden stamp about their necks
 put on with holy prayers and tis spoken
 to the succeeding royalty he leaves
 the healing benediction with this strange virtue
 he hath a heavenly gift of prophecy
 and sundry blessings hang about his throne
 that speak him full of grace
 enter ross
macduff see who comes here
malcolm my countryman but yet i know him not
macduff my evergentle cousin welcome hither
malcolm i know him now good god betimes remove
 the means that makes us strangers
ross sir amen
macduff stands scotland where it did
ross alas poor country
 almost afraid to know itself it cannot
 be call'd our mother but our grave where nothing
 but who knows nothing is once seen to smile
 where sighs and groans and shrieks that rend the air
 are made not mark'd where violent sorrow seems
 a modern ecstasy the dead man's knell
 is there scarce ask'd for who and good men's lives
 expire before the flowers in their caps
 dying or ere they sicken
macduff o relation
 too nice and yet too true
malcolm what's the newest grief
ross that of an hour's age doth hiss the speaker
 each minute teems a new one
macduff how does my wife
ross why well
macduff and all my children
ross well too
macduff the tyrant has not batter'd at their peace
ross no they were well at peace when i did leave em
macduff but not a niggard of your speech how goes't
ross when i came hither to transport the tidings
 which i have heavily borne there ran a rumour
 of many worthy fellows that were out
 which was to my belief witness'd the rather
 for that i saw the tyrant's power afoot
 now is the time of help your eye in scotland
 would create soldiers make our women fight
 to doff their dire distresses
malcolm be't their comfort
 we are coming thither gracious england hath
 lent us good siward and ten thousand men
 an older and a better soldier none
 that christendom gives out
ross would i could answer
 this comfort with the like but i have words
 that would be howl'd out in the desert air
 where hearing should not latch them
macduff what concern they
 the general cause or is it a feegrief
 due to some single breast
ross no mind that's honest
 but in it shares some woe though the main part
 pertains to you alone
macduff if it be mine
 keep it not from me quickly let me have it
ross let not your ears despise my tongue for ever
 which shall possess them with the heaviest sound
 that ever yet they heard
macduff hum i guess at it
ross your castle is surprised your wife and babes
 savagely slaughter'd to relate the manner
 were on the quarry of these murder'd deer
 to add the death of you
malcolm merciful heaven
 what man ne'er pull your hat upon your brows
 give sorrow words the grief that does not speak
 whispers the o'erfraught heart and bids it break
macduff my children too
ross wife children servants all
 that could be found
macduff and i must be from thence
 my wife kill'd too
ross i have said
malcolm be comforted
 let's make us medicines of our great revenge
 to cure this deadly grief
macduff he has no children all my pretty ones
 did you say all o hellkite all
 what all my pretty chickens and their dam
 at one fell swoop
malcolm dispute it like a man
macduff i shall do so
 but i must also feel it as a man
 i cannot but remember such things were
 that were most precious to me did heaven look on
 and would not take their part sinful macduff
 they were all struck for thee naught that i am
 not for their own demerits but for mine
 fell slaughter on their souls heaven rest them now
malcolm be this the whetstone of your sword let grief
 convert to anger blunt not the heart enrage it
macduff o i could play the woman with mine eyes
 and braggart with my tongue but gentle heavens
 cut short all intermission front to front
 bring thou this fiend of scotland and myself
 within my sword's length set him if he scape
 heaven forgive him too
malcolm this tune goes manly
 come go we to the king our power is ready
 our lack is nothing but our leave macbeth
 is ripe for shaking and the powers above
 put on their instruments receive what cheer you may
 the night is long that never finds the day

act v
scene i dunsinane anteroom in the castle
 enter a doctor of physic and a waitinggentlewoman
doctor i have two nights watched with you but can perceive
 no truth in your report when was it she last walked
gentlewoman since his majesty went into the field i have seen
 her rise from her bed throw her nightgown upon
 her unlock her closet take forth paper fold it
 write upon't read it afterwards seal it and again
 return to bed yet all this while in a most fast sleep
doctor a great perturbation in nature to receive at once
 the benefit of sleep and do the effects of
 watching in this slumbery agitation besides her
 walking and other actual performances what at any
 time have you heard her say
gentlewoman that sir which i will not report after her
doctor you may to me and tis most meet you should
gentlewoman neither to you nor any one having no witness to
 confirm my speech
 enter lady macbeth with a taper
 lo you here she comes this is her very guise
 and upon my life fast asleep observe her stand close
doctor how came she by that light
gentlewoman why it stood by her she has light by her
 continually tis her command
doctor you see her eyes are open
gentlewoman ay but their sense is shut
doctor what is it she does now look how she rubs her hands
gentlewoman it is an accustomed action with her to seem thus
 washing her hands i have known her continue in
 this a quarter of an hour
lady macbeth yet here's a spot
doctor hark she speaks i will set down what comes from
 her to satisfy my remembrance the more strongly
lady macbeth out damned spot out i sayone two why
 then tis time to do'thell is murkyfie my
 lord fie a soldier and afeard what need we
 fear who knows it when none can call our power to
 accountyet who would have thought the old man
 to have had so much blood in him
doctor do you mark that
lady macbeth the thane of fife had a wife where is she now
 what will these hands ne'er be cleanno more o'
 that my lord no more o that you mar all with
 this starting
doctor go to go to you have known what you should not
gentlewoman she has spoke what she should not i am sure of
 that heaven knows what she has known
lady macbeth here's the smell of the blood still all the
 perfumes of arabia will not sweeten this little
 hand oh oh oh
doctor what a sigh is there the heart is sorely charged
gentlewoman i would not have such a heart in my bosom for the
 dignity of the whole body
doctor well well well
gentlewoman pray god it be sir
doctor this disease is beyond my practise yet i have known
 those which have walked in their sleep who have died
 holily in their beds
lady macbeth wash your hands put on your nightgown look not so
 palei tell you yet again banquo's buried he
 cannot come out on's grave
doctor even so
lady macbeth to bed to bed there's knocking at the gate
 come come come come give me your hand what's
 done cannot be undoneto bed to bed to bed
 exit
doctor will she go now to bed
gentlewoman directly
doctor foul whisperings are abroad unnatural deeds
 do breed unnatural troubles infected minds
 to their deaf pillows will discharge their secrets
 more needs she the divine than the physician
 god god forgive us all look after her
 remove from her the means of all annoyance
 and still keep eyes upon her so good night
 my mind she has mated and amazed my sight
 i think but dare not speak
gentlewoman good night good doctor
