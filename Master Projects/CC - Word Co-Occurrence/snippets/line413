cloten tis all the better
 your valiant britons have their wishes in it
cymbeline lucius hath wrote already to the emperor
 how it goes here it fits us therefore ripely
 our chariots and our horsemen be in readiness
 the powers that he already hath in gallia
 will soon be drawn to head from whence he moves
 his war for britain
queen tis not sleepy business
 but must be look'd to speedily and strongly
cymbeline our expectation that it would be thus
 hath made us forward but my gentle queen
 where is our daughter she hath not appear'd
 before the roman nor to us hath tender'd
 the duty of the day she looks us like
 a thing more made of malice than of duty
 we have noted it call her before us for
 we have been too slight in sufferance
 exit an attendant
queen royal sir
 since the exile of posthumus most retired
 hath her life been the cure whereof my lord
 tis time must do beseech your majesty
 forbear sharp speeches to her she's a lady
 so tender of rebukes that words are strokes
 and strokes death to her
 reenter attendant
cymbeline where is she sir how
 can her contempt be answer'd
attendant please you sir
 her chambers are all lock'd and there's no answer
 that will be given to the loudest noise we make
queen my lord when last i went to visit her
 she pray'd me to excuse her keeping close
 whereto constrain'd by her infirmity
 she should that duty leave unpaid to you
 which daily she was bound to proffer this
 she wish'd me to make known but our great court
 made me to blame in memory
cymbeline her doors lock'd
 not seen of late grant heavens that which i fear
 prove false
 exit
queen son i say follow the king
cloten that man of hers pisanio her old servant
 have not seen these two days
queen go look after
 exit cloten
 pisanio thou that stand'st so for posthumus
 he hath a drug of mine i pray his absence
 proceed by swallowing that for he believes
 it is a thing most precious but for her
 where is she gone haply despair hath seized her
 or wing'd with fervor of her love she's flown
 to her desired posthumus gone she is
 to death or to dishonour and my end
 can make good use of either she being down
 i have the placing of the british crown
 reenter cloten
 how now my son
cloten tis certain she is fled
 go in and cheer the king he rages none
 dare come about him
queen aside all the better may
 this night forestall him of the coming day
 exit
cloten i love and hate her for she's fair and royal
 and that she hath all courtly parts more exquisite
 than lady ladies woman from every one
 the best she hath and she of all compounded
 outsells them all i love her therefore but
 disdaining me and throwing favours on
 the low posthumus slanders so her judgment
 that what's else rare is choked and in that point
 i will conclude to hate her nay indeed
 to be revenged upon her for when fools shall
 enter pisanio
 who is here what are you packing sirrah
 come hither ah you precious pander villain
 where is thy lady in a word or else
 thou art straightway with the fiends
pisanio o good my lord
cloten where is thy lady or by jupiter
 i will not ask again close villain
 i'll have this secret from thy heart or rip
 thy heart to find it is she with posthumus
 from whose so many weights of baseness cannot
 a dram of worth be drawn
pisanio alas my lord
 how can she be with him when was she missed
 he is in rome
cloten where is she sir come nearer
 no further halting satisfy me home
 what is become of her
pisanio o my allworthy lord
cloten allworthy villain
 discover where thy mistress is at once
 at the next word no more of worthy lord'
 speak or thy silence on the instant is
 thy condemnation and thy death
pisanio then sir
 this paper is the history of my knowledge
 touching her flight
 presenting a letter
cloten let's see't i will pursue her
 even to augustus throne
pisanio aside or this or perish
 she's far enough and what he learns by this
 may prove his travel not her danger
cloten hum
pisanio aside i'll write to my lord she's dead o imogen
 safe mayst thou wander safe return again
cloten sirrah is this letter true
pisanio sir as i think
cloten it is posthumus hand i know't sirrah if thou
 wouldst not be a villain but do me true service
 undergo those employments wherein i should have
 cause to use thee with a serious industry that is
 what villany soe'er i bid thee do to perform it
 directly and truly i would think thee an honest
 man thou shouldst neither want my means for thy
 relief nor my voice for thy preferment
pisanio well my good lord
cloten wilt thou serve me for since patiently and
 constantly thou hast stuck to the bare fortune of
 that beggar posthumus thou canst not in the
 course of gratitude but be a diligent follower of
 mine wilt thou serve me

 late master's garments in thy possession

 thing i'll remember't anoneven there thou
 villain posthumus will i kill thee i would these
 garments were come she said upon a timethe
 bitterness of it i now belch from my heartthat she
 held the very garment of posthumus in more respect
 than my noble and natural person together with the
 adornment of my qualities with that suit upon my
 back will i ravish her first kill him and in her
 eyes there shall she see my valour which will then
 be a torment to her contempt he on the ground my
 speech of insultment ended on his dead body and
 when my lust hath dinedwhich as i say to vex
 her i will execute in the clothes that she so
 praisedto the court i'll knock her back foot
 her home again she hath despised me rejoicingly
 and i'll be merry in my revenge
 reenter pisanio with the clothes
 be those the garments
pisanio ay my noble lord
cloten how long is't since she went to milfordhaven
pisanio she can scarce be there yet
cloten bring this apparel to my chamber that is the second
 thing that i have commanded thee the third is
 that thou wilt be a voluntary mute to my design be
 but duteous and true preferment shall tender itself
 to thee my revenge is now at milford would i had
 wings to follow it come and be true
 exit
pisanio thou bid'st me to my loss for true to thee
 were to prove false which i will never be
 to him that is most true to milford go
 and find not her whom thou pursuest flow flow
 you heavenly blessings on her this fool's speed

act iii
scene vi wales before the cave of belarius
 enter imogen in boy's clothes
imogen i see a man's life is a tedious one
 i have tired myself and for two nights together
 have made the ground my bed i should be sick
 but that my resolution helps me milford
 when from the mountaintop pisanio show'd thee
 thou wast within a ken o jove i think
 foundations fly the wretched such i mean
 where they should be relieved two beggars told me
 i could not miss my way will poor folks lie
 that have afflictions on them knowing tis
 a punishment or trial yes no wonder
 when rich ones scarce tell true to lapse in fulness
 is sorer than to lie for need and falsehood
 is worse in kings than beggars my dear lord
 thou art one o the false ones now i think on thee
 my hunger's gone but even before i was
 at point to sink for food but what is this
 here is a path to't tis some savage hold
 i were best not to call i dare not call
 yet famine
 ere clean it o'erthrow nature makes it valiant
 plenty and peace breeds cowards hardness ever
 of hardiness is mother ho who's here
