 no needful thing omitted
pericles pure dian bless thee for thy vision i
 will offer nightoblations to thee thaisa
 this prince the fairbetrothed of your daughter
 shall marry her at pentapolis and now
 this ornament
 makes me look dismal will i clip to form
 and what this fourteen years no razor touch'd
 to grace thy marriageday i'll beautify
thaisa lord cerimon hath letters of good credit sir
 my father's dead
pericles heavens make a star of him yet there my queen
 we'll celebrate their nuptials and ourselves
 will in that kingdom spend our following days
 our son and daughter shall in tyrus reign
 lord cerimon we do our longing stay
 to hear the rest untold sir lead's the way
 exeunt
 enter gower
gower in antiochus and his daughter you have heard
 of monstrous lust the due and just reward
 in pericles his queen and daughter seen
 although assail'd with fortune fierce and keen
 virtue preserved from fell destruction's blast
 led on by heaven and crown'd with joy at last
 in helicanus may you well descry
 a figure of truth of faith of loyalty
 in reverend cerimon there well appears
 the worth that learned charity aye wears
 for wicked cleon and his wife when fame
 had spread their cursed deed and honour'd name
 of pericles to rage the city turn
 that him and his they in his palace burn
 the gods for murder seemed so content
 to punish them although not done but meant
 so on your patience evermore attending
 new joy wait on you here our play has ending

scene i before an alehouse on a heath
 enter hostess and sly
sly i'll pheeze you in faith
hostess a pair of stocks you rogue
sly ye are a baggage the slys are no rogues look in
 the chronicles we came in with richard conqueror
 therefore paucas pallabris let the world slide sessa
hostess you will not pay for the glasses you have burst
sly no not a denier go by jeronimy go to thy cold
 bed and warm thee
hostess i know my remedy i must go fetch the

sly third or fourth or fifth borough i'll answer him
 by law i'll not budge an inch boy let him come
 and kindly
 falls asleep
 horns winded enter a lord from hunting with his train
lord huntsman i charge thee tender well my hounds
 brach merriman the poor cur is emboss'd
 and couple clowder with the deepmouth'd brach
 saw'st thou not boy how silver made it good
 at the hedgecorner in the coldest fault
 i would not lose the dog for twenty pound
first huntsman why belman is as good as he my lord
 he cried upon it at the merest loss
 and twice today pick'd out the dullest scent
 trust me i take him for the better dog
lord thou art a fool if echo were as fleet
 i would esteem him worth a dozen such
 but sup them well and look unto them all
 tomorrow i intend to hunt again
first huntsman i will my lord
lord what's here one dead or drunk see doth he breathe
second huntsman he breathes my lord were he not warm'd with ale
 this were a bed but cold to sleep so soundly
lord o monstrous beast how like a swine he lies
 grim death how foul and loathsome is thine image
 sirs i will practise on this drunken man
 what think you if he were convey'd to bed
 wrapp'd in sweet clothes rings put upon his fingers
 a most delicious banquet by his bed
 and brave attendants near him when he wakes
 would not the beggar then forget himself
first huntsman believe me lord i think he cannot choose
second huntsman it would seem strange unto him when he waked
lord even as a flattering dream or worthless fancy
 then take him up and manage well the jest
 carry him gently to my fairest chamber
 and hang it round with all my wanton pictures
 balm his foul head in warm distilled waters
 and burn sweet wood to make the lodging sweet
 procure me music ready when he wakes
 to make a dulcet and a heavenly sound
 and if he chance to speak be ready straight
 and with a low submissive reverence
 say what is it your honour will command'
 let one attend him with a silver basin
 full of rosewater and bestrew'd with flowers
 another bear the ewer the third a diaper
 and say will't please your lordship cool your hands'
 some one be ready with a costly suit
 and ask him what apparel he will wear
 another tell him of his hounds and horse
 and that his lady mourns at his disease
 persuade him that he hath been lunatic
 and when he says he is say that he dreams
 for he is nothing but a mighty lord
 this do and do it kindly gentle sirs
 it will be pastime passing excellent
 if it be husbanded with modesty
first huntsman my lord i warrant you we will play our part
 as he shall think by our true diligence
 he is no less than what we say he is
lord take him up gently and to bed with him
 and each one to his office when he wakes
 some bear out sly a trumpet sounds
 sirrah go see what trumpet tis that sounds
 exit servingman
 belike some noble gentleman that means
 travelling some journey to repose him here
 reenter servingman
 how now who is it
servant an't please your honour players
 that offer service to your lordship
lord bid them come near
 enter players
 now fellows you are welcome
players we thank your honour
lord do you intend to stay with me tonight
a player so please your lordship to accept our duty
lord with all my heart this fellow i remember
 since once he play'd a farmer's eldest son
 twas where you woo'd the gentlewoman so well
 i have forgot your name but sure that part
 was aptly fitted and naturally perform'd
a player i think twas soto that your honour means
lord tis very true thou didst it excellent
 well you are come to me in a happy time
 the rather for i have some sport in hand
 wherein your cunning can assist me much
 there is a lord will hear you play tonight
 but i am doubtful of your modesties
 lest overeyeing of his odd behavior
 for yet his honour never heard a play
 you break into some merry passion
 and so offend him for i tell you sirs
 if you should smile he grows impatient
