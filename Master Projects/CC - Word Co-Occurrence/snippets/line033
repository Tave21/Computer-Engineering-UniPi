so moab was subdued that day under the hand of israel and the land had rest fourscore years
and after him was shamgar the son of anath which slew of the philistines six hundred men with an ox goad and he also delivered israel
and the children of israel again did evil in the sight of the lord when ehud was dead
and the lord sold them into the hand of jabin king of canaan that reigned in hazor the captain of whose host was sisera which dwelt in harosheth of the gentiles
and the children of israel cried unto the lord for he had nine hundred chariots of iron and twenty years he mightily oppressed the children of israel
and deborah a prophetess the wife of lapidoth she judged israel at that time
and she dwelt under the palm tree of deborah between ramah and bethel in mount ephraim and the children of israel came up to her for judgment
and she sent and called barak the son of abinoam out of kedeshnaphtali and said unto him hath not the lord god of israel commanded saying go and draw toward mount tabor and take with thee ten thousand men of the children of naphtali and of the children of zebulun
and i will draw unto thee to the river kishon sisera the captain of jabin's army with his chariots and his multitude and i will deliver him into thine hand
and barak said unto her if thou wilt go with me then i will go but if thou wilt not go with me then i will not go
and she said i will surely go with thee notwithstanding the journey that thou takest shall not be for thine honour for the lord shall sell sisera into the hand of a woman and deborah arose and went with barak to kedesh
and barak called zebulun and naphtali to kedesh and he went up with ten thousand men at his feet and deborah went up with him
now heber the kenite which was of the children of hobab the father in law of moses had severed himself from the kenites and pitched his tent unto the plain of zaanaim which is by kedesh
and they shewed sisera that barak the son of abinoam was gone up to mount tabor
and sisera gathered together all his chariots even nine hundred chariots of iron and all the people that were with him from harosheth of the gentiles unto the river of kishon
and deborah said unto barak up for this is the day in which the lord hath delivered sisera into thine hand is not the lord gone out before thee so barak went down from mount tabor and ten thousand men after him
and the lord discomfited sisera and all his chariots and all his host with the edge of the sword before barak so that sisera lighted down off his chariot and fled away on his feet
but barak pursued after the chariots and after the host unto harosheth of the gentiles and all the host of sisera fell upon the edge of the sword and there was not a man left
howbeit sisera fled away on his feet to the tent of jael the wife of heber the kenite for there was peace between jabin the king of hazor and the house of heber the kenite
and jael went out to meet sisera and said unto him turn in my lord turn in to me fear not and when he had turned in unto her into the tent she covered him with a mantle
and he said unto her give me i pray thee a little water to drink for i am thirsty and she opened a bottle of milk and gave him drink and covered him
again he said unto her stand in the door of the tent and it shall be when any man doth come and enquire of thee and say is there any man here that thou shalt say no
then jael heber's wife took a nail of the tent and took an hammer in her hand and went softly unto him and smote the nail into his temples and fastened it into the ground for he was fast asleep and weary so he died
and behold as barak pursued sisera jael came out to meet him and said unto him come and i will shew thee the man whom thou seekest and when he came into her tent behold sisera lay dead and the nail was in his temples
so god subdued on that day jabin the king of canaan before the children of israel
and the hand of the children of israel prospered and prevailed against jabin the king of canaan until they had destroyed jabin king of canaan
then sang deborah and barak the son of abinoam on that day saying
praise ye the lord for the avenging of israel when the people willingly offered themselves
hear o ye kings give ear o ye princes i even i will sing unto the lord i will sing praise to the lord god of israel
lord when thou wentest out of seir when thou marchedst out of the field of edom the earth trembled and the heavens dropped the clouds also dropped water
the mountains melted from before the lord even that sinai from before the lord god of israel
in the days of shamgar the son of anath in the days of jael the highways were unoccupied and the travellers walked through byways
the inhabitants of the villages ceased they ceased in israel until that i deborah arose that i arose a mother in israel
they chose new gods then was war in the gates was there a shield or spear seen among forty thousand in israel
my heart is toward the governors of israel that offered themselves willingly among the people bless ye the lord
speak ye that ride on white asses ye that sit in judgment and walk by the way
they that are delivered from the noise of archers in the places of drawing water there shall they rehearse the righteous acts of the lord even the righteous acts toward the inhabitants of his villages in israel then shall the people of the lord go down to the gates
awake awake deborah awake awake utter a song arise barak and lead thy captivity captive thou son of abinoam
then he made him that remaineth have dominion over the nobles among the people the lord made me have dominion over the mighty
out of ephraim was there a root of them against amalek after thee benjamin among thy people out of machir came down governors and out of zebulun they that handle the pen of the writer
and the princes of issachar were with deborah even issachar and also barak he was sent on foot into the valley for the divisions of reuben there were great thoughts of heart
why abodest thou among the sheepfolds to hear the bleatings of the flocks for the divisions of reuben there were great searchings of heart
gilead abode beyond jordan and why did dan remain in ships asher continued on the sea shore and abode in his breaches
zebulun and naphtali were a people that jeoparded their lives unto the death in the high places of the field
the kings came and fought then fought the kings of canaan in taanach by the waters of megiddo they took no gain of money
they fought from heaven the stars in their courses fought against sisera
the river of kishon swept them away that ancient river the river kishon o my soul thou hast trodden down strength
then were the horsehoofs broken by the means of the pransings the pransings of their mighty ones
curse ye meroz said the angel of the lord curse ye bitterly the inhabitants thereof because they came not to the help of the lord to the help of the lord against the mighty
blessed above women shall jael the wife of heber the kenite be blessed shall she be above women in the tent
he asked water and she gave him milk she brought forth butter in a lordly dish
she put her hand to the nail and her right hand to the workmen's hammer and with the hammer she smote sisera she smote off his head when she had pierced and stricken through his temples
at her feet he bowed he fell he lay down at her feet he bowed he fell where he bowed there he fell down dead
the mother of sisera looked out at a window and cried through the lattice why is his chariot so long in coming why tarry the wheels of his chariots
her wise ladies answered her yea she returned answer to herself
have they not sped have they not divided the prey to every man a damsel or two to sisera a prey of divers colours a prey of divers colours of needlework of divers colours of needlework on both sides meet for the necks of them that take the spoil
so let all thine enemies perish o lord but let them that love him be as the sun when he goeth forth in his might and the land had rest forty years
and the children of israel did evil in the sight of the lord and the lord delivered them into the hand of midian seven years
and the hand of midian prevailed against israel and because of the midianites the children of israel made them the dens which are in the mountains and caves and strong holds
and so it was when israel had sown that the midianites came up and the amalekites and the children of the east even they came up against them
and they encamped against them and destroyed the increase of the earth till thou come unto gaza and left no sustenance for israel neither sheep nor ox nor ass
for they came up with their cattle and their tents and they came as grasshoppers for multitude for both they and their camels were without number and they entered into the land to destroy it
and israel was greatly impoverished because of the midianites and the children of israel cried unto the lord
and it came to pass when the children of israel cried unto the lord because of the midianites
that the lord sent a prophet unto the children of israel which said unto them thus saith the lord god of israel i brought you up from egypt and brought you forth out of the house of bondage
and i delivered you out of the hand of the egyptians and out of the hand of all that oppressed you and drave them out from before you and gave you their land
and i said unto you i am the lord your god fear not the gods of the amorites in whose land ye dwell but ye have not obeyed my voice
and there came an angel of the lord and sat under an oak which was in ophrah that pertained unto joash the abiezrite and his son gideon threshed wheat by the winepress to hide it from the midianites
and the angel of the lord appeared unto him and said unto him the lord is with thee thou mighty man of valour
and gideon said unto him oh my lord if the lord be with us why then is all this befallen us and where be all his miracles which our fathers told us of saying did not the lord bring us up from egypt but now the lord hath forsaken us and delivered us into the hands of the midianites
and the lord looked upon him and said go in this thy might and thou shalt save israel from the hand of the midianites have not i sent thee
and he said unto him oh my lord wherewith shall i save israel behold my family is poor in manasseh and i am the least in my father's house
and the lord said unto him surely i will be with thee and thou shalt smite the midianites as one man
and he said unto him if now i have found grace in thy sight then shew me a sign that thou talkest with me
depart not hence i pray thee until i come unto thee and bring forth my present and set it before thee and he said i will tarry until thou come again
and gideon went in and made ready a kid and unleavened cakes of an ephah of flour the flesh he put in a basket and he put the broth in a pot and brought it out unto him under the oak and presented it
and the angel of god said unto him take the flesh and the unleavened cakes and lay them upon this rock and pour out the broth and he did so
then the angel of the lord put forth the end of the staff that was in his hand and touched the flesh and the unleavened cakes and there rose up fire out of the rock and consumed the flesh and the unleavened cakes then the angel of the lord departed out of his sight
and when gideon perceived that he was an angel of the lord gideon said alas o lord god for because i have seen an angel of the lord face to face
and the lord said unto him peace be unto thee fear not thou shalt not die
then gideon built an altar there unto the lord and called it jehovahshalom unto this day it is yet in ophrah of the abiezrites
and it came to pass the same night that the lord said unto him take thy father's young bullock even the second bullock of seven years old and throw down the altar of baal that thy father hath and cut down the grove that is by it
and build an altar unto the lord thy god upon the top of this rock in the ordered place and take the second bullock and offer a burnt sacrifice with the wood of the grove which thou shalt cut down
then gideon took ten men of his servants and did as the lord had said unto him and so it was because he feared his father's household and the men of the city that he could not do it by day that he did it by night
and when the men of the city arose early in the morning behold the altar of baal was cast down and the grove was cut down that was by it and the second bullock was offered upon the altar that was built
and they said one to another who hath done this thing and when they enquired and asked they said gideon the son of joash hath done this thing
then the men of the city said unto joash bring out thy son that he may die because he hath cast down the altar of baal and because he hath cut down the grove that was by it
and joash said unto all that stood against him will ye plead for baal will ye save him he that will plead for him let him be put to death whilst it is yet morning if he be a god let him plead for himself because one hath cast down his altar
therefore on that day he called him jerubbaal saying let baal plead against him because he hath thrown down his altar
then all the midianites and the amalekites and the children of the east were gathered together and went over and pitched in the valley of jezreel
but the spirit of the lord came upon gideon and he blew a trumpet and abiezer was gathered after him
and he sent messengers throughout all manasseh who also was gathered after him and he sent messengers unto asher and unto zebulun and unto naphtali and they came up to meet them
and gideon said unto god if thou wilt save israel by mine hand as thou hast said
behold i will put a fleece of wool in the floor and if the dew be on the fleece only and it be dry upon all the earth beside then shall i know that thou wilt save israel by mine hand as thou hast said
and it was so for he rose up early on the morrow and thrust the fleece together and wringed the dew out of the fleece a bowl full of water
and gideon said unto god let not thine anger be hot against me and i will speak but this once let me prove i pray thee but this once with the fleece let it now be dry only upon the fleece and upon all the ground let there be dew
and god did so that night for it was dry upon the fleece only and there was dew on all the ground
then jerubbaal who is gideon and all the people that were with him rose up early and pitched beside the well of harod so that the host of the midianites were on the north side of them by the hill of moreh in the valley
and the lord said unto gideon the people that are with thee are too many for me to give the midianites into their hands lest israel vaunt themselves against me saying mine own hand hath saved me
now therefore go to proclaim in the ears of the people saying whosoever is fearful and afraid let him return and depart early from mount gilead and there returned of the people twenty and two thousand and there remained ten thousand
and the lord said unto gideon the people are yet too many bring them down unto the water and i will try them for thee there and it shall be that of whom i say unto thee this shall go with thee the same shall go with thee and of whomsoever i say unto thee this shall not go with thee the same shall not go
so he brought down the people unto the water and the lord said unto gideon every one that lappeth of the water with his tongue as a dog lappeth him shalt thou set by himself likewise every one that boweth down upon his knees to drink
and the number of them that lapped putting their hand to their mouth were three hundred men but all the rest of the people bowed down upon their knees to drink water
and the lord said unto gideon by the three hundred men that lapped will i save you and deliver the midianites into thine hand and let all the other people go every man unto his place
so the people took victuals in their hand and their trumpets and he sent all the rest of israel every man unto his tent and retained those three hundred men and the host of midian was beneath him in the valley
and it came to pass the same night that the lord said unto him arise get thee down unto the host for i have delivered it into thine hand
but if thou fear to go down go thou with phurah thy servant down to the host
and thou shalt hear what they say and afterward shall thine hands be strengthened to go down unto the host then went he down with phurah his servant unto the outside of the armed men that were in the host
and the midianites and the amalekites and all the children of the east lay along in the valley like grasshoppers for multitude and their camels were without number as the sand by the sea side for multitude
and when gideon was come behold there was a man that told a dream unto his fellow and said behold i dreamed a dream and lo a cake of barley bread tumbled into the host of midian and came unto a tent and smote it that it fell and overturned it that the tent lay along
and his fellow answered and said this is nothing else save the sword of gideon the son of joash a man of israel for into his hand hath god delivered midian and all the host
and it was so when gideon heard the telling of the dream and the interpretation thereof that he worshipped and returned into the host of israel and said arise for the lord hath delivered into your hand the host of midian
and he divided the three hundred men into three companies and he put a trumpet in every man's hand with empty pitchers and lamps within the pitchers
and he said unto them look on me and do likewise and behold when i come to the outside of the camp it shall be that as i do so shall ye do
when i blow with a trumpet i and all that are with me then blow ye the trumpets also on every side of all the camp and say the sword of the lord and of gideon
so gideon and the hundred men that were with him came unto the outside of the camp in the beginning of the middle watch and they had but newly set the watch and they blew the trumpets and brake the pitchers that were in their hands
and the three companies blew the trumpets and brake the pitchers and held the lamps in their left hands and the trumpets in their right hands to blow withal and they cried the sword of the lord and of gideon
and they stood every man in his place round about the camp and all the host ran and cried and fled
and the three hundred blew the trumpets and the lord set every man's sword against his fellow even throughout all the host and the host fled to bethshittah in zererath and to the border of abelmeholah unto tabbath
and the men of israel gathered themselves together out of naphtali and out of asher and out of all manasseh and pursued after the midianites
and gideon sent messengers throughout all mount ephraim saying come down against the midianites and take before them the waters unto bethbarah and jordan then all the men of ephraim gathered themselves together and took the waters unto bethbarah and jordan
and they took two princes of the midianites oreb and zeeb and they slew oreb upon the rock oreb and zeeb they slew at the winepress of zeeb and pursued midian and brought the heads of oreb and zeeb to gideon on the other side jordan
and the men of ephraim said unto him why hast thou served us thus that thou calledst us not when thou wentest to fight with the midianites and they did chide with him sharply
and he said unto them what have i done now in comparison of you is not the gleaning of the grapes of ephraim better than the vintage of abiezer
god hath delivered into your hands the princes of midian oreb and zeeb and what was i able to do in comparison of you then their anger was abated toward him when he had said that
and gideon came to jordan and passed over he and the three hundred men that were with him faint yet pursuing them
and he said unto the men of succoth give i pray you loaves of bread unto the people that follow me for they be faint and i am pursuing after zebah and zalmunna kings of midian
and the princes of succoth said are the hands of zebah and zalmunna now in thine hand that we should give bread unto thine army
and gideon said therefore when the lord hath delivered zebah and zalmunna into mine hand then i will tear your flesh with the thorns of the wilderness and with briers
and he went up thence to penuel and spake unto them likewise and the men of penuel answered him as the men of succoth had answered him
and he spake also unto the men of penuel saying when i come again in peace i will break down this tower
now zebah and zalmunna were in karkor and their hosts with them about fifteen thousand men all that were left of all the hosts of the children of the east for there fell an hundred and twenty thousand men that drew sword
and gideon went up by the way of them that dwelt in tents on the east of nobah and jogbehah and smote the host for the host was secure
and when zebah and zalmunna fled he pursued after them and took the two kings of midian zebah and zalmunna and discomfited all the host
and gideon the son of joash returned from battle before the sun was up
and caught a young man of the men of succoth and enquired of him and he described unto him the princes of succoth and the elders thereof even threescore and seventeen men
and he came unto the men of succoth and said behold zebah and zalmunna with whom ye did upbraid me saying are the hands of zebah and zalmunna now in thine hand that we should give bread unto thy men that are weary
and he took the elders of the city and thorns of the wilderness and briers and with them he taught the men of succoth
and he beat down the tower of penuel and slew the men of the city
then said he unto zebah and zalmunna what manner of men were they whom ye slew at tabor and they answered as thou art so were they each one resembled the children of a king
and he said they were my brethren even the sons of my mother as the lord liveth if ye had saved them alive i would not slay you
and he said unto jether his firstborn up and slay them but the youth drew not his sword for he feared because he was yet a youth
then zebah and zalmunna said rise thou and fall upon us for as the man is so is his strength and gideon arose and slew zebah and zalmunna and took away the ornaments that were on their camels necks
then the men of israel said unto gideon rule thou over us both thou and thy son and thy son's son also for thou hast delivered us from the hand of midian
and gideon said unto them i will not rule over you neither shall my son rule over you the lord shall rule over you
and gideon said unto them i would desire a request of you that ye would give me every man the earrings of his prey for they had golden earrings because they were ishmaelites
and they answered we will willingly give them and they spread a garment and did cast therein every man the earrings of his prey
and the weight of the golden earrings that he requested was a thousand and seven hundred shekels of gold beside ornaments and collars and purple raiment that was on the kings of midian and beside the chains that were about their camels necks
and gideon made an ephod thereof and put it in his city even in ophrah and all israel went thither a whoring after it which thing became a snare unto gideon and to his house
thus was midian subdued before the children of israel so that they lifted up their heads no more and the country was in quietness forty years in the days of gideon
and jerubbaal the son of joash went and dwelt in his own house
and gideon had threescore and ten sons of his body begotten for he had many wives
and his concubine that was in shechem she also bare him a son whose name he called abimelech
and gideon the son of joash died in a good old age and was buried in the sepulchre of joash his father in ophrah of the abiezrites
and it came to pass as soon as gideon was dead that the children of israel turned again and went a whoring after baalim and made baalberith their god
and the children of israel remembered not the lord their god who had delivered them out of the hands of all their enemies on every side
neither shewed they kindness to the house of jerubbaal namely gideon according to all the goodness which he had shewed unto israel
and abimelech the son of jerubbaal went to shechem unto his mother's brethren and communed with them and with all the family of the house of his mother's father saying
speak i pray you in the ears of all the men of shechem whether is better for you either that all the sons of jerubbaal which are threescore and ten persons reign over you or that one reign over you remember also that i am your bone and your flesh
and his mother's brethren spake of him in the ears of all the men of shechem all these words and their hearts inclined to follow abimelech for they said he is our brother
and they gave him threescore and ten pieces of silver out of the house of baalberith wherewith abimelech hired vain and light persons which followed him
and he went unto his father's house at ophrah and slew his brethren the sons of jerubbaal being threescore and ten persons upon one stone notwithstanding yet jotham the youngest son of jerubbaal was left for he hid himself
and all the men of shechem gathered together and all the house of millo and went and made abimelech king by the plain of the pillar that was in shechem
and when they told it to jotham he went and stood in the top of mount gerizim and lifted up his voice and cried and said unto them hearken unto me ye men of shechem that god may hearken unto you
the trees went forth on a time to anoint a king over them and they said unto the olive tree reign thou over us
but the olive tree said unto them should i leave my fatness wherewith by me they honour god and man and go to be promoted over the trees
and the trees said to the fig tree come thou and reign over us
but the fig tree said unto them should i forsake my sweetness and my good fruit and go to be promoted over the trees
then said the trees unto the vine come thou and reign over us
and the vine said unto them should i leave my wine which cheereth god and man and go to be promoted over the trees
then said all the trees unto the bramble come thou and reign over us
and the bramble said unto the trees if in truth ye anoint me king over you then come and put your trust in my shadow and if not let fire come out of the bramble and devour the cedars of lebanon
now therefore if ye have done truly and sincerely in that ye have made abimelech king and if ye have dealt well with jerubbaal and his house and have done unto him according to the deserving of his hands
for my father fought for you and adventured his life far and delivered you out of the hand of midian
and ye are risen up against my father's house this day and have slain his sons threescore and ten persons upon one stone and have made abimelech the son of his maidservant king over the men of shechem because he is your brother
if ye then have dealt truly and sincerely with jerubbaal and with his house this day then rejoice ye in abimelech and let him also rejoice in you
but if not let fire come out from abimelech and devour the men of shechem and the house of millo and let fire come out from the men of shechem and from the house of millo and devour abimelech
and jotham ran away and fled and went to beer and dwelt there for fear of abimelech his brother
when abimelech had reigned three years over israel
then god sent an evil spirit between abimelech and the men of shechem and the men of shechem dealt treacherously with abimelech
that the cruelty done to the threescore and ten sons of jerubbaal might come and their blood be laid upon abimelech their brother which slew them and upon the men of shechem which aided him in the killing of his brethren
and the men of shechem set liers in wait for him in the top of the mountains and they robbed all that came along that way by them and it was told abimelech
and gaal the son of ebed came with his brethren and went over to shechem and the men of shechem put their confidence in him
and they went out into the fields and gathered their vineyards and trode the grapes and made merry and went into the house of their god and did eat and drink and cursed abimelech
and gaal the son of ebed said who is abimelech and who is shechem that we should serve him is not he the son of jerubbaal and zebul his officer serve the men of hamor the father of shechem for why should we serve him
and would to god this people were under my hand then would i remove abimelech and he said to abimelech increase thine army and come out
and when zebul the ruler of the city heard the words of gaal the son of ebed his anger was kindled
and he sent messengers unto abimelech privily saying behold gaal the son of ebed and his brethren be come to shechem and behold they fortify the city against thee
now therefore up by night thou and the people that is with thee and lie in wait in the field
and it shall be that in the morning as soon as the sun is up thou shalt rise early and set upon the city and behold when he and the people that is with him come out against thee then mayest thou do to them as thou shalt find occasion
and abimelech rose up and all the people that were with him by night and they laid wait against shechem in four companies
and gaal the son of ebed went out and stood in the entering of the gate of the city and abimelech rose up and the people that were with him from lying in wait
and when gaal saw the people he said to zebul behold there come people down from the top of the mountains and zebul said unto him thou seest the shadow of the mountains as if they were men
and gaal spake again and said see there come people down by the middle of the land and another company come along by the plain of meonenim
then said zebul unto him where is now thy mouth wherewith thou saidst who is abimelech that we should serve him is not this the people that thou hast despised go out i pray now and fight with them
and gaal went out before the men of shechem and fought with abimelech
and abimelech chased him and he fled before him and many were overthrown and wounded even unto the entering of the gate
and abimelech dwelt at arumah and zebul thrust out gaal and his brethren that they should not dwell in shechem
and it came to pass on the morrow that the people went out into the field and they told abimelech
and he took the people and divided them into three companies and laid wait in the field and looked and behold the people were come forth out of the city and he rose up against them and smote them
