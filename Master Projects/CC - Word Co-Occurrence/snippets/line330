 bid him farewell commit him to the grave
 do him that kindness and take leave of him
young lucius o grandsire grandsire even with all my heart
 would i were dead so you did live again
 o lord i cannot speak to him for weeping
 my tears will choke me if i ope my mouth
 reenter attendants with aaron
aemilius you sad andronici have done with woes
 give sentence on this execrable wretch
 that hath been breeder of these dire events
lucius set him breastdeep in earth and famish him
 there let him stand and rave and cry for food
 if any one relieves or pities him
 for the offence he dies this is our doom
 some stay to see him fasten'd in the earth
aaron o why should wrath be mute and fury dumb
 i am no baby i that with base prayers
 i should repent the evils i have done
 ten thousand worse than ever yet i did
 would i perform if i might have my will
 if one good deed in all my life i did
 i do repent it from my very soul
lucius some loving friends convey the emperor hence
 and give him burial in his father's grave
 my father and lavinia shall forthwith
 be closed in our household's monument
 as for that heinous tiger tamora
 no funeral rite nor man m mourning weeds
 no mournful bell shall ring her burial
 but throw her forth to beasts and birds of prey
 her life was beastlike and devoid of pity
 and being so shall have like want of pity
 see justice done on aaron that damn'd moor
 by whom our heavy haps had their beginning
 then afterwards to order well the state
 that like events may ne'er it ruinate
 exeunt
 a lover's complaint
from off a hill whose concave womb reworded
a plaintful story from a sistering vale
my spirits to attend this double voice accorded
and down i laid to list the sadtuned tale
ere long espied a fickle maid full pale
tearing of papers breaking rings atwain
storming her world with sorrow's wind and rain
upon her head a platted hive of straw
which fortified her visage from the sun
whereon the thought might think sometime it saw
the carcass of beauty spent and done
time had not scythed all that youth begun
nor youth all quit but spite of heaven's fell rage
some beauty peep'd through lattice of sear'd age
oft did she heave her napkin to her eyne
which on it had conceited characters
laundering the silken figures in the brine
that season'd woe had pelleted in tears
and often reading what contents it bears
as often shrieking undistinguish'd woe
in clamours of all size both high and low
sometimes her levell'd eyes their carriage ride
as they did battery to the spheres intend
sometime diverted their poor balls are tied
to the orbed earth sometimes they do extend
their view right on anon their gazes lend
to every place at once and nowhere fix'd
the mind and sight distractedly commix'd
her hair nor loose nor tied in formal plat
proclaim'd in her a careless hand of pride
for some untuck'd descended her sheaved hat
hanging her pale and pined cheek beside
some in her threaden fillet still did bide
and true to bondage would not break from thence
though slackly braided in loose negligence
a thousand favours from a maund she drew
of amber crystal and of beaded jet
which one by one she in a river threw
upon whose weeping margent she was set
like usury applying wet to wet
or monarch's hands that let not bounty fall
where want cries some but where excess begs all
of folded schedules had she many a one
which she perused sigh'd tore and gave the flood
crack'd many a ring of posied gold and bone
bidding them find their sepulchres in mud
found yet moe letters sadly penn'd in blood
with sleided silk feat and affectedly
enswathed and seal'd to curious secrecy
these often bathed she in her fluxive eyes
and often kiss'd and often gan to tear
cried o false blood thou register of lies
what unapproved witness dost thou bear
ink would have seem'd more black and damned here'
this said in top of rage the lines she rents
big discontent so breaking their contents
a reverend man that grazed his cattle nigh
sometime a blusterer that the ruffle knew
of court of city and had let go by
the swiftest hours observed as they flew
towards this afflicted fancy fastly drew
and privileged by age desires to know
in brief the grounds and motives of her woe
so slides he down upon his grained bat
and comelydistant sits he by her side
when he again desires her being sat
her grievance with his hearing to divide
if that from him there may be aught applied
which may her suffering ecstasy assuage
'tis promised in the charity of age
'father she says though in me you behold
the injury of many a blasting hour
let it not tell your judgment i am old
not age but sorrow over me hath power
i might as yet have been a spreading flower
fresh to myself if i had selfapplied
love to myself and to no love beside
'but woe is me too early i attended
a youthful suitit was to gain my grace
of one by nature's outwards so commended
that maidens eyes stuck over all his face
love lack'd a dwelling and made him her place
and when in his fair parts she did abide
she was new lodged and newly deified
'his browny locks did hang in crooked curls
and every light occasion of the wind
upon his lips their silken parcels hurls
what's sweet to do to do will aptly find
each eye that saw him did enchant the mind
for on his visage was in little drawn
what largeness thinks in paradise was sawn
'small show of man was yet upon his chin
his phoenix down began but to appear
like unshorn velvet on that termless skin
whose bare outbragg'd the web it seem'd to wear
yet show'd his visage by that cost more dear
and nice affections wavering stood in doubt
if best were as it was or best without
'his qualities were beauteous as his form
for maidentongued he was and thereof free
yet if men moved him was he such a storm
as oft twixt may and april is to see
when winds breathe sweet untidy though they be
his rudeness so with his authorized youth
did livery falseness in a pride of truth
'well could he ride and often men would say
'that horse his mettle from his rider takes
proud of subjection noble by the sway
what rounds what bounds what course what stop
he makes'
and controversy hence a question takes
whether the horse by him became his deed
or he his manage by the welldoing steed
'but quickly on this side the verdict went
his real habitude gave life and grace
to appertainings and to ornament
accomplish'd in himself not in his case
all aids themselves made fairer by their place
came for additions yet their purposed trim
pieced not his grace but were all graced by him
'so on the tip of his subduing tongue
all kinds of arguments and question deep
all replication prompt and reason strong
for his advantage still did wake and sleep
to make the weeper laugh the laugher weep
he had the dialect and different skill
catching all passions in his craft of will
'that he did in the general bosom reign
of young of old and sexes both enchanted
to dwell with him in thoughts or to remain
in personal duty following where he haunted
consents bewitch'd ere he desire have granted
and dialogued for him what he would say
ask'd their own wills and made their wills obey
'many there were that did his picture get
to serve their eyes and in it put their mind
like fools that in th imagination set
the goodly objects which abroad they find
of lands and mansions theirs in thought assign'd
and labouring in moe pleasures to bestow them
than the true gouty landlord which doth owe them
'so many have that never touch'd his hand
sweetly supposed them mistress of his heart
my woeful self that did in freedom stand
and was my own feesimple not in part
what with his art in youth and youth in art
threw my affections in his charmed power
reserved the stalk and gave him all my flower
'yet did i not as some my equals did
demand of him nor being desired yielded
finding myself in honour so forbid
with safest distance i mine honour shielded
experience for me many bulwarks builded
of proofs newbleeding which remain'd the foil
of this false jewel and his amorous spoil
'but ah who ever shunn'd by precedent
the destined ill she must herself assay
or forced examples gainst her own content
to put the bypast perils in her way
counsel may stop awhile what will not stay
for when we rage advice is often seen
by blunting us to make our wits more keen
