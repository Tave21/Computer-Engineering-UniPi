warwick poor clifford how i scorn his worthless threats
york will you we show our title to the crown
 if not our swords shall plead it in the field
king henry vi what title hast thou traitor to the crown
 thy father was as thou art duke of york
 thy grandfather roger mortimer earl of march
 i am the son of henry the fifth
 who made the dauphin and the french to stoop
 and seized upon their towns and provinces
warwick talk not of france sith thou hast lost it all
king henry vi the lord protector lost it and not i
 when i was crown'd i was but nine months old
richard you are old enough now and yet methinks you lose
 father tear the crown from the usurper's head
edward sweet father do so set it on your head
montague good brother as thou lovest and honourest arms
 let's fight it out and not stand cavilling thus
richard sound drums and trumpets and the king will fly
york sons peace
king henry vi peace thou and give king henry leave to speak
warwick plantagenet shall speak first hear him lords
 and be you silent and attentive too
 for he that interrupts him shall not live
king henry vi think'st thou that i will leave my kingly throne
 wherein my grandsire and my father sat
 no first shall war unpeople this my realm
 ay and their colours often borne in france
 and now in england to our heart's great sorrow
 shall be my windingsheet why faint you lords
 my title's good and better far than his
warwick prove it henry and thou shalt be king
king henry vi henry the fourth by conquest got the crown
york twas by rebellion against his king
king henry vi aside i know not what to say my title's weak
 tell me may not a king adopt an heir
york what then
king henry vi an if he may then am i lawful king
 for richard in the view of many lords
 resign'd the crown to henry the fourth
 whose heir my father was and i am his
york he rose against him being his sovereign
 and made him to resign his crown perforce
warwick suppose my lords he did it unconstrain'd
 think you twere prejudicial to his crown
exeter no for he could not so resign his crown
 but that the next heir should succeed and reign
king henry vi art thou against us duke of exeter
exeter his is the right and therefore pardon me
york why whisper you my lords and answer not
exeter my conscience tells me he is lawful king
king henry vi aside all will revolt from me and turn to him
northumberland plantagenet for all the claim thou lay'st
 think not that henry shall be so deposed
warwick deposed he shall be in despite of all
northumberland thou art deceived tis not thy southern power
 of essex norfolk suffolk nor of kent
 which makes thee thus presumptuous and proud
 can set the duke up in despite of me
clifford king henry be thy title right or wrong
 lord clifford vows to fight in thy defence
 may that ground gape and swallow me alive
 where i shall kneel to him that slew my father
king henry vi o clifford how thy words revive my heart
york henry of lancaster resign thy crown
 what mutter you or what conspire you lords
warwick do right unto this princely duke of york
 or i will fill the house with armed men
 and over the chair of state where now he sits
 write up his title with usurping blood
 he stamps with his foot and the soldiers show
 themselves
king henry vi my lord of warwick hear me but one word
 let me for this my lifetime reign as king
york confirm the crown to me and to mine heirs
 and thou shalt reign in quiet while thou livest
king henry vi i am content richard plantagenet
 enjoy the kingdom after my decease
clifford what wrong is this unto the prince your son
warwick what good is this to england and himself
westmoreland base fearful and despairing henry
clifford how hast thou injured both thyself and us
westmoreland i cannot stay to hear these articles
northumberland nor i
clifford come cousin let us tell the queen these news
westmoreland farewell fainthearted and degenerate king
 in whose cold blood no spark of honour bides
northumberland be thou a prey unto the house of york
 and die in bands for this unmanly deed
clifford in dreadful war mayst thou be overcome
 or live in peace abandon'd and despised
 exeunt northumberland clifford and westmoreland
warwick turn this way henry and regard them not
exeter they seek revenge and therefore will not yield
king henry vi ah exeter
warwick why should you sigh my lord
king henry vi not for myself lord warwick but my son
 whom i unnaturally shall disinherit
 but be it as it may i here entail
 the crown to thee and to thine heirs for ever
 conditionally that here thou take an oath
 to cease this civil war and whilst i live
 to honour me as thy king and sovereign
 and neither by treason nor hostility
 to seek to put me down and reign thyself
york this oath i willingly take and will perform
warwick long live king henry plantagenet embrace him
king henry vi and long live thou and these thy forward sons
york now york and lancaster are reconciled
exeter accursed be he that seeks to make them foes
 sennet here they come down
york farewell my gracious lord i'll to my castle
warwick and i'll keep london with my soldiers
norfolk and i to norfolk with my followers
montague and i unto the sea from whence i came
 exeunt york edward edmund george richard
 warwick norfolk montague their soldiers and
 attendants
king henry vi and i with grief and sorrow to the court
 enter queen margaret and prince edward
exeter here comes the queen whose looks bewray her anger
 i'll steal away
king henry vi exeter so will i
queen margaret nay go not from me i will follow thee
king henry vi be patient gentle queen and i will stay
queen margaret who can be patient in such extremes
 ah wretched man would i had died a maid
 and never seen thee never borne thee son
 seeing thou hast proved so unnatural a father
 hath he deserved to lose his birthright thus
 hadst thou but loved him half so well as i
 or felt that pain which i did for him once
 or nourish'd him as i did with my blood
 thou wouldst have left thy dearest heartblood there
 rather than have that savage duke thine heir
 and disinherited thine only son
prince edward father you cannot disinherit me
 if you be king why should not i succeed
king henry vi pardon me margaret pardon me sweet son
 the earl of warwick and the duke enforced me
queen margaret enforced thee art thou king and wilt be forced
 i shame to hear thee speak ah timorous wretch
 thou hast undone thyself thy son and me
 and given unto the house of york such head
 as thou shalt reign but by their sufferance
 to entail him and his heirs unto the crown
 what is it but to make thy sepulchre
 and creep into it far before thy time
 warwick is chancellor and the lord of calais
 stern falconbridge commands the narrow seas
 the duke is made protector of the realm
 and yet shalt thou be safe such safety finds
 the trembling lamb environed with wolves
 had i been there which am a silly woman
 the soldiers should have toss'd me on their pikes
 before i would have granted to that act
 but thou preferr'st thy life before thine honour
 and seeing thou dost i here divorce myself
 both from thy table henry and thy bed
 until that act of parliament be repeal'd
 whereby my son is disinherited
 the northern lords that have forsworn thy colours
 will follow mine if once they see them spread
 and spread they shall be to thy foul disgrace
 and utter ruin of the house of york
 thus do i leave thee come son let's away
 our army is ready come we'll after them
king henry vi stay gentle margaret and hear me speak
queen margaret thou hast spoke too much already get thee gone
king henry vi gentle son edward thou wilt stay with me
queen margaret ay to be murder'd by his enemies
prince edward when i return with victory from the field
 i'll see your grace till then i'll follow her
queen margaret come son away we may not linger thus
 exeunt queen margaret and prince edward
king henry vi poor queen how love to me and to her son
 hath made her break out into terms of rage
 revenged may she be on that hateful duke
 whose haughty spirit winged with desire
 will cost my crown and like an empty eagle
 tire on the flesh of me and of my son
 the loss of those three lords torments my heart
 i'll write unto them and entreat them fair
 come cousin you shall be the messenger
exeter and i i hope shall reconcile them all
 exeunt
 3 king henry vi
