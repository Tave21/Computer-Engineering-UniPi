act iii
scene i the wood titania lying asleep
 enter quince snug bottom flute snout and
 starveling
bottom are we all met
quince pat pat and here's a marvellous convenient place
 for our rehearsal this green plot shall be our
 stage this hawthornbrake our tiringhouse and we
 will do it in action as we will do it before the duke
bottom peter quince
quince what sayest thou bully bottom
bottom there are things in this comedy of pyramus and
 thisby that will never please first pyramus must
 draw a sword to kill himself which the ladies
 cannot abide how answer you that
snout by'r lakin a parlous fear
starveling i believe we must leave the killing out when all is done
bottom not a whit i have a device to make all well
 write me a prologue and let the prologue seem to
 say we will do no harm with our swords and that
 pyramus is not killed indeed and for the more
 better assurance tell them that i pyramus am not
 pyramus but bottom the weaver this will put them
 out of fear
quince well we will have such a prologue and it shall be
 written in eight and six
bottom no make it two more let it be written in eight and eight
snout will not the ladies be afeard of the lion
starveling i fear it i promise you
bottom masters you ought to consider with yourselves to
 bring ingod shield usa lion among ladies is a
 most dreadful thing for there is not a more fearful
 wildfowl than your lion living and we ought to
 look to t
snout therefore another prologue must tell he is not a lion
bottom nay you must name his name and half his face must
 be seen through the lion's neck and he himself
 must speak through saying thus or to the same
 defect'ladies'or fairladiesi would wish
 you'or i would request you'or i would
 entreat younot to fear not to tremble my life
 for yours if you think i come hither as a lion it
 were pity of my life no i am no such thing i am a
 man as other men are and there indeed let him name
 his name and tell them plainly he is snug the joiner
quince well it shall be so but there is two hard things
 that is to bring the moonlight into a chamber for
 you know pyramus and thisby meet by moonlight
snout doth the moon shine that night we play our play
bottom a calendar a calendar look in the almanac find
 out moonshine find out moonshine
quince yes it doth shine that night
bottom why then may you leave a casement of the great
 chamber window where we play open and the moon
 may shine in at the casement
quince ay or else one must come in with a bush of thorns
 and a lanthorn and say he comes to disfigure or to
 present the person of moonshine then there is
 another thing we must have a wall in the great
 chamber for pyramus and thisby says the story did
 talk through the chink of a wall
snout you can never bring in a wall what say you bottom
bottom some man or other must present wall and let him
 have some plaster or some loam or some roughcast
 about him to signify wall and let him hold his
 fingers thus and through that cranny shall pyramus
 and thisby whisper
quince if that may be then all is well come sit down
 every mother's son and rehearse your parts
 pyramus you begin when you have spoken your
 speech enter into that brake and so every one
 according to his cue
 enter puck behind
puck what hempen homespuns have we swaggering here
 so near the cradle of the fairy queen
 what a play toward i'll be an auditor
 an actor too perhaps if i see cause
quince speak pyramus thisby stand forth
bottom thisby the flowers of odious savours sweet
quince odours odours
bottom odours savours sweet
 so hath thy breath my dearest thisby dear
 but hark a voice stay thou but here awhile
 and by and by i will to thee appear
 exit
puck a stranger pyramus than e'er played here
 exit
flute must i speak now
quince ay marry must you for you must understand he goes
 but to see a noise that he heard and is to come again
flute most radiant pyramus most lilywhite of hue
 of colour like the red rose on triumphant brier
 most brisky juvenal and eke most lovely jew
 as true as truest horse that yet would never tire
 i'll meet thee pyramus at ninny's tomb
quince ninus tomb man why you must not speak that
 yet that you answer to pyramus you speak all your
 part at once cues and all pyramus enter your cue
 is past it is never tire'
flute oas true as truest horse that yet would
 never tire
 reenter puck and bottom with an ass's head
bottom if i were fair thisby i were only thine
quince o monstrous o strange we are haunted pray
 masters fly masters help
 exeunt quince snug flute snout and starveling
puck i'll follow you i'll lead you about a round
 through bog through bush through brake through brier
 sometime a horse i'll be sometime a hound
 a hog a headless bear sometime a fire
 and neigh and bark and grunt and roar and burn
 like horse hound hog bear fire at every turn
 exit
bottom why do they run away this is a knavery of them to
 make me afeard
 reenter snout
snout o bottom thou art changed what do i see on thee
bottom what do you see you see an asshead of your own do
 you
 exit snout
 reenter quince
quince bless thee bottom bless thee thou art
 translated
 exit
bottom i see their knavery this is to make an ass of me
 to fright me if they could but i will not stir
 from this place do what they can i will walk up
 and down here and i will sing that they shall hear
 i am not afraid
 sings
 the ousel cock so black of hue
 with orangetawny bill
 the throstle with his note so true
 the wren with little quill
titania awaking what angel wakes me from my flowery bed
bottom sings
 the finch the sparrow and the lark
 the plainsong cuckoo gray
 whose note full many a man doth mark
 and dares not answer nay
 for indeed who would set his wit to so foolish
 a bird who would give a bird the lie though he cry
 cuckoo never so
titania i pray thee gentle mortal sing again
 mine ear is much enamour'd of thy note
 so is mine eye enthralled to thy shape
 and thy fair virtue's force perforce doth move me
 on the first view to say to swear i love thee
bottom methinks mistress you should have little reason
 for that and yet to say the truth reason and
 love keep little company together nowadays the
 more the pity that some honest neighbours will not
 make them friends nay i can gleek upon occasion
titania thou art as wise as thou art beautiful
bottom not so neither but if i had wit enough to get out
 of this wood i have enough to serve mine own turn
titania out of this wood do not desire to go
 thou shalt remain here whether thou wilt or no
 i am a spirit of no common rate
 the summer still doth tend upon my state
 and i do love thee therefore go with me
 i'll give thee fairies to attend on thee
 and they shall fetch thee jewels from the deep
 and sing while thou on pressed flowers dost sleep
 and i will purge thy mortal grossness so
 that thou shalt like an airy spirit go
 peaseblossom cobweb moth and mustardseed
 enter peaseblossom cobweb moth and mustardseed
peaseblossom ready
cobweb and i
moth and i
mustardseed and i
all where shall we go
titania be kind and courteous to this gentleman
 hop in his walks and gambol in his eyes
 feed him with apricocks and dewberries
 with purple grapes green figs and mulberries
 the honeybags steal from the humblebees
 and for nighttapers crop their waxen thighs
 and light them at the fiery glowworm's eyes
 to have my love to bed and to arise
 and pluck the wings from painted butterflies
 to fan the moonbeams from his sleeping eyes
 nod to him elves and do him courtesies
