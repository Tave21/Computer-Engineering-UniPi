second lord and keep your mind till you return to us
 peaceful and comfortable
helicanus peace peace and give experience tongue
 they do abuse the king that flatter him
 for flattery is the bellows blows up sin
 the thing which is flatter'd but a spark
 to which that blast gives heat and stronger glowing
 whereas reproof obedient and in order
 fits kings as they are men for they may err
 when signior sooth here does proclaim a peace
 he flatters you makes war upon your life
 prince pardon me or strike me if you please
 i cannot be much lower than my knees
pericles all leave us else but let your cares o'erlook
 what shipping and what lading's in our haven
 and then return to us
 exeunt lords
 helicanus thou
 hast moved us what seest thou in our looks
helicanus an angry brow dread lord
pericles if there be such a dart in princes frowns
 how durst thy tongue move anger to our face
helicanus how dare the plants look up to heaven from whence
 they have their nourishment
pericles thou know'st i have power
 to take thy life from thee
helicanus kneeling
 i have ground the axe myself
 do you but strike the blow
pericles rise prithee rise
 sit down thou art no flatterer
 i thank thee for it and heaven forbid
 that kings should let their ears hear their
 faults hid
 fit counsellor and servant for a prince
 who by thy wisdom makest a prince thy servant
 what wouldst thou have me do
helicanus to bear with patience
 such griefs as you yourself do lay upon yourself
pericles thou speak'st like a physician helicanus
 that minister'st a potion unto me
 that thou wouldst tremble to receive thyself
 attend me then i went to antioch
 where as thou know'st against the face of death
 i sought the purchase of a glorious beauty
 from whence an issue i might propagate
 are arms to princes and bring joys to subjects
 her face was to mine eye beyond all wonder
 the resthark in thine earas black as incest
 which by my knowledge found the sinful father
 seem'd not to strike but smooth but thou
 know'st this
 tis time to fear when tyrants seem to kiss
 such fear so grew in me i hither fled
 under the covering of a careful night
 who seem'd my good protector and being here
 bethought me what was past what might succeed
 i knew him tyrannous and tyrants fears
 decrease not but grow faster than the years
 and should he doubt it as no doubt he doth
 that i should open to the listening air
 how many worthy princes bloods were shed
 to keep his bed of blackness unlaid ope
 to lop that doubt he'll fill this land with arms
 and make pretence of wrong that i have done him
 when all for mine if i may call offence
 must feel war's blow who spares not innocence
 which love to all of which thyself art one
 who now reprovest me for it
helicanus alas sir
pericles drew sleep out of mine eyes blood from my cheeks
 musings into my mind with thousand doubts
 how i might stop this tempest ere it came
 and finding little comfort to relieve them
 i thought it princely charity to grieve them
helicanus well my lord since you have given me leave to speak
 freely will i speak antiochus you fear
 and justly too i think you fear the tyrant
 who either by public war or private treason
 will take away your life
 therefore my lord go travel for a while
 till that his rage and anger be forgot
 or till the destinies do cut his thread of life
 your rule direct to any if to me
 day serves not light more faithful than i'll be
pericles i do not doubt thy faith
 but should he wrong my liberties in my absence
helicanus we'll mingle our bloods together in the earth
 from whence we had our being and our birth
pericles tyre i now look from thee then and to tarsus
 intend my travel where i'll hear from thee
 and by whose letters i'll dispose myself
 the care i had and have of subjects good
 on thee i lay whose wisdom's strength can bear it
 i'll take thy word for faith not ask thine oath
 who shuns not to break one will sure crack both
 but in our orbs we'll live so round and safe
 that time of both this truth shall ne'er convince
 thou show'dst a subject's shine i a true prince

 pericles prince of tyre
act i
scene iii tyre an antechamber in the palace
 enter thaliard
thaliard so this is tyre and this the court here must i
 kill king pericles and if i do it not i am sure to
 be hanged at home tis dangerous well i perceive
 he was a wise fellow and had good discretion that
 being bid to ask what he would of the king desired
 he might know none of his secrets now do i see he
 had some reason for't for if a king bid a man be a
 villain he's bound by the indenture of his oath to
 be one hush here come the lords of tyre
 enter helicanus and escanes with other lords of tyre
helicanus you shall not need my fellow peers of tyre
 further to question me of your king's departure
 his seal'd commission left in trust with me
 doth speak sufficiently he's gone to travel
thaliard aside how the king gone
helicanus if further yet you will be satisfied
 why as it were unlicensed of your loves
 he would depart i'll give some light unto you
 being at antioch
thaliard aside what from antioch
helicanus royal antiochuson what cause i know not
 took some displeasure at him at least he judged so
 and doubting lest that he had err'd or sinn'd
 to show his sorrow he'ld correct himself
 so puts himself unto the shipman's toil
 with whom each minute threatens life or death
thaliard aside well i perceive
 i shall not be hang'd now although i would
 but since he's gone the king's seas must please
 he scaped the land to perish at the sea
 i'll present myself peace to the lords of tyre
helicanus lord thaliard from antiochus is welcome
thaliard from him i come
 with message unto princely pericles
 but since my landing i have understood
 your lord has betook himself to unknown travels
 my message must return from whence it came
helicanus we have no reason to desire it
 commended to our master not to us
 yet ere you shall depart this we desire
 as friends to antioch we may feast in tyre
 exeunt
 pericles prince of tyre
act i
scene iv tarsus a room in the governor's house
 enter cleon the governor of tarsus with dionyza
 and others
cleon my dionyza shall we rest us here
 and by relating tales of others griefs
 see if twill teach us to forget our own
dionyza that were to blow at fire in hope to quench it
 for who digs hills because they do aspire
 throws down one mountain to cast up a higher
 o my distressed lord even such our griefs are
 here they're but felt and seen with mischief's eyes
 but like to groves being topp'd they higher rise
cleon o dionyza
 who wanteth food and will not say he wants it
 or can conceal his hunger till he famish
 our tongues and sorrows do sound deep
 our woes into the air our eyes do weep
 till tongues fetch breath that may proclaim them louder
 that if heaven slumber while their creatures want
 they may awake their helps to comfort them
 i'll then discourse our woes felt several years
 and wanting breath to speak help me with tears
dionyza i'll do my best sir
cleon this tarsus o'er which i have the government
 a city on whom plenty held full hand
 for riches strew'd herself even in the streets
 whose towers bore heads so high they kiss'd the clouds
 and strangers ne'er beheld but wondered at
 whose men and dames so jetted and adorn'd
 like one another's glass to trim them by
 their tables were stored full to glad the sight
 and not so much to feed on as delight
 all poverty was scorn'd and pride so great
 the name of help grew odious to repeat
dionyza o tis too true
cleon but see what heaven can do by this our change
 these mouths who but of late earth sea and air
 were all too little to content and please
 although they gave their creatures in abundance
 as houses are defiled for want of use
 they are now starved for want of exercise
 those palates who not yet two summers younger
 must have inventions to delight the taste
 would now be glad of bread and beg for it
 those mothers who to nousle up their babes
 thought nought too curious are ready now
 to eat those little darlings whom they loved
 so sharp are hunger's teeth that man and wife
 draw lots who first shall die to lengthen life
 here stands a lord and there a lady weeping
 here many sink yet those which see them fall
 have scarce strength left to give them burial
