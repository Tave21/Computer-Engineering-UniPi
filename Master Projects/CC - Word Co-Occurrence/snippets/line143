1cor1031 whether therefore ye eat or drink or whatsoever ye do do all to the glory of god
1cor1032 give none offence neither to the jews nor to the gentiles nor to the church of god
1cor1033 even as i please all men in all things not seeking mine own profit but the profit of many that they may be saved
1cor111 be ye followers of me even as i also am of christ
1cor112 now i praise you brethren that ye remember me in all things and keep the ordinances as i delivered them to you
1cor113 but i would have you know that the head of every man is christ and the head of the woman is the man and the head of christ is god
1cor114 every man praying or prophesying having his head covered dishonoureth his head
1cor115 but every woman that prayeth or prophesieth with her head uncovered dishonoureth her head for that is even all one as if she were shaven
1cor116 for if the woman be not covered let her also be shorn but if it be a shame for a woman to be shorn or shaven let her be covered
1cor117 for a man indeed ought not to cover his head forasmuch as he is the image and glory of god but the woman is the glory of the man
1cor118 for the man is not of the woman but the woman of the man
1cor119 neither was the man created for the woman but the woman for the man
1cor1110 for this cause ought the woman to have power on her head because of the angels
1cor1111 nevertheless neither is the man without the woman neither the woman without the man in the lord
1cor1112 for as the woman is of the man even so is the man also by the woman but all things of god
1cor1113 judge in yourselves is it comely that a woman pray unto god uncovered
1cor1114 doth not even nature itself teach you that if a man have long hair it is a shame unto him
1cor1115 but if a woman have long hair it is a glory to her for her hair is given her for a covering
1cor1116 but if any man seem to be contentious we have no such custom neither the churches of god
1cor1117 now in this that i declare unto you i praise you not that ye come together not for the better but for the worse
1cor1118 for first of all when ye come together in the church i hear that there be divisions among you and i partly believe it
1cor1119 for there must be also heresies among you that they which are approved may be made manifest among you
1cor1120 when ye come together therefore into one place this is not to eat the lord's supper
1cor1121 for in eating every one taketh before other his own supper and one is hungry and another is drunken
1cor1122 what have ye not houses to eat and to drink in or despise ye the church of god and shame them that have not what shall i say to you shall i praise you in this i praise you not
1cor1123 for i have received of the lord that which also i delivered unto you that the lord jesus the same night in which he was betrayed took bread
1cor1124 and when he had given thanks he brake it and said take eat this is my body which is broken for you this do in remembrance of me
1cor1125 after the same manner also he took the cup when he had supped saying this cup is the new testament in my blood this do ye as oft as ye drink it in remembrance of me
1cor1126 for as often as ye eat this bread and drink this cup ye do shew the lord's death till he come
1cor1127 wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread and drink this cup of the lord unworthily shall be guilty of the body and blood of the lord
1cor1128 but let a man examine himself and so let him eat of that bread and drink of that cup
1cor1129 for he that eateth and drinketh unworthily eateth and drinketh damnation to himself not discerning the lord's body
1cor1130 for this cause many are weak and sickly among you and many sleep
1cor1131 for if we would judge ourselves we should not be judged
1cor1132 but when we are judged we are chastened of the lord that we should not be condemned with the world
1cor1133 wherefore my brethren when ye come together to eat tarry one for another
1cor1134 and if any man hunger let him eat at home that ye come not together unto condemnation and the rest will i set in order when i come
1cor121 now concerning spiritual gifts brethren i would not have you ignorant
1cor122 ye know that ye were gentiles carried away unto these dumb idols even as ye were led
1cor123 wherefore i give you to understand that no man speaking by the spirit of god calleth jesus accursed and that no man can say that jesus is the lord but by the holy ghost
1cor124 now there are diversities of gifts but the same spirit
1cor125 and there are differences of administrations but the same lord
1cor126 and there are diversities of operations but it is the same god which worketh all in all
1cor127 but the manifestation of the spirit is given to every man to profit withal
1cor128 for to one is given by the spirit the word of wisdom to another the word of knowledge by the same spirit
1cor129 to another faith by the same spirit to another the gifts of healing by the same spirit
1cor1210 to another the working of miracles to another prophecy to another discerning of spirits to another divers kinds of tongues to another the interpretation of tongues
1cor1211 but all these worketh that one and the selfsame spirit dividing to every man severally as he will
1cor1212 for as the body is one and hath many members and all the members of that one body being many are one body so also is christ
1cor1213 for by one spirit are we all baptized into one body whether we be jews or gentiles whether we be bond or free and have been all made to drink into one spirit
1cor1214 for the body is not one member but many
1cor1215 if the foot shall say because i am not the hand i am not of the body is it therefore not of the body
1cor1216 and if the ear shall say because i am not the eye i am not of the body is it therefore not of the body
1cor1217 if the whole body were an eye where were the hearing if the whole were hearing where were the smelling
1cor1218 but now hath god set the members every one of them in the body as it hath pleased him
1cor1219 and if they were all one member where were the body
1cor1220 but now are they many members yet but one body
1cor1221 and the eye cannot say unto the hand i have no need of thee nor again the head to the feet i have no need of you
1cor1222 nay much more those members of the body which seem to be more feeble are necessary
1cor1223 and those members of the body which we think to be less honourable upon these we bestow more abundant honour and our uncomely parts have more abundant comeliness
1cor1224 for our comely parts have no need but god hath tempered the body together having given more abundant honour to that part which lacked
1cor1225 that there should be no schism in the body but that the members should have the same care one for another
1cor1226 and whether one member suffer all the members suffer with it or one member be honoured all the members rejoice with it
1cor1227 now ye are the body of christ and members in particular
1cor1228 and god hath set some in the church first apostles secondarily prophets thirdly teachers after that miracles then gifts of healings helps governments diversities of tongues
1cor1229 are all apostles are all prophets are all teachers are all workers of miracles
1cor1230 have all the gifts of healing do all speak with tongues do all interpret
1cor1231 but covet earnestly the best gifts and yet shew i unto you a more excellent way
1cor131 though i speak with the tongues of men and of angels and have not charity i am become as sounding brass or a tinkling cymbal
1cor132 and though i have the gift of prophecy and understand all mysteries and all knowledge and though i have all faith so that i could remove mountains and have not charity i am nothing
1cor133 and though i bestow all my goods to feed the poor and though i give my body to be burned and have not charity it profiteth me nothing
1cor134 charity suffereth long and is kind charity envieth not charity vaunteth not itself is not puffed up
1cor135 doth not behave itself unseemly seeketh not her own is not easily provoked thinketh no evil
1cor136 rejoiceth not in iniquity but rejoiceth in the truth
1cor137 beareth all things believeth all things hopeth all things endureth all things
1cor138 charity never faileth but whether there be prophecies they shall fail whether there be tongues they shall cease whether there be knowledge it shall vanish away
1cor139 for we know in part and we prophesy in part
1cor1310 but when that which is perfect is come then that which is in part shall be done away
1cor1311 when i was a child i spake as a child i understood as a child i thought as a child but when i became a man i put away childish things
1cor1312 for now we see through a glass darkly but then face to face now i know in part but then shall i know even as also i am known
1cor1313 and now abideth faith hope charity these three but the greatest of these is charity
1cor141 follow after charity and desire spiritual gifts but rather that ye may prophesy
1cor142 for he that speaketh in an unknown tongue speaketh not unto men but unto god for no man understandeth him howbeit in the spirit he speaketh mysteries
1cor143 but he that prophesieth speaketh unto men to edification and exhortation and comfort
1cor144 he that speaketh in an unknown tongue edifieth himself but he that prophesieth edifieth the church
1cor145 i would that ye all spake with tongues but rather that ye prophesied for greater is he that prophesieth than he that speaketh with tongues except he interpret that the church may receive edifying
1cor146 now brethren if i come unto you speaking with tongues what shall i profit you except i shall speak to you either by revelation or by knowledge or by prophesying or by doctrine
1cor147 and even things without life giving sound whether pipe or harp except they give a distinction in the sounds how shall it be known what is piped or harped
1cor148 for if the trumpet give an uncertain sound who shall prepare himself to the battle
1cor149 so likewise ye except ye utter by the tongue words easy to be understood how shall it be known what is spoken for ye shall speak into the air
1cor1410 there are it may be so many kinds of voices in the world and none of them is without signification
1cor1411 therefore if i know not the meaning of the voice i shall be unto him that speaketh a barbarian and he that speaketh shall be a barbarian unto me
1cor1412 even so ye forasmuch as ye are zealous of spiritual gifts seek that ye may excel to the edifying of the church
1cor1413 wherefore let him that speaketh in an unknown tongue pray that he may interpret
1cor1414 for if i pray in an unknown tongue my spirit prayeth but my understanding is unfruitful
1cor1415 what is it then i will pray with the spirit and i will pray with the understanding also i will sing with the spirit and i will sing with the understanding also
1cor1416 else when thou shalt bless with the spirit how shall he that occupieth the room of the unlearned say amen at thy giving of thanks seeing he understandeth not what thou sayest
1cor1417 for thou verily givest thanks well but the other is not edified
1cor1418 i thank my god i speak with tongues more than ye all
1cor1419 yet in the church i had rather speak five words with my understanding that by my voice i might teach others also than ten thousand words in an unknown tongue
1cor1420 brethren be not children in understanding howbeit in malice be ye children but in understanding be men
1cor1421 in the law it is written with men of other tongues and other lips will i speak unto this people and yet for all that will they not hear me saith the lord
1cor1422 wherefore tongues are for a sign not to them that believe but to them that believe not but prophesying serveth not for them that believe not but for them which believe
1cor1423 if therefore the whole church be come together into one place and all speak with tongues and there come in those that are unlearned or unbelievers will they not say that ye are mad
1cor1424 but if all prophesy and there come in one that believeth not or one unlearned he is convinced of all he is judged of all
1cor1425 and thus are the secrets of his heart made manifest and so falling down on his face he will worship god and report that god is in you of a truth
1cor1426 how is it then brethren when ye come together every one of you hath a psalm hath a doctrine hath a tongue hath a revelation hath an interpretation let all things be done unto edifying
1cor1427 if any man speak in an unknown tongue let it be by two or at the most by three and that by course and let one interpret
1cor1428 but if there be no interpreter let him keep silence in the church and let him speak to himself and to god
1cor1429 let the prophets speak two or three and let the other judge
1cor1430 if any thing be revealed to another that sitteth by let the first hold his peace
1cor1431 for ye may all prophesy one by one that all may learn and all may be comforted
1cor1432 and the spirits of the prophets are subject to the prophets
1cor1433 for god is not the author of confusion but of peace as in all churches of the saints
1cor1434 let your women keep silence in the churches for it is not permitted unto them to speak but they are commanded to be under obedience as also saith the law
1cor1435 and if they will learn any thing let them ask their husbands at home for it is a shame for women to speak in the church
1cor1436 what came the word of god out from you or came it unto you only
1cor1437 if any man think himself to be a prophet or spiritual let him acknowledge that the things that i write unto you are the commandments of the lord
1cor1438 but if any man be ignorant let him be ignorant
1cor1439 wherefore brethren covet to prophesy and forbid not to speak with tongues
1cor1440 let all things be done decently and in order
1cor151 moreover brethren i declare unto you the gospel which i preached unto you which also ye have received and wherein ye stand
1cor152 by which also ye are saved if ye keep in memory what i preached unto you unless ye have believed in vain
1cor153 for i delivered unto you first of all that which i also received how that christ died for our sins according to the scriptures
1cor154 and that he was buried and that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures
1cor155 and that he was seen of cephas then of the twelve
1cor156 after that he was seen of above five hundred brethren at once of whom the greater part remain unto this present but some are fallen asleep
1cor157 after that he was seen of james then of all the apostles
1cor158 and last of all he was seen of me also as of one born out of due time
1cor159 for i am the least of the apostles that am not meet to be called an apostle because i persecuted the church of god
1cor1510 but by the grace of god i am what i am and his grace which was bestowed upon me was not in vain but i laboured more abundantly than they all yet not i but the grace of god which was with me
1cor1511 therefore whether it were i or they so we preach and so ye believed
1cor1512 now if christ be preached that he rose from the dead how say some among you that there is no resurrection of the dead
1cor1513 but if there be no resurrection of the dead then is christ not risen
1cor1514 and if christ be not risen then is our preaching vain and your faith is also vain
1cor1515 yea and we are found false witnesses of god because we have testified of god that he raised up christ whom he raised not up if so be that the dead rise not
1cor1516 for if the dead rise not then is not christ raised
1cor1517 and if christ be not raised your faith is vain ye are yet in your sins
1cor1518 then they also which are fallen asleep in christ are perished
1cor1519 if in this life only we have hope in christ we are of all men most miserable
1cor1520 but now is christ risen from the dead and become the firstfruits of them that slept
1cor1521 for since by man came death by man came also the resurrection of the dead
1cor1522 for as in adam all die even so in christ shall all be made alive
1cor1523 but every man in his own order christ the firstfruits afterward they that are christ's at his coming
1cor1524 then cometh the end when he shall have delivered up the kingdom to god even the father when he shall have put down all rule and all authority and power
1cor1525 for he must reign till he hath put all enemies under his feet
1cor1526 the last enemy that shall be destroyed is death
1cor1527 for he hath put all things under his feet but when he saith all things are put under him it is manifest that he is excepted which did put all things under him
1cor1528 and when all things shall be subdued unto him then shall the son also himself be subject unto him that put all things under him that god may be all in all
1cor1529 else what shall they do which are baptized for the dead if the dead rise not at all why are they then baptized for the dead
1cor1530 and why stand we in jeopardy every hour
1cor1531 i protest by your rejoicing which i have in christ jesus our lord i die daily
1cor1532 if after the manner of men i have fought with beasts at ephesus what advantageth it me if the dead rise not let us eat and drink for to morrow we die
1cor1533 be not deceived evil communications corrupt good manners
1cor1534 awake to righteousness and sin not for some have not the knowledge of god i speak this to your shame
1cor1535 but some man will say how are the dead raised up and with what body do they come
1cor1536 thou fool that which thou sowest is not quickened except it die
1cor1537 and that which thou sowest thou sowest not that body that shall be but bare grain it may chance of wheat or of some other grain
1cor1538 but god giveth it a body as it hath pleased him and to every seed his own body
1cor1539 all flesh is not the same flesh but there is one kind of flesh of men another flesh of beasts another of fishes and another of birds
1cor1540 there are also celestial bodies and bodies terrestrial but the glory of the celestial is one and the glory of the terrestrial is another
1cor1541 there is one glory of the sun and another glory of the moon and another glory of the stars for one star differeth from another star in glory
1cor1542 so also is the resurrection of the dead it is sown in corruption it is raised in incorruption
1cor1543 it is sown in dishonour it is raised in glory it is sown in weakness it is raised in power
1cor1544 it is sown a natural body it is raised a spiritual body there is a natural body and there is a spiritual body
1cor1545 and so it is written the first man adam was made a living soul the last adam was made a quickening spirit
1cor1546 howbeit that was not first which is spiritual but that which is natural and afterward that which is spiritual
1cor1547 the first man is of the earth earthy the second man is the lord from heaven
1cor1548 as is the earthy such are they also that are earthy and as is the heavenly such are they also that are heavenly
1cor1549 and as we have borne the image of the earthy we shall also bear the image of the heavenly
1cor1550 now this i say brethren that flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of god neither doth corruption inherit incorruption
1cor1551 behold i shew you a mystery we shall not all sleep but we shall all be changed
1cor1552 in a moment in the twinkling of an eye at the last trump for the trumpet shall sound and the dead shall be raised incorruptible and we shall be changed
1cor1553 for this corruptible must put on incorruption and this mortal must put on immortality
1cor1554 so when this corruptible shall have put on incorruption and this mortal shall have put on immortality then shall be brought to pass the saying that is written death is swallowed up in victory
1cor1555 o death where is thy sting o grave where is thy victory
1cor1556 the sting of death is sin and the strength of sin is the law
1cor1557 but thanks be to god which giveth us the victory through our lord jesus christ
1cor1558 therefore my beloved brethren be ye stedfast unmoveable always abounding in the work of the lord forasmuch as ye know that your labour is not in vain in the lord
1cor161 now concerning the collection for the saints as i have given order to the churches of galatia even so do ye
1cor162 upon the first day of the week let every one of you lay by him in store as god hath prospered him that there be no gatherings when i come
1cor163 and when i come whomsoever ye shall approve by your letters them will i send to bring your liberality unto jerusalem
1cor164 and if it be meet that i go also they shall go with me
1cor165 now i will come unto you when i shall pass through macedonia for i do pass through macedonia
1cor166 and it may be that i will abide yea and winter with you that ye may bring me on my journey whithersoever i go
1cor167 for i will not see you now by the way but i trust to tarry a while with you if the lord permit
1cor168 but i will tarry at ephesus until pentecost
1cor169 for a great door and effectual is opened unto me and there are many adversaries
1cor1610 now if timotheus come see that he may be with you without fear for he worketh the work of the lord as i also do
1cor1611 let no man therefore despise him but conduct him forth in peace that he may come unto me for i look for him with the brethren
1cor1612 as touching our brother apollos i greatly desired him to come unto you with the brethren but his will was not at all to come at this time but he will come when he shall have convenient time
1cor1613 watch ye stand fast in the faith quit you like men be strong
1cor1614 let all your things be done with charity
1cor1615 i beseech you brethren ye know the house of stephanas that it is the firstfruits of achaia and that they have addicted themselves to the ministry of the saints
1cor1616 that ye submit yourselves unto such and to every one that helpeth with us and laboureth
1cor1617 i am glad of the coming of stephanas and fortunatus and achaicus for that which was lacking on your part they have supplied
1cor1618 for they have refreshed my spirit and yours therefore acknowledge ye them that are such
1cor1619 the churches of asia salute you aquila and priscilla salute you much in the lord with the church that is in their house
1cor1620 all the brethren greet you greet ye one another with an holy kiss
1cor1621 the salutation of me paul with mine own hand
