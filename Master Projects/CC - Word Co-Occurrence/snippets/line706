 were and i by him at all adventures so we were quit here
king henry v by my troth i will speak my conscience of the king
 i think he would not wish himself any where but
 where he is
bates then i would he were here alone so should he be
 sure to be ransomed and a many poor men's lives saved
king henry v i dare say you love him not so ill to wish him here
 alone howsoever you speak this to feel other men's
 minds methinks i could not die any where so
 contented as in the king's company his cause being
 just and his quarrel honourable
williams that's more than we know
bates ay or more than we should seek after for we know
 enough if we know we are the kings subjects if
 his cause be wrong our obedience to the king wipes
 the crime of it out of us
williams but if the cause be not good the king himself hath
 a heavy reckoning to make when all those legs and
 arms and heads chopped off in battle shall join
 together at the latter day and cry all we died at
 such a place some swearing some crying for a
 surgeon some upon their wives left poor behind
 them some upon the debts they owe some upon their
 children rawly left i am afeard there are few die
 well that die in a battle for how can they
 charitably dispose of any thing when blood is their
 argument now if these men do not die well it
 will be a black matter for the king that led them to
 it whom to disobey were against all proportion of
 subjection
king henry v so if a son that is by his father sent about
 merchandise do sinfully miscarry upon the sea the
 imputation of his wickedness by your rule should be
 imposed upon his father that sent him or if a
 servant under his master's command transporting a
 sum of money be assailed by robbers and die in
 many irreconciled iniquities you may call the
 business of the master the author of the servant's
 damnation but this is not so the king is not
 bound to answer the particular endings of his
 soldiers the father of his son nor the master of
 his servant for they purpose not their death when
 they purpose their services besides there is no
 king be his cause never so spotless if it come to
 the arbitrement of swords can try it out with all
 unspotted soldiers some peradventure have on them
 the guilt of premeditated and contrived murder
 some of beguiling virgins with the broken seals of
 perjury some making the wars their bulwark that
 have before gored the gentle bosom of peace with
 pillage and robbery now if these men have
 defeated the law and outrun native punishment
 though they can outstrip men they have no wings to
 fly from god war is his beadle war is vengeance
 so that here men are punished for beforebreach of
 the king's laws in now the king's quarrel where
 they feared the death they have borne life away
 and where they would be safe they perish then if
 they die unprovided no more is the king guilty of
 their damnation than he was before guilty of those
 impieties for the which they are now visited every
 subject's duty is the king's but every subject's
 soul is his own therefore should every soldier in
 the wars do as every sick man in his bed wash every
 mote out of his conscience and dying so death
 is to him advantage or not dying the time was
 blessedly lost wherein such preparation was gained
 and in him that escapes it were not sin to think
 that making god so free an offer he let him
 outlive that day to see his greatness and to teach
 others how they should prepare
williams tis certain every man that dies ill the ill upon
 his own head the king is not to answer it
bates but i do not desire he should answer for me and
 yet i determine to fight lustily for him
king henry v i myself heard the king say he would not be ransomed
williams ay he said so to make us fight cheerfully but
 when our throats are cut he may be ransomed and we
 ne'er the wiser
king henry v if i live to see it i will never trust his word after
williams you pay him then that's a perilous shot out of an
 eldergun that a poor and private displeasure can
 do against a monarch you may as well go about to
 turn the sun to ice with fanning in his face with a
 peacock's feather you'll never trust his word
 after come tis a foolish saying
king henry v your reproof is something too round i should be
 angry with you if the time were convenient
williams let it be a quarrel between us if you live
king henry v i embrace it
williams how shall i know thee again
king henry v give me any gage of thine and i will wear it in my
 bonnet then if ever thou darest acknowledge it i
 will make it my quarrel
williams here's my glove give me another of thine
king henry v there
williams this will i also wear in my cap if ever thou come
 to me and say after tomorrow this is my glove'
 by this hand i will take thee a box on the ear
king henry v if ever i live to see it i will challenge it
williams thou darest as well be hanged
king henry v well i will do it though i take thee in the
 king's company
williams keep thy word fare thee well
bates be friends you english fools be friends we have
 french quarrels enow if you could tell how to reckon
king henry v indeed the french may lay twenty french crowns to
 one they will beat us for they bear them on their
 shoulders but it is no english treason to cut
 french crowns and tomorrow the king himself will
 be a clipper
 exeunt soldiers
 upon the king let us our lives our souls
 our debts our careful wives
 our children and our sins lay on the king
 we must bear all o hard condition
 twinborn with greatness subject to the breath
 of every fool whose sense no more can feel
 but his own wringing what infinite heart'sease
 must kings neglect that private men enjoy
 and what have kings that privates have not too
 save ceremony save general ceremony
 and what art thou thou idle ceremony
 what kind of god art thou that suffer'st more
 of mortal griefs than do thy worshippers
 what are thy rents what are thy comings in
 o ceremony show me but thy worth
 what is thy soul of adoration
 art thou aught else but place degree and form
 creating awe and fear in other men
 wherein thou art less happy being fear'd
 than they in fearing
 what drink'st thou oft instead of homage sweet
 but poison'd flattery o be sick great greatness
 and bid thy ceremony give thee cure
 think'st thou the fiery fever will go out
 with titles blown from adulation
 will it give place to flexure and low bending
 canst thou when thou command'st the beggar's knee
 command the health of it no thou proud dream
 that play'st so subtly with a king's repose
 i am a king that find thee and i know
 tis not the balm the sceptre and the ball
 the sword the mace the crown imperial
 the intertissued robe of gold and pearl
 the farced title running fore the king
 the throne he sits on nor the tide of pomp
 that beats upon the high shore of this world
 no not all these thricegorgeous ceremony
 not all these laid in bed majestical
 can sleep so soundly as the wretched slave
 who with a body fill'd and vacant mind
 gets him to rest cramm'd with distressful bread
 never sees horrid night the child of hell
 but like a lackey from the rise to set
 sweats in the eye of phoebus and all night
 sleeps in elysium next day after dawn
 doth rise and help hyperion to his horse
 and follows so the everrunning year
 with profitable labour to his grave
 and but for ceremony such a wretch
 winding up days with toil and nights with sleep
 had the forehand and vantage of a king
 the slave a member of the country's peace
 enjoys it but in gross brain little wots
 what watch the king keeps to maintain the peace
 whose hours the peasant best advantages
 enter erpingham
erpingham my lord your nobles jealous of your absence
 seek through your camp to find you
king henry v good old knight
 collect them all together at my tent
 i'll be before thee
erpingham i shall do't my lord
 exit
king henry v o god of battles steel my soldiers hearts
 possess them not with fear take from them now
 the sense of reckoning if the opposed numbers
 pluck their hearts from them not today o lord
 o not today think not upon the fault
 my father made in compassing the crown
 i richard's body have interred anew
 and on it have bestow'd more contrite tears
 than from it issued forced drops of blood
 five hundred poor i have in yearly pay
 who twice aday their wither'd hands hold up
 toward heaven to pardon blood and i have built
 two chantries where the sad and solemn priests
 sing still for richard's soul more will i do
 though all that i can do is nothing worth
 since that my penitence comes after all
 imploring pardon
 enter gloucester
gloucester my liege
king henry v my brother gloucester's voice ay
 i know thy errand i will go with thee
 the day my friends and all things stay for me
