 that would not bless our europe with your daughter
 but rather lose her to an african
 where she at least is banish'd from your eye
 who hath cause to wet the grief on't
alonso prithee peace
sebastian you were kneel'd to and importuned otherwise
 by all of us and the fair soul herself
 weigh'd between loathness and obedience at
 which end o the beam should bow we have lost your
 son
 i fear for ever milan and naples have
 more widows in them of this business making
 than we bring men to comfort them
 the fault's your own
alonso so is the dear'st o the loss
gonzalo my lord sebastian
 the truth you speak doth lack some gentleness
 and time to speak it in you rub the sore
 when you should bring the plaster
sebastian very well
antonio and most chirurgeonly
gonzalo it is foul weather in us all good sir
 when you are cloudy
sebastian foul weather
antonio very foul
gonzalo had i plantation of this isle my lord
antonio he'ld sow't with nettleseed
sebastian or docks or mallows
gonzalo and were the king on't what would i do
sebastian scape being drunk for want of wine
gonzalo i the commonwealth i would by contraries
 execute all things for no kind of traffic
 would i admit no name of magistrate
 letters should not be known riches poverty
 and use of service none contract succession
 bourn bound of land tilth vineyard none
 no use of metal corn or wine or oil
 no occupation all men idle all
 and women too but innocent and pure
 no sovereignty
sebastian yet he would be king on't
antonio the latter end of his commonwealth forgets the
 beginning
gonzalo all things in common nature should produce
 without sweat or endeavour treason felony
 sword pike knife gun or need of any engine
 would i not have but nature should bring forth
 of its own kind all foison all abundance
 to feed my innocent people
sebastian no marrying mong his subjects
antonio none man all idle whores and knaves
gonzalo i would with such perfection govern sir
 to excel the golden age
sebastian god save his majesty
antonio long live gonzalo
gonzalo anddo you mark me sir
alonso prithee no more thou dost talk nothing to me
gonzalo i do well believe your highness and
 did it to minister occasion to these gentlemen
 who are of such sensible and nimble lungs that
 they always use to laugh at nothing
antonio twas you we laughed at
gonzalo who in this kind of merry fooling am nothing
 to you so you may continue and laugh at
 nothing still
antonio what a blow was there given
sebastian an it had not fallen flatlong
gonzalo you are gentlemen of brave metal you would lift
 the moon out of her sphere if she would continue
 in it five weeks without changing
 enter ariel invisible playing solemn music
sebastian we would so and then go a batfowling
antonio nay good my lord be not angry
gonzalo no i warrant you i will not adventure
 my discretion so weakly will you laugh
 me asleep for i am very heavy
antonio go sleep and hear us
 all sleep except alonso sebastian and antonio
alonso what all so soon asleep i wish mine eyes
 would with themselves shut up my thoughts i find
 they are inclined to do so
sebastian please you sir
 do not omit the heavy offer of it
 it seldom visits sorrow when it doth
 it is a comforter
antonio we two my lord
 will guard your person while you take your rest
 and watch your safety
alonso thank you wondrous heavy
 alonso sleeps exit ariel
sebastian what a strange drowsiness possesses them
antonio it is the quality o the climate
sebastian why
 doth it not then our eyelids sink i find not
 myself disposed to sleep
antonio nor i my spirits are nimble
 they fell together all as by consent
 they dropp'd as by a thunderstroke what might
 worthy sebastian o what mightno more
 and yet me thinks i see it in thy face
 what thou shouldst be the occasion speaks thee and
 my strong imagination sees a crown
 dropping upon thy head
sebastian what art thou waking
antonio do you not hear me speak
sebastian i do and surely
 it is a sleepy language and thou speak'st
 out of thy sleep what is it thou didst say
 this is a strange repose to be asleep
 with eyes wide open standing speaking moving
 and yet so fast asleep
antonio noble sebastian
 thou let'st thy fortune sleepdie rather wink'st
 whiles thou art waking
sebastian thou dost snore distinctly
 there's meaning in thy snores
antonio i am more serious than my custom you
 must be so too if heed me which to do
 trebles thee o'er
sebastian well i am standing water
antonio i'll teach you how to flow
sebastian do so to ebb
 hereditary sloth instructs me
antonio o
 if you but knew how you the purpose cherish
 whiles thus you mock it how in stripping it
 you more invest it ebbing men indeed
 most often do so near the bottom run
 by their own fear or sloth
sebastian prithee say on
 the setting of thine eye and cheek proclaim
 a matter from thee and a birth indeed
 which throes thee much to yield
antonio thus sir
 although this lord of weak remembrance this
 who shall be of as little memory
 when he is earth'd hath here almost persuade
 for he's a spirit of persuasion only
 professes to persuadethe king his son's alive
 tis as impossible that he's undrown'd
 and he that sleeps here swims
sebastian i have no hope
 that he's undrown'd
antonio o out of that no hope'
 what great hope have you no hope that way is
 another way so high a hope that even
 ambition cannot pierce a wink beyond
 but doubt discovery there will you grant with me
 that ferdinand is drown'd
sebastian he's gone
antonio then tell me
 who's the next heir of naples
sebastian claribel
antonio she that is queen of tunis she that dwells
 ten leagues beyond man's life she that from naples
 can have no note unless the sun were post
 the man i the moon's too slowtill newborn chins
 be rough and razorable she thatfrom whom
 we all were seaswallow'd though some cast again
 and by that destiny to perform an act
 whereof what's past is prologue what to come
 in yours and my discharge
sebastian what stuff is this how say you
 tis true my brother's daughter's queen of tunis
 so is she heir of naples twixt which regions
 there is some space
antonio a space whose every cubit
 seems to cry out how shall that claribel
 measure us back to naples keep in tunis
 and let sebastian wake say this were death
 that now hath seized them why they were no worse
 than now they are there be that can rule naples
 as well as he that sleeps lords that can prate
 as amply and unnecessarily
 as this gonzalo i myself could make
 a chough of as deep chat o that you bore
 the mind that i do what a sleep were this
 for your advancement do you understand me
sebastian methinks i do
antonio and how does your content
 tender your own good fortune
sebastian i remember
 you did supplant your brother prospero
antonio true
 and look how well my garments sit upon me
 much feater than before my brother's servants
 were then my fellows now they are my men
sebastian but for your conscience
antonio ay sir where lies that if twere a kibe
 twould put me to my slipper but i feel not
 this deity in my bosom twenty consciences
 that stand twixt me and milan candied be they
 and melt ere they molest here lies your brother
 no better than the earth he lies upon
 if he were that which now he's like that's dead
 whom i with this obedient steel three inches of it
 can lay to bed for ever whiles you doing thus
 to the perpetual wink for aye might put
 this ancient morsel this sir prudence who
 should not upbraid our course for all the rest
