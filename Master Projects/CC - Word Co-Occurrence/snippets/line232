 so in his red blood cassius day is set
 the sun of rome is set our day is gone
 clouds dews and dangers come our deeds are done
 mistrust of my success hath done this deed
messala mistrust of good success hath done this deed
 o hateful error melancholy's child
 why dost thou show to the apt thoughts of men
 the things that are not o error soon conceived
 thou never comest unto a happy birth
 but kill'st the mother that engender'd thee
titinius what pindarus where art thou pindarus
messala seek him titinius whilst i go to meet
 the noble brutus thrusting this report
 into his ears i may say thrusting it
 for piercing steel and darts envenomed
 shall be as welcome to the ears of brutus
 as tidings of this sight
titinius hie you messala
 and i will seek for pindarus the while
 exit messala
 why didst thou send me forth brave cassius
 did i not meet thy friends and did not they
 put on my brows this wreath of victory
 and bid me give it thee didst thou not hear their shouts
 alas thou hast misconstrued every thing
 but hold thee take this garland on thy brow
 thy brutus bid me give it thee and i
 will do his bidding brutus come apace
 and see how i regarded caius cassius
 by your leave godsthis is a roman's part
 come cassius sword and find titinius heart
 kills himself
 alarum reenter messala with brutus cato
 strato volumnius and lucilius
brutus where where messala doth his body lie
messala lo yonder and titinius mourning it
brutus titinius face is upward
cato he is slain
brutus o julius caesar thou art mighty yet
 thy spirit walks abroad and turns our swords
 in our own proper entrails
 low alarums
cato brave titinius
 look whether he have not crown'd dead cassius
brutus are yet two romans living such as these
 the last of all the romans fare thee well
 it is impossible that ever rome
 should breed thy fellow friends i owe more tears
 to this dead man than you shall see me pay
 i shall find time cassius i shall find time
 come therefore and to thasos send his body
 his funerals shall not be in our camp
 lest it discomfort us lucilius come
 and come young cato let us to the field
 labeo and flavius set our battles on
 tis three o'clock and romans yet ere night
 we shall try fortune in a second fight
 exeunt

scene iv another part of the field
 alarum enter fighting soldiers of both armies
 then brutus cato lucilius and others
brutus yet countrymen o yet hold up your heads
cato what bastard doth not who will go with me

 a foe to tyrants and my country's friend
 i am the son of marcus cato ho
brutus and i am brutus marcus brutus i
 brutus my country's friend know me for brutus
 exit
lucilius o young and noble cato art thou down
 why now thou diest as bravely as titinius
 and mayst be honour'd being cato's son
first soldier yield or thou diest
lucilius only i yield to die
 there is so much that thou wilt kill me straight
 offering money
 kill brutus and be honour'd in his death
first soldier we must not a noble prisoner
second soldier room ho tell antony brutus is ta'en
first soldier i'll tell the news here comes the general
 enter antony
 brutus is ta'en brutus is ta'en my lord
antony where is he
lucilius safe antony brutus is safe enough
 i dare assure thee that no enemy
 shall ever take alive the noble brutus
 the gods defend him from so great a shame
 when you do find him or alive or dead
 he will be found like brutus like himself
antony this is not brutus friend but i assure you
 a prize no less in worth keep this man safe
 give him all kindness i had rather have
 such men my friends than enemies go on
 and see whether brutus be alive or dead
 and bring us word unto octavius tent
 how every thing is chanced

scene v another part of the field
 enter brutus dardanius clitus strato and
 volumnius
brutus come poor remains of friends rest on this rock
clitus statilius show'd the torchlight but my lord
 he came not back he is or ta'en or slain
brutus sit thee down clitus slaying is the word
 it is a deed in fashion hark thee clitus
 whispers
clitus what i my lord no not for all the world
brutus peace then no words
clitus i'll rather kill myself
brutus hark thee dardanius
 whispers
dardanius shall i do such a deed
clitus o dardanius
dardanius o clitus
clitus what ill request did brutus make to thee
dardanius to kill him clitus look he meditates
clitus now is that noble vessel full of grief
 that it runs over even at his eyes
brutus come hither good volumnius list a word
volumnius what says my lord
brutus why this volumnius
 the ghost of caesar hath appear'd to me
 two several times by night at sardis once
 and this last night here in philippi fields
 i know my hour is come
volumnius not so my lord
brutus nay i am sure it is volumnius
 thou seest the world volumnius how it goes
 our enemies have beat us to the pit
 low alarums
 it is more worthy to leap in ourselves
 than tarry till they push us good volumnius
 thou know'st that we two went to school together
 even for that our love of old i prithee
 hold thou my swordhilts whilst i run on it
volumnius that's not an office for a friend my lord
 alarum still
clitus fly fly my lord there is no tarrying here
brutus farewell to you and you and you volumnius
 strato thou hast been all this while asleep
 farewell to thee too strato countrymen
 my heart doth joy that yet in all my life
 i found no man but he was true to me
 i shall have glory by this losing day
 more than octavius and mark antony
 by this vile conquest shall attain unto
 so fare you well at once for brutus tongue
 hath almost ended his life's history
 night hangs upon mine eyes my bones would rest
 that have but labour'd to attain this hour
 alarum cry within fly fly fly'
clitus fly my lord fly
brutus hence i will follow
 exeunt clitus dardanius and volumnius
 i prithee strato stay thou by thy lord
 thou art a fellow of a good respect
 thy life hath had some smatch of honour in it
 hold then my sword and turn away thy face
 while i do run upon it wilt thou strato
strato give me your hand first fare you well my lord
brutus farewell good strato
 runs on his sword
 caesar now be still
 i kill'd not thee with half so good a will
 dies
 alarum retreat enter octavius antony messala
 lucilius and the army
octavius what man is that
messala my master's man strato where is thy master
strato free from the bondage you are in messala
 the conquerors can but make a fire of him
 for brutus only overcame himself
 and no man else hath honour by his death
lucilius so brutus should be found i thank thee brutus
 that thou hast proved lucilius saying true
octavius all that served brutus i will entertain them
 fellow wilt thou bestow thy time with me
strato ay if messala will prefer me to you
octavius do so good messala
messala how died my master strato
strato i held the sword and he did run on it
messala octavius then take him to follow thee
 that did the latest service to my master
antony this was the noblest roman of them all
 all the conspirators save only he
 did that they did in envy of great caesar
 he only in a general honest thought
 and common good to all made one of them
 his life was gentle and the elements
 so mix'd in him that nature might stand up
 and say to all the world this was a man'
octavius according to his virtue let us use him
 with all respect and rites of burial
 within my tent his bones tonight shall lie
 most like a soldier order'd honourably
