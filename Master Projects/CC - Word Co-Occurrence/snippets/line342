sweets with sweets war not joy delights in joy
why lovest thou that which thou receivest not gladly
or else receivest with pleasure thine annoy
if the true concord of welltuned sounds
by unions married do offend thine ear
they do but sweetly chide thee who confounds
in singleness the parts that thou shouldst bear
mark how one string sweet husband to another
strikes each in each by mutual ordering
resembling sire and child and happy mother
who all in one one pleasing note do sing
 whose speechless song being many seeming one
 sings this to thee thou single wilt prove none'
ix
is it for fear to wet a widow's eye
that thou consumest thyself in single life
ah if thou issueless shalt hap to die
the world will wail thee like a makeless wife
the world will be thy widow and still weep
that thou no form of thee hast left behind
when every private widow well may keep
by children's eyes her husband's shape in mind
look what an unthrift in the world doth spend
shifts but his place for still the world enjoys it
but beauty's waste hath in the world an end
and kept unused the user so destroys it
 no love toward others in that bosom sits
 that on himself such murderous shame commits
x
for shame deny that thou bear'st love to any
who for thyself art so unprovident
grant if thou wilt thou art beloved of many
but that thou none lovest is most evident
for thou art so possess'd with murderous hate
that gainst thyself thou stick'st not to conspire
seeking that beauteous roof to ruinate
which to repair should be thy chief desire
o change thy thought that i may change my mind
shall hate be fairer lodged than gentle love
be as thy presence is gracious and kind
or to thyself at least kindhearted prove
 make thee another self for love of me
 that beauty still may live in thine or thee
xi
as fast as thou shalt wane so fast thou growest
in one of thine from that which thou departest
and that fresh blood which youngly thou bestowest
thou mayst call thine when thou from youth convertest
herein lives wisdom beauty and increase
without this folly age and cold decay
if all were minded so the times should cease
and threescore year would make the world away
let those whom nature hath not made for store
harsh featureless and rude barrenly perish
look whom she best endow'd she gave the more
which bounteous gift thou shouldst in bounty cherish
 she carved thee for her seal and meant thereby
 thou shouldst print more not let that copy die
xii
when i do count the clock that tells the time
and see the brave day sunk in hideous night
when i behold the violet past prime
and sable curls all silver'd o'er with white
when lofty trees i see barren of leaves
which erst from heat did canopy the herd
and summer's green all girded up in sheaves
borne on the bier with white and bristly beard
then of thy beauty do i question make
that thou among the wastes of time must go
since sweets and beauties do themselves forsake
and die as fast as they see others grow
 and nothing gainst time's scythe can make defence
 save breed to brave him when he takes thee hence
xiii
o that you were yourself but love you are
no longer yours than you yourself here live
against this coming end you should prepare
and your sweet semblance to some other give
so should that beauty which you hold in lease
find no determination then you were
yourself again after yourself's decease
when your sweet issue your sweet form should bear
who lets so fair a house fall to decay
which husbandry in honour might uphold
against the stormy gusts of winter's day
and barren rage of death's eternal cold
 o none but unthrifts dear my love you know
 you had a father let your son say so
xiv
not from the stars do i my judgment pluck
and yet methinks i have astronomy
but not to tell of good or evil luck
of plagues of dearths or seasons quality
nor can i fortune to brief minutes tell
pointing to each his thunder rain and wind
or say with princes if it shall go well
by oft predict that i in heaven find
but from thine eyes my knowledge i derive
and constant stars in them i read such art
as truth and beauty shall together thrive
if from thyself to store thou wouldst convert
 or else of thee this i prognosticate
 thy end is truth's and beauty's doom and date
xv
when i consider every thing that grows
holds in perfection but a little moment
that this huge stage presenteth nought but shows
whereon the stars in secret influence comment
when i perceive that men as plants increase
cheered and cheque'd even by the selfsame sky
vaunt in their youthful sap at height decrease
and wear their brave state out of memory
then the conceit of this inconstant stay
sets you most rich in youth before my sight
where wasteful time debateth with decay
to change your day of youth to sullied night
 and all in war with time for love of you
 as he takes from you i engraft you new
xvi
but wherefore do not you a mightier way
make war upon this bloody tyrant time
and fortify yourself in your decay
with means more blessed than my barren rhyme
now stand you on the top of happy hours
and many maiden gardens yet unset
with virtuous wish would bear your living flowers
much liker than your painted counterfeit
so should the lines of life that life repair
which this time's pencil or my pupil pen
neither in inward worth nor outward fair
can make you live yourself in eyes of men
 to give away yourself keeps yourself still
 and you must live drawn by your own sweet skill
xvii
who will believe my verse in time to come
if it were fill'd with your most high deserts
though yet heaven knows it is but as a tomb
which hides your life and shows not half your parts
if i could write the beauty of your eyes
and in fresh numbers number all your graces
the age to come would say this poet lies
such heavenly touches ne'er touch'd earthly faces'
so should my papers yellow'd with their age
be scorn'd like old men of less truth than tongue
and your true rights be term'd a poet's rage
and stretched metre of an antique song
 but were some child of yours alive that time
 you should live twice in it and in my rhyme
xviii
shall i compare thee to a summer's day
thou art more lovely and more temperate
rough winds do shake the darling buds of may
and summer's lease hath all too short a date
sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines
and often is his gold complexion dimm'd
and every fair from fair sometime declines
by chance or nature's changing course untrimm'd
but thy eternal summer shall not fade
nor lose possession of that fair thou owest
nor shall death brag thou wander'st in his shade
when in eternal lines to time thou growest
 so long as men can breathe or eyes can see
 so long lives this and this gives life to thee
xix
devouring time blunt thou the lion's paws
and make the earth devour her own sweet brood
pluck the keen teeth from the fierce tiger's jaws
and burn the longlived phoenix in her blood
make glad and sorry seasons as thou fleets
and do whate'er thou wilt swiftfooted time
to the wide world and all her fading sweets
but i forbid thee one most heinous crime
o carve not with thy hours my love's fair brow
nor draw no lines there with thine antique pen
him in thy course untainted do allow
for beauty's pattern to succeeding men
 yet do thy worst old time despite thy wrong
 my love shall in my verse ever live young
xx
a woman's face with nature's own hand painted
hast thou the mastermistress of my passion
a woman's gentle heart but not acquainted
with shifting change as is false women's fashion
an eye more bright than theirs less false in rolling
gilding the object whereupon it gazeth
a man in hue all hues in his controlling
much steals men's eyes and women's souls amazeth
and for a woman wert thou first created
till nature as she wrought thee fell adoting
and by addition me of thee defeated
by adding one thing to my purpose nothing
 but since she prick'd thee out for women's pleasure
 mine be thy love and thy love's use their treasure
xxi
so is it not with me as with that muse
stirr'd by a painted beauty to his verse
who heaven itself for ornament doth use
and every fair with his fair doth rehearse
making a couplement of proud compare
with sun and moon with earth and sea's rich gems
