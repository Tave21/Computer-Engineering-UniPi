and jesus arose and followed him and so did his disciples
and behold a woman which was diseased with an issue of blood twelve years came behind him and touched the hem of his garment
for she said within herself if i may but touch his garment i shall be whole
but jesus turned him about and when he saw her he said daughter be of good comfort thy faith hath made thee whole and the woman was made whole from that hour
and when jesus came into the ruler's house and saw the minstrels and the people making a noise
he said unto them give place for the maid is not dead but sleepeth and they laughed him to scorn
but when the people were put forth he went in and took her by the hand and the maid arose
and the fame hereof went abroad into all that land
and when jesus departed thence two blind men followed him crying and saying thou son of david have mercy on us
and when he was come into the house the blind men came to him and jesus saith unto them believe ye that i am able to do this they said unto him yea lord
then touched he their eyes saying according to your faith be it unto you
and their eyes were opened and jesus straitly charged them saying see that no man know it
but they when they were departed spread abroad his fame in all that country
as they went out behold they brought to him a dumb man possessed with a devil
and when the devil was cast out the dumb spake and the multitudes marvelled saying it was never so seen in israel
but the pharisees said he casteth out devils through the prince of the devils
and jesus went about all the cities and villages teaching in their synagogues and preaching the gospel of the kingdom and healing every sickness and every disease among the people
but when he saw the multitudes he was moved with compassion on them because they fainted and were scattered abroad as sheep having no shepherd
then saith he unto his disciples the harvest truly is plenteous but the labourers are few
pray ye therefore the lord of the harvest that he will send forth labourers into his harvest
and when he had called unto him his twelve disciples he gave them power against unclean spirits to cast them out and to heal all manner of sickness and all manner of disease
now the names of the twelve apostles are these the first simon who is called peter and andrew his brother james the son of zebedee and john his brother
philip and bartholomew thomas and matthew the publican james the son of alphaeus and lebbaeus whose surname was thaddaeus
simon the canaanite and judas iscariot who also betrayed him
these twelve jesus sent forth and commanded them saying go not into the way of the gentiles and into any city of the samaritans enter ye not
but go rather to the lost sheep of the house of israel
and as ye go preach saying the kingdom of heaven is at hand
heal the sick cleanse the lepers raise the dead cast out devils freely ye have received freely give
provide neither gold nor silver nor brass in your purses
nor scrip for your journey neither two coats neither shoes nor yet staves for the workman is worthy of his meat
and into whatsoever city or town ye shall enter enquire who in it is worthy and there abide till ye go thence
and when ye come into an house salute it
and if the house be worthy let your peace come upon it but if it be not worthy let your peace return to you
and whosoever shall not receive you nor hear your words when ye depart out of that house or city shake off the dust of your feet
verily i say unto you it shall be more tolerable for the land of sodom and gomorrha in the day of judgment than for that city
behold i send you forth as sheep in the midst of wolves be ye therefore wise as serpents and harmless as doves
but beware of men for they will deliver you up to the councils and they will scourge you in their synagogues
and ye shall be brought before governors and kings for my sake for a testimony against them and the gentiles
but when they deliver you up take no thought how or what ye shall speak for it shall be given you in that same hour what ye shall speak
for it is not ye that speak but the spirit of your father which speaketh in you
and the brother shall deliver up the brother to death and the father the child and the children shall rise up against their parents and cause them to be put to death
and ye shall be hated of all men for my name's sake but he that endureth to the end shall be saved
but when they persecute you in this city flee ye into another for verily i say unto you ye shall not have gone over the cities of israel till the son of man be come
the disciple is not above his master nor the servant above his lord
it is enough for the disciple that he be as his master and the servant as his lord if they have called the master of the house beelzebub how much more shall they call them of his household
fear them not therefore for there is nothing covered that shall not be revealed and hid that shall not be known
what i tell you in darkness that speak ye in light and what ye hear in the ear that preach ye upon the housetops
and fear not them which kill the body but are not able to kill the soul but rather fear him which is able to destroy both soul and body in hell
are not two sparrows sold for a farthing and one of them shall not fall on the ground without your father
but the very hairs of your head are all numbered
fear ye not therefore ye are of more value than many sparrows
whosoever therefore shall confess me before men him will i confess also before my father which is in heaven
but whosoever shall deny me before men him will i also deny before my father which is in heaven
think not that i am come to send peace on earth i came not to send peace but a sword
for i am come to set a man at variance against his father and the daughter against her mother and the daughter in law against her mother in law
and a man's foes shall be they of his own household
he that loveth father or mother more than me is not worthy of me and he that loveth son or daughter more than me is not worthy of me
and he that taketh not his cross and followeth after me is not worthy of me
he that findeth his life shall lose it and he that loseth his life for my sake shall find it
he that receiveth you receiveth me and he that receiveth me receiveth him that sent me
he that receiveth a prophet in the name of a prophet shall receive a prophet's reward and he that receiveth a righteous man in the name of a righteous man shall receive a righteous man's reward
and whosoever shall give to drink unto one of these little ones a cup of cold water only in the name of a disciple verily i say unto you he shall in no wise lose his reward
and it came to pass when jesus had made an end of commanding his twelve disciples he departed thence to teach and to preach in their cities
now when john had heard in the prison the works of christ he sent two of his disciples
and said unto him art thou he that should come or do we look for another
jesus answered and said unto them go and shew john again those things which ye do hear and see
the blind receive their sight and the lame walk the lepers are cleansed and the deaf hear the dead are raised up and the poor have the gospel preached to them
and blessed is he whosoever shall not be offended in me
and as they departed jesus began to say unto the multitudes concerning john what went ye out into the wilderness to see a reed shaken with the wind
but what went ye out for to see a man clothed in soft raiment behold they that wear soft clothing are in kings houses
but what went ye out for to see a prophet yea i say unto you and more than a prophet
for this is he of whom it is written behold i send my messenger before thy face which shall prepare thy way before thee
verily i say unto you among them that are born of women there hath not risen a greater than john the baptist notwithstanding he that is least in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he
and from the days of john the baptist until now the kingdom of heaven suffereth violence and the violent take it by force
for all the prophets and the law prophesied until john
and if ye will receive it this is elias which was for to come
he that hath ears to hear let him hear
but whereunto shall i liken this generation it is like unto children sitting in the markets and calling unto their fellows
and saying we have piped unto you and ye have not danced we have mourned unto you and ye have not lamented
for john came neither eating nor drinking and they say he hath a devil
the son of man came eating and drinking and they say behold a man gluttonous and a winebibber a friend of publicans and sinners but wisdom is justified of her children
then began he to upbraid the cities wherein most of his mighty works were done because they repented not
woe unto thee chorazin woe unto thee bethsaida for if the mighty works which were done in you had been done in tyre and sidon they would have repented long ago in sackcloth and ashes
but i say unto you it shall be more tolerable for tyre and sidon at the day of judgment than for you
and thou capernaum which art exalted unto heaven shalt be brought down to hell for if the mighty works which have been done in thee had been done in sodom it would have remained until this day
but i say unto you that it shall be more tolerable for the land of sodom in the day of judgment than for thee
at that time jesus answered and said i thank thee o father lord of heaven and earth because thou hast hid these things from the wise and prudent and hast revealed them unto babes
even so father for so it seemed good in thy sight
all things are delivered unto me of my father and no man knoweth the son but the father neither knoweth any man the father save the son and he to whomsoever the son will reveal him
come unto me all ye that labour and are heavy laden and i will give you rest
take my yoke upon you and learn of me for i am meek and lowly in heart and ye shall find rest unto your souls
for my yoke is easy and my burden is light
at that time jesus went on the sabbath day through the corn and his disciples were an hungred and began to pluck the ears of corn and to eat
but when the pharisees saw it they said unto him behold thy disciples do that which is not lawful to do upon the sabbath day
but he said unto them have ye not read what david did when he was an hungred and they that were with him
how he entered into the house of god and did eat the shewbread which was not lawful for him to eat neither for them which were with him but only for the priests
or have ye not read in the law how that on the sabbath days the priests in the temple profane the sabbath and are blameless
but i say unto you that in this place is one greater than the temple
but if ye had known what this meaneth i will have mercy and not sacrifice ye would not have condemned the guiltless
for the son of man is lord even of the sabbath day
and when he was departed thence he went into their synagogue
and behold there was a man which had his hand withered and they asked him saying is it lawful to heal on the sabbath days that they might accuse him
and he said unto them what man shall there be among you that shall have one sheep and if it fall into a pit on the sabbath day will he not lay hold on it and lift it out
how much then is a man better than a sheep wherefore it is lawful to do well on the sabbath days
then saith he to the man stretch forth thine hand and he stretched it forth and it was restored whole like as the other
then the pharisees went out and held a council against him how they might destroy him
but when jesus knew it he withdrew himself from thence and great multitudes followed him and he healed them all
and charged them that they should not make him known
that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by esaias the prophet saying
behold my servant whom i have chosen my beloved in whom my soul is well pleased i will put my spirit upon him and he shall shew judgment to the gentiles
he shall not strive nor cry neither shall any man hear his voice in the streets
a bruised reed shall he not break and smoking flax shall he not quench till he send forth judgment unto victory
and in his name shall the gentiles trust
then was brought unto him one possessed with a devil blind and dumb and he healed him insomuch that the blind and dumb both spake and saw
and all the people were amazed and said is not this the son of david
but when the pharisees heard it they said this fellow doth not cast out devils but by beelzebub the prince of the devils
and jesus knew their thoughts and said unto them every kingdom divided against itself is brought to desolation and every city or house divided against itself shall not stand
and if satan cast out satan he is divided against himself how shall then his kingdom stand
and if i by beelzebub cast out devils by whom do your children cast them out therefore they shall be your judges
but if i cast out devils by the spirit of god then the kingdom of god is come unto you
or else how can one enter into a strong man's house and spoil his goods except he first bind the strong man and then he will spoil his house
he that is not with me is against me and he that gathereth not with me scattereth abroad
wherefore i say unto you all manner of sin and blasphemy shall be forgiven unto men but the blasphemy against the holy ghost shall not be forgiven unto men
and whosoever speaketh a word against the son of man it shall be forgiven him but whosoever speaketh against the holy ghost it shall not be forgiven him neither in this world neither in the world to come
either make the tree good and his fruit good or else make the tree corrupt and his fruit corrupt for the tree is known by his fruit
o generation of vipers how can ye being evil speak good things for out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaketh
a good man out of the good treasure of the heart bringeth forth good things and an evil man out of the evil treasure bringeth forth evil things
but i say unto you that every idle word that men shall speak they shall give account thereof in the day of judgment
for by thy words thou shalt be justified and by thy words thou shalt be condemned
then certain of the scribes and of the pharisees answered saying master we would see a sign from thee
but he answered and said unto them an evil and adulterous generation seeketh after a sign and there shall no sign be given to it but the sign of the prophet jonas
for as jonas was three days and three nights in the whale's belly so shall the son of man be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth
the men of nineveh shall rise in judgment with this generation and shall condemn it because they repented at the preaching of jonas and behold a greater than jonas is here
the queen of the south shall rise up in the judgment with this generation and shall condemn it for she came from the uttermost parts of the earth to hear the wisdom of solomon and behold a greater than solomon is here
when the unclean spirit is gone out of a man he walketh through dry places seeking rest and findeth none
then he saith i will return into my house from whence i came out and when he is come he findeth it empty swept and garnished
then goeth he and taketh with himself seven other spirits more wicked than himself and they enter in and dwell there and the last state of that man is worse than the first even so shall it be also unto this wicked generation
while he yet talked to the people behold his mother and his brethren stood without desiring to speak with him
then one said unto him behold thy mother and thy brethren stand without desiring to speak with thee
but he answered and said unto him that told him who is my mother and who are my brethren
and he stretched forth his hand toward his disciples and said behold my mother and my brethren
for whosoever shall do the will of my father which is in heaven the same is my brother and sister and mother
the same day went jesus out of the house and sat by the sea side
and great multitudes were gathered together unto him so that he went into a ship and sat and the whole multitude stood on the shore
and he spake many things unto them in parables saying behold a sower went forth to sow
and when he sowed some seeds fell by the way side and the fowls came and devoured them up
some fell upon stony places where they had not much earth and forthwith they sprung up because they had no deepness of earth
and when the sun was up they were scorched and because they had no root they withered away
and some fell among thorns and the thorns sprung up and choked them
but other fell into good ground and brought forth fruit some an hundredfold some sixtyfold some thirtyfold
who hath ears to hear let him hear
and the disciples came and said unto him why speakest thou unto them in parables
he answered and said unto them because it is given unto you to know the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven but to them it is not given
for whosoever hath to him shall be given and he shall have more abundance but whosoever hath not from him shall be taken away even that he hath
therefore speak i to them in parables because they seeing see not and hearing they hear not neither do they understand
and in them is fulfilled the prophecy of esaias which saith by hearing ye shall hear and shall not understand and seeing ye shall see and shall not perceive
for this people's heart is waxed gross and their ears are dull of hearing and their eyes they have closed lest at any time they should see with their eyes and hear with their ears and should understand with their heart and should be converted and i should heal them
but blessed are your eyes for they see and your ears for they hear
for verily i say unto you that many prophets and righteous men have desired to see those things which ye see and have not seen them and to hear those things which ye hear and have not heard them
hear ye therefore the parable of the sower
when any one heareth the word of the kingdom and understandeth it not then cometh the wicked one and catcheth away that which was sown in his heart this is he which received seed by the way side
but he that received the seed into stony places the same is he that heareth the word and anon with joy receiveth it
yet hath he not root in himself but dureth for a while for when tribulation or persecution ariseth because of the word by and by he is offended
he also that received seed among the thorns is he that heareth the word and the care of this world and the deceitfulness of riches choke the word and he becometh unfruitful
but he that received seed into the good ground is he that heareth the word and understandeth it which also beareth fruit and bringeth forth some an hundredfold some sixty some thirty
another parable put he forth unto them saying the kingdom of heaven is likened unto a man which sowed good seed in his field
but while men slept his enemy came and sowed tares among the wheat and went his way
but when the blade was sprung up and brought forth fruit then appeared the tares also
so the servants of the householder came and said unto him sir didst not thou sow good seed in thy field from whence then hath it tares
he said unto them an enemy hath done this the servants said unto him wilt thou then that we go and gather them up
but he said nay lest while ye gather up the tares ye root up also the wheat with them
let both grow together until the harvest and in the time of harvest i will say to the reapers gather ye together first the tares and bind them in bundles to burn them but gather the wheat into my barn
another parable put he forth unto them saying the kingdom of heaven is like to a grain of mustard seed which a man took and sowed in his field
which indeed is the least of all seeds but when it is grown it is the greatest among herbs and becometh a tree so that the birds of the air come and lodge in the branches thereof
another parable spake he unto them the kingdom of heaven is like unto leaven which a woman took and hid in three measures of meal till the whole was leavened
all these things spake jesus unto the multitude in parables and without a parable spake he not unto them
that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet saying i will open my mouth in parables i will utter things which have been kept secret from the foundation of the world
then jesus sent the multitude away and went into the house and his disciples came unto him saying declare unto us the parable of the tares of the field
he answered and said unto them he that soweth the good seed is the son of man
the field is the world the good seed are the children of the kingdom but the tares are the children of the wicked one
the enemy that sowed them is the devil the harvest is the end of the world and the reapers are the angels
as therefore the tares are gathered and burned in the fire so shall it be in the end of this world
the son of man shall send forth his angels and they shall gather out of his kingdom all things that offend and them which do iniquity
and shall cast them into a furnace of fire there shall be wailing and gnashing of teeth
then shall the righteous shine forth as the sun in the kingdom of their father who hath ears to hear let him hear
again the kingdom of heaven is like unto treasure hid in a field the which when a man hath found he hideth and for joy thereof goeth and selleth all that he hath and buyeth that field
again the kingdom of heaven is like unto a merchant man seeking goodly pearls
who when he had found one pearl of great price went and sold all that he had and bought it
again the kingdom of heaven is like unto a net that was cast into the sea and gathered of every kind
which when it was full they drew to shore and sat down and gathered the good into vessels but cast the bad away
so shall it be at the end of the world the angels shall come forth and sever the wicked from among the just
and shall cast them into the furnace of fire there shall be wailing and gnashing of teeth
jesus saith unto them have ye understood all these things they say unto him yea lord
then said he unto them therefore every scribe which is instructed unto the kingdom of heaven is like unto a man that is an householder which bringeth forth out of his treasure things new and old
and it came to pass that when jesus had finished these parables he departed thence
and when he was come into his own country he taught them in their synagogue insomuch that they were astonished and said whence hath this man this wisdom and these mighty works
is not this the carpenter's son is not his mother called mary and his brethren james and joses and simon and judas
and his sisters are they not all with us whence then hath this man all these things
and they were offended in him but jesus said unto them a prophet is not without honour save in his own country and in his own house
and he did not many mighty works there because of their unbelief
