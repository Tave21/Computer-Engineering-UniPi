coriolanus come leave your tears a brief farewell the beast
 with many heads butts me away nay mother
 where is your ancient courage you were used
 to say extremity was the trier of spirits
 that common chances common men could bear
 that when the sea was calm all boats alike
 show'd mastership in floating fortune's blows
 when most struck home being gentle wounded craves
 a noble cunning you were used to load me
 with precepts that would make invincible
 the heart that conn'd them
virgilia o heavens o heavens
coriolanus nay prithee woman
volumnia now the red pestilence strike all trades in rome
 and occupations perish
coriolanus what what what
 i shall be loved when i am lack'd nay mother
 resume that spirit when you were wont to say
 if you had been the wife of hercules
 six of his labours you'ld have done and saved
 your husband so much sweat cominius
 droop not adieu farewell my wife my mother
 i'll do well yet thou old and true menenius
 thy tears are salter than a younger man's
 and venomous to thine eyes my sometime general
 i have seen thee stem and thou hast oft beheld
 hearthardening spectacles tell these sad women
 tis fond to wail inevitable strokes
 as tis to laugh at em my mother you wot well
 my hazards still have been your solace and
 believe't not lightlythough i go alone
 like to a lonely dragon that his fen
 makes fear'd and talk'd of more than seenyour son
 will or exceed the common or be caught
 with cautelous baits and practise
volumnia my first son
 whither wilt thou go take good cominius
 with thee awhile determine on some course
 more than a wild exposture to each chance
 that starts i the way before thee
coriolanus o the gods
cominius i'll follow thee a month devise with thee
 where thou shalt rest that thou mayst hear of us
 and we of thee so if the time thrust forth
 a cause for thy repeal we shall not send
 o'er the vast world to seek a single man
 and lose advantage which doth ever cool
 i the absence of the needer
coriolanus fare ye well
 thou hast years upon thee and thou art too full
 of the wars surfeits to go rove with one
 that's yet unbruised bring me but out at gate
 come my sweet wife my dearest mother and
 my friends of noble touch when i am forth
 bid me farewell and smile i pray you come
 while i remain above the ground you shall
 hear from me still and never of me aught
 but what is like me formerly
menenius that's worthily
 as any ear can hear come let's not weep
 if i could shake off but one seven years
 from these old arms and legs by the good gods
 i'ld with thee every foot
coriolanus give me thy hand come

 cats that can judge as fitly of his worth
 as i can of those mysteries which heaven
 will not have earth to know
brutus pray let us go
volumnia now pray sir get you gone

 whom you have banish'd does exceed you all
brutus well well we'll leave you
sicinius why stay we to be baited
 with one that wants her wits
volumnia take my prayers with you
 exeunt tribunes

 but to confirm my curses could i meet em
 but once aday it would unclog my heart
 of what lies heavy to't
menenius you have told them home
 and by my troth you have cause you'll sup with me
volumnia anger's my meat i sup upon myself
 and so shall starve with feeding come let's go
 leave this faint puling and lament as i do
 in anger junolike come come come

scene iii a highway between rome and antium
 enter a roman and a volsce meeting
roman i know you well sir and you know
 me your name i think is adrian
volsce it is so sir truly i have forgot you
roman i am a roman and my services are
 as you are against em know you me yet
volsce nicanor no
roman the same sir
volsce you had more beard when i last saw you but your
 favour is well approved by your tongue what's the
 news in rome i have a note from the volscian state
 to find you out there you have well saved me a
 day's journey
roman there hath been in rome strange insurrections the
 people against the senators patricians and nobles
volsce hath been is it ended then our state thinks not
 so they are in a most warlike preparation and
 hope to come upon them in the heat of their division
roman the main blaze of it is past but a small thing
 would make it flame again for the nobles receive
 so to heart the banishment of that worthy
 coriolanus that they are in a ripe aptness to take
 all power from the people and to pluck from them
 their tribunes for ever this lies glowing i can
 tell you and is almost mature for the violent
 breaking out
volsce coriolanus banished
roman banished sir
volsce you will be welcome with this intelligence nicanor
roman the day serves well for them now i have heard it
 said the fittest time to corrupt a man's wife is
 when she's fallen out with her husband your noble
 tullus aufidius will appear well in these wars his
 great opposer coriolanus being now in no request
 of his country
volsce he cannot choose i am most fortunate thus
 accidentally to encounter you you have ended my
 business and i will merrily accompany you home
roman i shall between this and supper tell you most
 strange things from rome all tending to the good of
 their adversaries have you an army ready say you
volsce a most royal one the centurions and their charges
 distinctly billeted already in the entertainment
 and to be on foot at an hour's warning
roman i am joyful to hear of their readiness and am the
 man i think that shall set them in present action
 so sir heartily well met and most glad of your company
volsce you take my part from me sir i have the most cause
 to be glad of yours
roman well let us go together
