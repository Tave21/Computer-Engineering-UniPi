 whereon to practise your severity
countess
of auvergne why art not thou the man
talbot i am indeed
countess
of auvergne then have i substance too
talbot no no i am but shadow of myself
 you are deceived my substance is not here
 for what you see is but the smallest part
 and least proportion of humanity
 i tell you madam were the whole frame here
 it is of such a spacious lofty pitch
 your roof were not sufficient to contain't
countess
of auvergne this is a riddling merchant for the nonce
 he will be here and yet he is not here
 how can these contrarieties agree
talbot that will i show you presently
 winds his horn drums strike up a peal of
 ordnance enter soldiers
 how say you madam are you now persuaded
 that talbot is but shadow of himself
 these are his substance sinews arms and strength
 with which he yoketh your rebellious necks
 razeth your cities and subverts your towns
 and in a moment makes them desolate
countess
of auvergne victorious talbot pardon my abuse
 i find thou art no less than fame hath bruited
 and more than may be gather'd by thy shape
 let my presumption not provoke thy wrath
 for i am sorry that with reverence
 i did not entertain thee as thou art
talbot be not dismay'd fair lady nor misconstrue
 the mind of talbot as you did mistake
 the outward composition of his body
 what you have done hath not offended me
 nor other satisfaction do i crave
 but only with your patience that we may
 taste of your wine and see what cates you have
 for soldiers stomachs always serve them well
countess
of auvergne with all my heart and think me honoured
 to feast so great a warrior in my house
 exeunt
 1 king henry vi
act ii
scene iv london the templegarden
 enter the earls of somerset suffolk and warwick
 richard plantagenet vernon and another lawyer
richard
plantagenet great lords and gentlemen what means this silence
 dare no man answer in a case of truth
suffolk within the templehall we were too loud
 the garden here is more convenient
richard
plantagenet then say at once if i maintain'd the truth
 or else was wrangling somerset in the error
suffolk faith i have been a truant in the law
 and never yet could frame my will to it
 and therefore frame the law unto my will
somerset judge you my lord of warwick then between us
warwick between two hawks which flies the higher pitch
 between two dogs which hath the deeper mouth
 between two blades which bears the better temper
 between two horses which doth bear him best
 between two girls which hath the merriest eye
 i have perhaps some shallow spirit of judgement
 but in these nice sharp quillets of the law
 good faith i am no wiser than a daw
richard
plantagenet tut tut here is a mannerly forbearance
 the truth appears so naked on my side
 that any purblind eye may find it out
somerset and on my side it is so well apparell'd
 so clear so shining and so evident
 that it will glimmer through a blind man's eye
richard
plantagenet since you are tonguetied and so loath to speak
 in dumb significants proclaim your thoughts
 let him that is a trueborn gentleman
 and stands upon the honour of his birth
 if he suppose that i have pleaded truth
 from off this brier pluck a white rose with me
somerset let him that is no coward nor no flatterer
 but dare maintain the party of the truth
 pluck a red rose from off this thorn with me
warwick i love no colours and without all colour
 of base insinuating flattery
 i pluck this white rose with plantagenet
suffolk i pluck this red rose with young somerset
 and say withal i think he held the right
vernon stay lords and gentlemen and pluck no more
 till you conclude that he upon whose side
 the fewest roses are cropp'd from the tree
 shall yield the other in the right opinion
somerset good master vernon it is well objected
 if i have fewest i subscribe in silence
richard
plantagenet and i
vernon then for the truth and plainness of the case
 i pluck this pale and maiden blossom here
 giving my verdict on the white rose side
somerset prick not your finger as you pluck it off
 lest bleeding you do paint the white rose red
 and fall on my side so against your will
vernon if i my lord for my opinion bleed
 opinion shall be surgeon to my hurt
 and keep me on the side where still i am
somerset well well come on who else
lawyer unless my study and my books be false
 the argument you held was wrong in you
 to somerset
 in sign whereof i pluck a white rose too
richard
plantagenet now somerset where is your argument
somerset here in my scabbard meditating that
 shall dye your white rose in a bloody red
richard
plantagenet meantime your cheeks do counterfeit our roses
 for pale they look with fear as witnessing
 the truth on our side
somerset no plantagenet
 tis not for fear but anger that thy cheeks
 blush for pure shame to counterfeit our roses
 and yet thy tongue will not confess thy error
richard
plantagenet hath not thy rose a canker somerset
somerset hath not thy rose a thorn plantagenet
richard
plantagenet ay sharp and piercing to maintain his truth
 whiles thy consuming canker eats his falsehood
somerset well i'll find friends to wear my bleeding roses
 that shall maintain what i have said is true
 where false plantagenet dare not be seen
richard
plantagenet now by this maiden blossom in my hand
 i scorn thee and thy fashion peevish boy
suffolk turn not thy scorns this way plantagenet
richard
plantagenet proud pole i will and scorn both him and thee
suffolk i'll turn my part thereof into thy throat
somerset away away good william de la pole
 we grace the yeoman by conversing with him
warwick now by god's will thou wrong'st him somerset
 his grandfather was lionel duke of clarence
 third son to the third edward king of england
 spring crestless yeomen from so deep a root
richard
plantagenet he bears him on the place's privilege
 or durst not for his craven heart say thus
somerset by him that made me i'll maintain my words
 on any plot of ground in christendom
 was not thy father richard earl of cambridge
 for treason executed in our late king's days
 and by his treason stand'st not thou attainted
 corrupted and exempt from ancient gentry
 his trespass yet lives guilty in thy blood
 and till thou be restored thou art a yeoman
richard
plantagenet my father was attached not attainted
 condemn'd to die for treason but no traitor
 and that i'll prove on better men than somerset
 were growing time once ripen'd to my will
 for your partaker pole and you yourself
 i'll note you in my book of memory
 to scourge you for this apprehension
 look to it well and say you are well warn'd
somerset ah thou shalt find us ready for thee still
 and know us by these colours for thy foes
 for these my friends in spite of thee shall wear
richard
plantagenet and by my soul this pale and angry rose
 as cognizance of my blooddrinking hate
 will i for ever and my faction wear
 until it wither with me to my grave
 or flourish to the height of my degree
suffolk go forward and be choked with thy ambition
 and so farewell until i meet thee next
 exit
somerset have with thee pole farewell ambitious richard
 exit
richard
plantagenet how i am braved and must perforce endure it
warwick this blot that they object against your house
 shall be wiped out in the next parliament
 call'd for the truce of winchester and gloucester
 and if thou be not then created york
 i will not live to be accounted warwick
 meantime in signal of my love to thee
 against proud somerset and william pole
 will i upon thy party wear this rose
 and here i prophesy this brawl today
 grown to this faction in the templegarden
 shall send between the red rose and the white
 a thousand souls to death and deadly night
richard
plantagenet good master vernon i am bound to you
 that you on my behalf would pluck a flower
vernon in your behalf still will i wear the same
