 excite the mortified man
angus near birnam wood
 shall we well meet them that way are they coming
caithness who knows if donalbain be with his brother
lennox for certain sir he is not i have a file
 of all the gentry there is siward's son
 and many unrough youths that even now
 protest their first of manhood
menteith what does the tyrant
caithness great dunsinane he strongly fortifies
 some say he's mad others that lesser hate him
 do call it valiant fury but for certain
 he cannot buckle his distemper'd cause
 within the belt of rule
angus now does he feel
 his secret murders sticking on his hands
 now minutely revolts upbraid his faithbreach
 those he commands move only in command
 nothing in love now does he feel his title
 hang loose about him like a giant's robe
 upon a dwarfish thief
menteith who then shall blame
 his pester'd senses to recoil and start
 when all that is within him does condemn
 itself for being there
caithness well march we on
 to give obedience where tis truly owed
 meet we the medicine of the sickly weal
 and with him pour we in our country's purge
 each drop of us
lennox or so much as it needs
 to dew the sovereign flower and drown the weeds
 make we our march towards birnam

macbeth bring me no more reports let them fly all
 till birnam wood remove to dunsinane
 i cannot taint with fear what's the boy malcolm
 was he not born of woman the spirits that know
 all mortal consequences have pronounced me thus
 fear not macbeth no man that's born of woman
 shall e'er have power upon thee then fly
 false thanes
 and mingle with the english epicures
 the mind i sway by and the heart i bear
 shall never sag with doubt nor shake with fear

 where got'st thou that goose look
servant there is ten thousand
macbeth geese villain

 exit servant
 seytoni am sick at heart
 when i beholdseyton i saythis push
 will cheer me ever or disseat me now
 i have lived long enough my way of life
 is fall'n into the sear the yellow leaf
 and that which should accompany old age
 as honour love obedience troops of friends
 i must not look to have but in their stead
 curses not loud but deep mouthhonour breath
 which the poor heart would fain deny and dare not seyton
 enter seyton
seyton what is your gracious pleasure
macbeth what news more
seyton all is confirm'd my lord which was reported
macbeth i'll fight till from my bones my flesh be hack'd
 give me my armour
seyton tis not needed yet
macbeth i'll put it on
 send out more horses skirr the country round
 hang those that talk of fear give me mine armour
 how does your patient doctor
doctor not so sick my lord
 as she is troubled with thick coming fancies
 that keep her from her rest
macbeth cure her of that
 canst thou not minister to a mind diseased
 pluck from the memory a rooted sorrow
 raze out the written troubles of the brain
 and with some sweet oblivious antidote
 cleanse the stuff'd bosom of that perilous stuff
 which weighs upon the heart
doctor therein the patient
 must minister to himself
macbeth throw physic to the dogs i'll none of it
 come put mine armour on give me my staff
 seyton send out doctor the thanes fly from me
 come sir dispatch if thou couldst doctor cast
 the water of my land find her disease
 and purge it to a sound and pristine health
 i would applaud thee to the very echo
 that should applaud againpull't off i say
 what rhubarb cyme or what purgative drug
 would scour these english hence hear'st thou of them
doctor ay my good lord your royal preparation
 makes us hear something
macbeth bring it after me
 i will not be afraid of death and bane
 till birnam forest come to dunsinane
doctor aside were i from dunsinane away and clear
 profit again should hardly draw me here

scene iv country near birnam wood
 drum and colours enter malcolm siward and young
 siward macduff menteith caithness angus
 lennox ross and soldiers marching
malcolm cousins i hope the days are near at hand
 that chambers will be safe
menteith we doubt it nothing
siward what wood is this before us
menteith the wood of birnam
malcolm let every soldier hew him down a bough
 and bear't before him thereby shall we shadow
 the numbers of our host and make discovery
 err in report of us
soldiers it shall be done
siward we learn no other but the confident tyrant
 keeps still in dunsinane and will endure
 our setting down before t
malcolm tis his main hope
 for where there is advantage to be given
 both more and less have given him the revolt
 and none serve with him but constrained things
 whose hearts are absent too
macduff let our just censures
 attend the true event and put we on
 industrious soldiership
siward the time approaches
 that will with due decision make us know
 what we shall say we have and what we owe
 thoughts speculative their unsure hopes relate
 but certain issue strokes must arbitrate
 towards which advance the war

act v
scene v dunsinane within the castle
 enter macbeth seyton and soldiers with drum
 and colours
macbeth hang out our banners on the outward walls
 the cry is still they come our castle's strength
 will laugh a siege to scorn here let them lie
 till famine and the ague eat them up
 were they not forced with those that should be ours
 we might have met them dareful beard to beard
 and beat them backward home
 a cry of women within
 what is that noise
seyton it is the cry of women my good lord
 exit
macbeth i have almost forgot the taste of fears
 the time has been my senses would have cool'd
 to hear a nightshriek and my fell of hair
 would at a dismal treatise rouse and stir
 as life were in't i have supp'd full with horrors
 direness familiar to my slaughterous thoughts
 cannot once start me
 reenter seyton
 wherefore was that cry
seyton the queen my lord is dead
macbeth she should have died hereafter
 there would have been a time for such a word
 tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow
 creeps in this petty pace from day to day
 to the last syllable of recorded time
 and all our yesterdays have lighted fools
 the way to dusty death out out brief candle
 life's but a walking shadow a poor player
 that struts and frets his hour upon the stage
 and then is heard no more it is a tale
 told by an idiot full of sound and fury
 signifying nothing
 enter a messenger
 thou comest to use thy tongue thy story quickly
messenger gracious my lord
 i should report that which i say i saw
 but know not how to do it
macbeth well say sir
messenger as i did stand my watch upon the hill
 i look'd toward birnam and anon methought
 the wood began to move
macbeth liar and slave
messenger let me endure your wrath if't be not so
 within this three mile may you see it coming
 i say a moving grove
macbeth if thou speak'st false
