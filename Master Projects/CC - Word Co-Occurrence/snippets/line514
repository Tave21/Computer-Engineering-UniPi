 what do you think of my daughter sir
pericles a most virtuous princess
simonides and she is fair too is she not
pericles as a fair day in summer wondrous fair
simonides sir my daughter thinks very well of you
 ay so well that you must be her master
 and she will be your scholar therefore look to it
pericles i am unworthy for her schoolmaster
simonides she thinks not so peruse this writing else
pericles aside what's here
 a letter that she loves the knight of tyre
 tis the king's subtlety to have my life
 o seek not to entrap me gracious lord
 a stranger and distressed gentleman
 that never aim'd so high to love your daughter
 but bent all offices to honour her
simonides thou hast bewitch'd my daughter and thou art
 a villain
pericles by the gods i have not
 never did thought of mine levy offence
 nor never did my actions yet commence
 a deed might gain her love or your displeasure
simonides traitor thou liest
pericles traitor
simonides ay traitor
pericles even in his throatunless it be the king
 that calls me traitor i return the lie
simonides aside now by the gods i do applaud his courage
pericles my actions are as noble as my thoughts
 that never relish'd of a base descent
 i came unto your court for honour's cause
 and not to be a rebel to her state
 and he that otherwise accounts of me
 this sword shall prove he's honour's enemy
simonides no
 here comes my daughter she can witness it
 enter thaisa
pericles then as you are as virtuous as fair
 resolve your angry father if my tongue
 did ere solicit or my hand subscribe
 to any syllable that made love to you
thaisa why sir say if you had
 who takes offence at that would make me glad
simonides yea mistress are you so peremptory
 aside
 i am glad on't with all my heart
 i'll tame you i'll bring you in subjection
 will you not having my consent
 bestow your love and your affections
 upon a stranger
 aside
 who for aught i know
 may be nor can i think the contrary
 as great in blood as i myself
 therefore hear you mistress either frame
 your will to mineand you sir hear you
 either be ruled by me or i will make you
 man and wife
 nay come your hands and lips must seal it too
 and being join'd i'll thus your hopes destroy
 and for a further griefgod give you joy
 what are you both pleased
thaisa yes if you love me sir
pericles even as my life or blood that fosters it
simonides what are you both agreed
both yes if it please your majesty
simonides it pleaseth me so well that i will see you wed
 and then with what haste you can get you to bed
 exeunt
 pericles prince of tyre
act iii
 enter gower
gower now sleep yslaked hath the rout
 no din but snores the house about
 made louder by the o'erfed breast
 of this most pompous marriagefeast
 the cat with eyne of burning coal
 now crouches fore the mouse's hole
 and crickets sing at the oven's mouth
 e'er the blither for their drouth
 hymen hath brought the bride to bed
 where by the loss of maidenhead
 a babe is moulded be attent
 and time that is so briefly spent
 with your fine fancies quaintly eche
 what's dumb in show i'll plain with speech
 dumb show
 enter pericles and simonides at one door with
 attendants a messenger meets them kneels and
 gives pericles a letter pericles shows it
 simonides the lords kneel to him then enter
 thaisa with child with lychorida a nurse the
 king shows her the letter she rejoices she and
 pericles takes leave of her father and depart with
 lychorida and their attendants then exeunt
 simonides and the rest
 by many a dern and painful perch
 of pericles the careful search
 by the four opposing coigns
 which the world together joins
 is made with all due diligence
 that horse and sail and high expense
 can stead the quest at last from tyre
 fame answering the most strange inquire
 to the court of king simonides
 are letters brought the tenor these
 antiochus and his daughter dead
 the men of tyrus on the head
 of helicanus would set on
 the crown of tyre but he will none
 the mutiny he there hastes t oppress
 says to em if king pericles
 come not home in twice six moons
 he obedient to their dooms
 will take the crown the sum of this
 brought hither to pentapolis
 yravished the regions round
 and every one with claps can sound
 our heirapparent is a king
 who dream'd who thought of such a thing'
 brief he must hence depart to tyre
 his queen with child makes her desire
 which who shall crossalong to go
 omit we all their dole and woe
 lychorida her nurse she takes
 and so to sea their vessel shakes
 on neptune's billow half the flood
 hath their keel cut but fortune's mood
 varies again the grisly north
 disgorges such a tempest forth
 that as a duck for life that dives
 so up and down the poor ship drives
 the lady shrieks and wellanear
 does fall in travail with her fear
 and what ensues in this fell storm
 shall for itself itself perform
 i nill relate action may
 conveniently the rest convey
 which might not what by me is told
 in your imagination hold
 this stage the ship upon whose deck
 the seatost pericles appears to speak
 exit
 pericles prince of tyre
act iii
scene i
 enter pericles on shipboard
pericles thou god of this great vast rebuke these surges
 which wash both heaven and hell and thou that hast
 upon the winds command bind them in brass
 having call'd them from the deep o still
 thy deafening dreadful thunders gently quench
 thy nimble sulphurous flashes o how lychorida
 how does my queen thou stormest venomously
 wilt thou spit all thyself the seaman's whistle
 is as a whisper in the ears of death
 unheard lychoridalucina o
 divinest patroness and midwife gentle
 to those that cry by night convey thy deity
 aboard our dancing boat make swift the pangs
 of my queen's travails
 enter lychorida with an infant
 now lychorida
lychorida here is a thing too young for such a place
 who if it had conceit would die as i
 am like to do take in your arms this piece
 of your dead queen
pericles how how lychorida
lychorida patience good sir do not assist the storm
 here's all that is left living of your queen
 a little daughter for the sake of it
 be manly and take comfort
pericles o you gods
 why do you make us love your goodly gifts
 and snatch them straight away we here below
 recall not what we give and therein may
 use honour with you
lychorida patience good sir
 even for this charge
pericles now mild may be thy life
 for a more blustrous birth had never babe
 quiet and gentle thy conditions for
 thou art the rudeliest welcome to this world
 that ever was prince's child happy what follows
 thou hast as chiding a nativity
 as fire air water earth and heaven can make
 to herald thee from the womb even at the first
 thy loss is more than can thy portage quit
 with all thou canst find here now the good gods
 throw their best eyes upon't
 enter two sailors
first sailor what courage sir god save you
pericles courage enough i do not fear the flaw
 it hath done to me the worst yet for the love
 of this poor infant this freshnew seafarer
 i would it would be quiet
first sailor slack the bolins there thou wilt not wilt thou
 blow and split thyself
second sailor but searoom an the brine and cloudy billow kiss
 the moon i care not
