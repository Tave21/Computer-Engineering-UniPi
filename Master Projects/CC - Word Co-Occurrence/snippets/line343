with april's firstborn flowers and all things rare
that heaven's air in this huge rondure hems
o let me true in love but truly write
and then believe me my love is as fair
as any mother's child though not so bright
as those gold candles fix'd in heaven's air
 let them say more than like of hearsay well
 i will not praise that purpose not to sell
xxii
my glass shall not persuade me i am old
so long as youth and thou are of one date
but when in thee time's furrows i behold
then look i death my days should expiate
for all that beauty that doth cover thee
is but the seemly raiment of my heart
which in thy breast doth live as thine in me
how can i then be elder than thou art
o therefore love be of thyself so wary
as i not for myself but for thee will
bearing thy heart which i will keep so chary
as tender nurse her babe from faring ill
 presume not on thy heart when mine is slain
 thou gavest me thine not to give back again
xxiii
as an unperfect actor on the stage
who with his fear is put besides his part
or some fierce thing replete with too much rage
whose strength's abundance weakens his own heart
so i for fear of trust forget to say
the perfect ceremony of love's rite
and in mine own love's strength seem to decay
o'ercharged with burden of mine own love's might
o let my books be then the eloquence
and dumb presagers of my speaking breast
who plead for love and look for recompense
more than that tongue that more hath more express'd
 o learn to read what silent love hath writ
 to hear with eyes belongs to love's fine wit
xxiv
mine eye hath play'd the painter and hath stell'd
thy beauty's form in table of my heart
my body is the frame wherein tis held
and perspective it is the painter's art
for through the painter must you see his skill
to find where your true image pictured lies
which in my bosom's shop is hanging still
that hath his windows glazed with thine eyes
now see what good turns eyes for eyes have done
mine eyes have drawn thy shape and thine for me
are windows to my breast wherethrough the sun
delights to peep to gaze therein on thee
 yet eyes this cunning want to grace their art
 they draw but what they see know not the heart
xxv
let those who are in favour with their stars
of public honour and proud titles boast
whilst i whom fortune of such triumph bars
unlook'd for joy in that i honour most
great princes favourites their fair leaves spread
but as the marigold at the sun's eye
and in themselves their pride lies buried
for at a frown they in their glory die
the painful warrior famoused for fight
after a thousand victories once foil'd
is from the book of honour razed quite
and all the rest forgot for which he toil'd
 then happy i that love and am beloved
 where i may not remove nor be removed
xxvi
lord of my love to whom in vassalage
thy merit hath my duty strongly knit
to thee i send this written embassage
to witness duty not to show my wit
duty so great which wit so poor as mine
may make seem bare in wanting words to show it
but that i hope some good conceit of thine
in thy soul's thought all naked will bestow it
till whatsoever star that guides my moving
points on me graciously with fair aspect
and puts apparel on my tatter'd loving
to show me worthy of thy sweet respect
 then may i dare to boast how i do love thee
 till then not show my head where thou mayst prove me
xxvii
weary with toil i haste me to my bed
the dear repose for limbs with travel tired
but then begins a journey in my head
to work my mind when body's work's expired
for then my thoughts from far where i abide
intend a zealous pilgrimage to thee
and keep my drooping eyelids open wide
looking on darkness which the blind do see
save that my soul's imaginary sight
presents thy shadow to my sightless view
which like a jewel hung in ghastly night
makes black night beauteous and her old face new
 lo thus by day my limbs by night my mind
 for thee and for myself no quiet find
xxviii
how can i then return in happy plight
that am debarr'd the benefit of rest
when day's oppression is not eased by night
but day by night and night by day oppress'd
and each though enemies to either's reign
do in consent shake hands to torture me
the one by toil the other to complain
how far i toil still farther off from thee
i tell the day to please them thou art bright
and dost him grace when clouds do blot the heaven
so flatter i the swartcomplexion'd night
when sparkling stars twire not thou gild'st the even
but day doth daily draw my sorrows longer
 and night doth nightly make grief's strength
 seem stronger
xxix
when in disgrace with fortune and men's eyes
i all alone beweep my outcast state
and trouble deal heaven with my bootless cries
and look upon myself and curse my fate
wishing me like to one more rich in hope
featured like him like him with friends possess'd
desiring this man's art and that man's scope
with what i most enjoy contented least
yet in these thoughts myself almost despising
haply i think on thee and then my state
like to the lark at break of day arising
from sullen earth sings hymns at heaven's gate
 for thy sweet love remember'd such wealth brings
 that then i scorn to change my state with kings
xxx
when to the sessions of sweet silent thought
i summon up remembrance of things past
i sigh the lack of many a thing i sought
and with old woes new wail my dear time's waste
then can i drown an eye unused to flow
for precious friends hid in death's dateless night
and weep afresh love's long since cancell'd woe
and moan the expense of many a vanish'd sight
then can i grieve at grievances foregone
and heavily from woe to woe tell o'er
the sad account of forebemoaned moan
which i new pay as if not paid before
 but if the while i think on thee dear friend
 all losses are restored and sorrows end
xxxi
thy bosom is endeared with all hearts
which i by lacking have supposed dead
and there reigns love and all love's loving parts
and all those friends which i thought buried
how many a holy and obsequious tear
hath dear religious love stol'n from mine eye
as interest of the dead which now appear
but things removed that hidden in thee lie
thou art the grave where buried love doth live
hung with the trophies of my lovers gone
who all their parts of me to thee did give
that due of many now is thine alone
 their images i loved i view in thee
 and thou all they hast all the all of me
xxxii
if thou survive my wellcontented day
when that churl death my bones with dust shall cover
and shalt by fortune once more resurvey
these poor rude lines of thy deceased lover
compare them with the bettering of the time
and though they be outstripp'd by every pen
reserve them for my love not for their rhyme
exceeded by the height of happier men
o then vouchsafe me but this loving thought
'had my friend's muse grown with this growing age
a dearer birth than this his love had brought
to march in ranks of better equipage
 but since he died and poets better prove
 theirs for their style i'll read his for his love'
xxxiii
full many a glorious morning have i seen
flatter the mountaintops with sovereign eye
kissing with golden face the meadows green
gilding pale streams with heavenly alchemy
anon permit the basest clouds to ride
with ugly rack on his celestial face
and from the forlorn world his visage hide
stealing unseen to west with this disgrace
even so my sun one early morn did shine
with all triumphant splendor on my brow
but out alack he was but one hour mine
the region cloud hath mask'd him from me now
 yet him for this my love no whit disdaineth
 suns of the world may stain when heaven's sun staineth
xxxiv
why didst thou promise such a beauteous day
and make me travel forth without my cloak
to let base clouds o'ertake me in my way
hiding thy bravery in their rotten smoke
'tis not enough that through the cloud thou break
to dry the rain on my stormbeaten face
for no man well of such a salve can speak
that heals the wound and cures not the disgrace
nor can thy shame give physic to my grief
though thou repent yet i have still the loss
