 i charge your charity withal leaving her
 the infant of your care beseeching you
 to give her princely training that she may be
 manner'd as she is born
cleon fear not my lord but think
 your grace that fed my country with your corn
 for which the people's prayers still fall upon you
 must in your child be thought on if neglection
 should therein make me vile the common body
 by you relieved would force me to my duty
 but if to that my nature need a spur
 the gods revenge it upon me and mine
 to the end of generation
pericles i believe you
 your honour and your goodness teach me to't
 without your vows till she be married madam
 by bright diana whom we honour all
 unscissor'd shall this hair of mine remain
 though i show ill in't so i take my leave
 good madam make me blessed in your care
 in bringing up my child
dionyza i have one myself
 who shall not be more dear to my respect
 than yours my lord
pericles madam my thanks and prayers
cleon we'll bring your grace e'en to the edge o the shore
 then give you up to the mask'd neptune and
 the gentlest winds of heaven
pericles i will embrace
 your offer come dearest madam o no tears
 lychorida no tears
 look to your little mistress on whose grace
 you may depend hereafter come my lord

scene iv ephesus a room in cerimon's house
 enter cerimon and thaisa
cerimon madam this letter and some certain jewels
 lay with you in your coffer which are now
 at your command know you the character
thaisa it is my lord's
 that i was shipp'd at sea i well remember
 even on my eaning time but whether there
 deliver'd by the holy gods
 i cannot rightly say but since king pericles
 my wedded lord i ne'er shall see again
 a vestal livery will i take me to
 and never more have joy
cerimon madam if this you purpose as ye speak
 diana's temple is not distant far
 where you may abide till your date expire
 moreover if you please a niece of mine
 shall there attend you
thaisa my recompense is thanks that's all
 yet my good will is great though the gift small

 enter gower
gower imagine pericles arrived at tyre
 welcomed and settled to his own desire
 his woeful queen we leave at ephesus
 unto diana there a votaress
 now to marina bend your mind
 whom our fastgrowing scene must find
 at tarsus and by cleon train'd
 in music letters who hath gain'd
 of education all the grace
 which makes her both the heart and place
 of general wonder but alack
 that monster envy oft the wrack
 of earned praise marina's life
 seeks to take off by treason's knife
 and in this kind hath our cleon
 one daughter and a wench full grown
 even ripe for marriagerite this maid
 hight philoten and it is said
 for certain in our story she
 would ever with marina be
 be't when she weaved the sleided silk
 with fingers long small white as milk
 or when she would with sharp needle wound
 the cambric which she made more sound
 by hurting it or when to the lute
 she sung and made the nightbird mute
 that still records with moan or when
 she would with rich and constant pen
 vail to her mistress dian still
 this philoten contends in skill
 with absolute marina so
 with the dove of paphos might the crow
 vie feathers white marina gets
 all praises which are paid as debts
 and not as given this so darks
 in philoten all graceful marks
 that cleon's wife with envy rare
 a present murderer does prepare
 for good marina that her daughter
 might stand peerless by this slaughter
 the sooner her vile thoughts to stead
 lychorida our nurse is dead
 and cursed dionyza hath
 the pregnant instrument of wrath
 prest for this blow the unborn event
 i do commend to your content
 only i carry winged time
 post on the lame feet of my rhyme
 which never could i so convey
 unless your thoughts went on my way
 dionyza does appear
 with leonine a murderer
 exit
 pericles prince of tyre
act iv
scene i tarsus an open place near the seashore
 enter dionyza and leonine
dionyza thy oath remember thou hast sworn to do't
 tis but a blow which never shall be known
 thou canst not do a thing in the world so soon
 to yield thee so much profit let not conscience
 which is but cold inflaming love i thy bosom
 inflame too nicely nor let pity which
 even women have cast off melt thee but be
 a soldier to thy purpose
leonine i will do't but yet she is a goodly creature
dionyza the fitter then the gods should have her here
 she comes weeping for her only mistress death
 thou art resolved
leonine i am resolved
 enter marina with a basket of flowers
marina no i will rob tellus of her weed
 to strew thy green with flowers the yellows blues
 the purple violets and marigolds
 shall as a carpet hang upon thy grave
 while summerdays do last ay me poor maid
 born in a tempest when my mother died
 this world to me is like a lasting storm
 whirring me from my friends
dionyza how now marina why do you keep alone
 how chance my daughter is not with you do not
 consume your blood with sorrowing you have
 a nurse of me lord how your favour's changed
 with this unprofitable woe
 come give me your flowers ere the sea mar it
 walk with leonine the air is quick there
 and it pierces and sharpens the stomach come
 leonine take her by the arm walk with her
marina no i pray you
 i'll not bereave you of your servant
dionyza come come
 i love the king your father and yourself
 with more than foreign heart we every day
 expect him here when he shall come and find
 our paragon to all reports thus blasted
 he will repent the breadth of his great voyage
 blame both my lord and me that we have taken
 no care to your best courses go i pray you
 walk and be cheerful once again reserve
 that excellent complexion which did steal
 the eyes of young and old care not for me
 i can go home alone
marina well i will go
 but yet i have no desire to it
dionyza come come i know tis good for you
 walk half an hour leonine at the least
 remember what i have said
leonine i warrant you madam
dionyza i'll leave you my sweet lady for a while
 pray walk softly do not heat your blood
 what i must have a care of you
marina my thanks sweet madam
 exit dionyza
 is this wind westerly that blows
leonine southwest
marina when i was born the wind was north
leonine was't so
marina my father as nurse said did never fear
 but cried good seaman to the sailors galling
 his kingly hands haling ropes
 and clasping to the mast endured a sea
 that almost burst the deck
leonine when was this
marina when i was born
 never was waves nor wind more violent
 and from the laddertackle washes off
 a canvasclimber ha says one wilt out'
 and with a dropping industry they skip
 from stem to stern the boatswain whistles and
 the master calls and trebles their confusion
leonine come say your prayers
marina what mean you
leonine if you require a little space for prayer
 i grant it pray but be not tedious
 for the gods are quick of ear and i am sworn
 to do my work with haste
marina why will you kill me
leonine to satisfy my lady
marina why would she have me kill'd
 now as i can remember by my troth
