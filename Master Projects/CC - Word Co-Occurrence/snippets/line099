moreover the word of the lord came to jeremiah saying
considerest thou not what this people have spoken saying the two families which the lord hath chosen he hath even cast them off thus they have despised my people that they should be no more a nation before them
thus saith the lord if my covenant be not with day and night and if i have not appointed the ordinances of heaven and earth
then will i cast away the seed of jacob and david my servant so that i will not take any of his seed to be rulers over the seed of abraham isaac and jacob for i will cause their captivity to return and have mercy on them
the word which came unto jeremiah from the lord when nebuchadnezzar king of babylon and all his army and all the kingdoms of the earth of his dominion and all the people fought against jerusalem and against all the cities thereof saying
thus saith the lord the god of israel go and speak to zedekiah king of judah and tell him thus saith the lord behold i will give this city into the hand of the king of babylon and he shall burn it with fire
and thou shalt not escape out of his hand but shalt surely be taken and delivered into his hand and thine eyes shall behold the eyes of the king of babylon and he shall speak with thee mouth to mouth and thou shalt go to babylon
yet hear the word of the lord o zedekiah king of judah thus saith the lord of thee thou shalt not die by the sword
but thou shalt die in peace and with the burnings of thy fathers the former kings which were before thee so shall they burn odours for thee and they will lament thee saying ah lord for i have pronounced the word saith the lord
then jeremiah the prophet spake all these words unto zedekiah king of judah in jerusalem
when the king of babylon's army fought against jerusalem and against all the cities of judah that were left against lachish and against azekah for these defenced cities remained of the cities of judah
this is the word that came unto jeremiah from the lord after that the king zedekiah had made a covenant with all the people which were at jerusalem to proclaim liberty unto them
that every man should let his manservant and every man his maidservant being an hebrew or an hebrewess go free that none should serve himself of them to wit of a jew his brother
now when all the princes and all the people which had entered into the covenant heard that every one should let his manservant and every one his maidservant go free that none should serve themselves of them any more then they obeyed and let them go
but afterward they turned and caused the servants and the handmaids whom they had let go free to return and brought them into subjection for servants and for handmaids
therefore the word of the lord came to jeremiah from the lord saying
thus saith the lord the god of israel i made a covenant with your fathers in the day that i brought them forth out of the land of egypt out of the house of bondmen saying
at the end of seven years let ye go every man his brother an hebrew which hath been sold unto thee and when he hath served thee six years thou shalt let him go free from thee but your fathers hearkened not unto me neither inclined their ear
and ye were now turned and had done right in my sight in proclaiming liberty every man to his neighbour and ye had made a covenant before me in the house which is called by my name
but ye turned and polluted my name and caused every man his servant and every man his handmaid whom he had set at liberty at their pleasure to return and brought them into subjection to be unto you for servants and for handmaids
therefore thus saith the lord ye have not hearkened unto me in proclaiming liberty every one to his brother and every man to his neighbour behold i proclaim a liberty for you saith the lord to the sword to the pestilence and to the famine and i will make you to be removed into all the kingdoms of the earth
and i will give the men that have transgressed my covenant which have not performed the words of the covenant which they had made before me when they cut the calf in twain and passed between the parts thereof
the princes of judah and the princes of jerusalem the eunuchs and the priests and all the people of the land which passed between the parts of the calf
i will even give them into the hand of their enemies and into the hand of them that seek their life and their dead bodies shall be for meat unto the fowls of the heaven and to the beasts of the earth
and zedekiah king of judah and his princes will i give into the hand of their enemies and into the hand of them that seek their life and into the hand of the king of babylon's army which are gone up from you
behold i will command saith the lord and cause them to return to this city and they shall fight against it and take it and burn it with fire and i will make the cities of judah a desolation without an inhabitant
the word which came unto jeremiah from the lord in the days of jehoiakim the son of josiah king of judah saying
go unto the house of the rechabites and speak unto them and bring them into the house of the lord into one of the chambers and give them wine to drink
then i took jaazaniah the son of jeremiah the son of habaziniah and his brethren and all his sons and the whole house of the rechabites
and i brought them into the house of the lord into the chamber of the sons of hanan the son of igdaliah a man of god which was by the chamber of the princes which was above the chamber of maaseiah the son of shallum the keeper of the door
and i set before the sons of the house of the rechabites pots full of wine and cups and i said unto them drink ye wine
but they said we will drink no wine for jonadab the son of rechab our father commanded us saying ye shall drink no wine neither ye nor your sons for ever
neither shall ye build house nor sow seed nor plant vineyard nor have any but all your days ye shall dwell in tents that ye may live many days in the land where ye be strangers
thus have we obeyed the voice of jonadab the son of rechab our father in all that he hath charged us to drink no wine all our days we our wives our sons nor our daughters
nor to build houses for us to dwell in neither have we vineyard nor field nor seed
but we have dwelt in tents and have obeyed and done according to all that jonadab our father commanded us
but it came to pass when nebuchadrezzar king of babylon came up into the land that we said come and let us go to jerusalem for fear of the army of the chaldeans and for fear of the army of the syrians so we dwell at jerusalem
then came the word of the lord unto jeremiah saying
thus saith the lord of hosts the god of israel go and tell the men of judah and the inhabitants of jerusalem will ye not receive instruction to hearken to my words saith the lord
the words of jonadab the son of rechab that he commanded his sons not to drink wine are performed for unto this day they drink none but obey their father's commandment notwithstanding i have spoken unto you rising early and speaking but ye hearkened not unto me
i have sent also unto you all my servants the prophets rising up early and sending them saying return ye now every man from his evil way and amend your doings and go not after other gods to serve them and ye shall dwell in the land which i have given to you and to your fathers but ye have not inclined your ear nor hearkened unto me
because the sons of jonadab the son of rechab have performed the commandment of their father which he commanded them but this people hath not hearkened unto me
therefore thus saith the lord god of hosts the god of israel behold i will bring upon judah and upon all the inhabitants of jerusalem all the evil that i have pronounced against them because i have spoken unto them but they have not heard and i have called unto them but they have not answered
and jeremiah said unto the house of the rechabites thus saith the lord of hosts the god of israel because ye have obeyed the commandment of jonadab your father and kept all his precepts and done according unto all that he hath commanded you
therefore thus saith the lord of hosts the god of israel jonadab the son of rechab shall not want a man to stand before me for ever
and it came to pass in the fourth year of jehoiakim the son of josiah king of judah that this word came unto jeremiah from the lord saying
take thee a roll of a book and write therein all the words that i have spoken unto thee against israel and against judah and against all the nations from the day i spake unto thee from the days of josiah even unto this day
it may be that the house of judah will hear all the evil which i purpose to do unto them that they may return every man from his evil way that i may forgive their iniquity and their sin
then jeremiah called baruch the son of neriah and baruch wrote from the mouth of jeremiah all the words of the lord which he had spoken unto him upon a roll of a book
and jeremiah commanded baruch saying i am shut up i cannot go into the house of the lord
therefore go thou and read in the roll which thou hast written from my mouth the words of the lord in the ears of the people in the lord's house upon the fasting day and also thou shalt read them in the ears of all judah that come out of their cities
it may be they will present their supplication before the lord and will return every one from his evil way for great is the anger and the fury that the lord hath pronounced against this people
and baruch the son of neriah did according to all that jeremiah the prophet commanded him reading in the book the words of the lord in the lord's house
and it came to pass in the fifth year of jehoiakim the son of josiah king of judah in the ninth month that they proclaimed a fast before the lord to all the people in jerusalem and to all the people that came from the cities of judah unto jerusalem
then read baruch in the book the words of jeremiah in the house of the lord in the chamber of gemariah the son of shaphan the scribe in the higher court at the entry of the new gate of the lord's house in the ears of all the people
when michaiah the son of gemariah the son of shaphan had heard out of the book all the words of the lord
then he went down into the king's house into the scribe's chamber and lo all the princes sat there even elishama the scribe and delaiah the son of shemaiah and elnathan the son of achbor and gemariah the son of shaphan and zedekiah the son of hananiah and all the princes
then michaiah declared unto them all the words that he had heard when baruch read the book in the ears of the people
therefore all the princes sent jehudi the son of nethaniah the son of shelemiah the son of cushi unto baruch saying take in thine hand the roll wherein thou hast read in the ears of the people and come so baruch the son of neriah took the roll in his hand and came unto them
and they said unto him sit down now and read it in our ears so baruch read it in their ears
now it came to pass when they had heard all the words they were afraid both one and other and said unto baruch we will surely tell the king of all these words
and they asked baruch saying tell us now how didst thou write all these words at his mouth
then baruch answered them he pronounced all these words unto me with his mouth and i wrote them with ink in the book
then said the princes unto baruch go hide thee thou and jeremiah and let no man know where ye be
and they went in to the king into the court but they laid up the roll in the chamber of elishama the scribe and told all the words in the ears of the king
so the king sent jehudi to fetch the roll and he took it out of elishama the scribe's chamber and jehudi read it in the ears of the king and in the ears of all the princes which stood beside the king
now the king sat in the winterhouse in the ninth month and there was a fire on the hearth burning before him
and it came to pass that when jehudi had read three or four leaves he cut it with the penknife and cast it into the fire that was on the hearth until all the roll was consumed in the fire that was on the hearth
yet they were not afraid nor rent their garments neither the king nor any of his servants that heard all these words
nevertheless elnathan and delaiah and gemariah had made intercession to the king that he would not burn the roll but he would not hear them
but the king commanded jerahmeel the son of hammelech and seraiah the son of azriel and shelemiah the son of abdeel to take baruch the scribe and jeremiah the prophet but the lord hid them
then the word of the lord came to jeremiah after that the king had burned the roll and the words which baruch wrote at the mouth of jeremiah saying
take thee again another roll and write in it all the former words that were in the first roll which jehoiakim the king of judah hath burned
and thou shalt say to jehoiakim king of judah thus saith the lord thou hast burned this roll saying why hast thou written therein saying the king of babylon shall certainly come and destroy this land and shall cause to cease from thence man and beast
therefore thus saith the lord of jehoiakim king of judah he shall have none to sit upon the throne of david and his dead body shall be cast out in the day to the heat and in the night to the frost
and i will punish him and his seed and his servants for their iniquity and i will bring upon them and upon the inhabitants of jerusalem and upon the men of judah all the evil that i have pronounced against them but they hearkened not
then took jeremiah another roll and gave it to baruch the scribe the son of neriah who wrote therein from the mouth of jeremiah all the words of the book which jehoiakim king of judah had burned in the fire and there were added besides unto them many like words
and king zedekiah the son of josiah reigned instead of coniah the son of jehoiakim whom nebuchadrezzar king of babylon made king in the land of judah
but neither he nor his servants nor the people of the land did hearken unto the words of the lord which he spake by the prophet jeremiah
and zedekiah the king sent jehucal the son of shelemiah and zephaniah the son of maaseiah the priest to the prophet jeremiah saying pray now unto the lord our god for us
now jeremiah came in and went out among the people for they had not put him into prison
then pharaoh's army was come forth out of egypt and when the chaldeans that besieged jerusalem heard tidings of them they departed from jerusalem
then came the word of the lord unto the prophet jeremiah saying
thus saith the lord the god of israel thus shall ye say to the king of judah that sent you unto me to enquire of me behold pharaoh's army which is come forth to help you shall return to egypt into their own land
and the chaldeans shall come again and fight against this city and take it and burn it with fire
thus saith the lord deceive not yourselves saying the chaldeans shall surely depart from us for they shall not depart
for though ye had smitten the whole army of the chaldeans that fight against you and there remained but wounded men among them yet should they rise up every man in his tent and burn this city with fire
and it came to pass that when the army of the chaldeans was broken up from jerusalem for fear of pharaoh's army
then jeremiah went forth out of jerusalem to go into the land of benjamin to separate himself thence in the midst of the people
and when he was in the gate of benjamin a captain of the ward was there whose name was irijah the son of shelemiah the son of hananiah and he took jeremiah the prophet saying thou fallest away to the chaldeans
then said jeremiah it is false i fall not away to the chaldeans but he hearkened not to him so irijah took jeremiah and brought him to the princes
wherefore the princes were wroth with jeremiah and smote him and put him in prison in the house of jonathan the scribe for they had made that the prison
when jeremiah was entered into the dungeon and into the cabins and jeremiah had remained there many days
then zedekiah the king sent and took him out and the king asked him secretly in his house and said is there any word from the lord and jeremiah said there is for said he thou shalt be delivered into the hand of the king of babylon
moreover jeremiah said unto king zedekiah what have i offended against thee or against thy servants or against this people that ye have put me in prison
where are now your prophets which prophesied unto you saying the king of babylon shall not come against you nor against this land
therefore hear now i pray thee o my lord the king let my supplication i pray thee be accepted before thee that thou cause me not to return to the house of jonathan the scribe lest i die there
then zedekiah the king commanded that they should commit jeremiah into the court of the prison and that they should give him daily a piece of bread out of the bakers street until all the bread in the city were spent thus jeremiah remained in the court of the prison
then shephatiah the son of mattan and gedaliah the son of pashur and jucal the son of shelemiah and pashur the son of malchiah heard the words that jeremiah had spoken unto all the people saying
thus saith the lord he that remaineth in this city shall die by the sword by the famine and by the pestilence but he that goeth forth to the chaldeans shall live for he shall have his life for a prey and shall live
thus saith the lord this city shall surely be given into the hand of the king of babylon's army which shall take it
therefore the princes said unto the king we beseech thee let this man be put to death for thus he weakeneth the hands of the men of war that remain in this city and the hands of all the people in speaking such words unto them for this man seeketh not the welfare of this people but the hurt
then zedekiah the king said behold he is in your hand for the king is not he that can do any thing against you
then took they jeremiah and cast him into the dungeon of malchiah the son of hammelech that was in the court of the prison and they let down jeremiah with cords and in the dungeon there was no water but mire so jeremiah sunk in the mire
now when ebedmelech the ethiopian one of the eunuchs which was in the king's house heard that they had put jeremiah in the dungeon the king then sitting in the gate of benjamin
ebedmelech went forth out of the king's house and spake to the king saying
my lord the king these men have done evil in all that they have done to jeremiah the prophet whom they have cast into the dungeon and he is like to die for hunger in the place where he is for there is no more bread in the city
then the king commanded ebedmelech the ethiopian saying take from hence thirty men with thee and take up jeremiah the prophet out of the dungeon before he die
so ebedmelech took the men with him and went into the house of the king under the treasury and took thence old cast clouts and old rotten rags and let them down by cords into the dungeon to jeremiah
and ebedmelech the ethiopian said unto jeremiah put now these old cast clouts and rotten rags under thine armholes under the cords and jeremiah did so
so they drew up jeremiah with cords and took him up out of the dungeon and jeremiah remained in the court of the prison
then zedekiah the king sent and took jeremiah the prophet unto him into the third entry that is in the house of the lord and the king said unto jeremiah i will ask thee a thing hide nothing from me
then jeremiah said unto zedekiah if i declare it unto thee wilt thou not surely put me to death and if i give thee counsel wilt thou not hearken unto me
so zedekiah the king sware secretly unto jeremiah saying as the lord liveth that made us this soul i will not put thee to death neither will i give thee into the hand of these men that seek thy life
then said jeremiah unto zedekiah thus saith the lord the god of hosts the god of israel if thou wilt assuredly go forth unto the king of babylon's princes then thy soul shall live and this city shall not be burned with fire and thou shalt live and thine house
but if thou wilt not go forth to the king of babylon's princes then shall this city be given into the hand of the chaldeans and they shall burn it with fire and thou shalt not escape out of their hand
and zedekiah the king said unto jeremiah i am afraid of the jews that are fallen to the chaldeans lest they deliver me into their hand and they mock me
but jeremiah said they shall not deliver thee obey i beseech thee the voice of the lord which i speak unto thee so it shall be well unto thee and thy soul shall live
but if thou refuse to go forth this is the word that the lord hath shewed me
and behold all the women that are left in the king of judah's house shall be brought forth to the king of babylon's princes and those women shall say thy friends have set thee on and have prevailed against thee thy feet are sunk in the mire and they are turned away back
so they shall bring out all thy wives and thy children to the chaldeans and thou shalt not escape out of their hand but shalt be taken by the hand of the king of babylon and thou shalt cause this city to be burned with fire
then said zedekiah unto jeremiah let no man know of these words and thou shalt not die
but if the princes hear that i have talked with thee and they come unto thee and say unto thee declare unto us now what thou hast said unto the king hide it not from us and we will not put thee to death also what the king said unto thee
then thou shalt say unto them i presented my supplication before the king that he would not cause me to return to jonathan's house to die there
then came all the princes unto jeremiah and asked him and he told them according to all these words that the king had commanded so they left off speaking with him for the matter was not perceived
so jeremiah abode in the court of the prison until the day that jerusalem was taken and he was there when jerusalem was taken
in the ninth year of zedekiah king of judah in the tenth month came nebuchadrezzar king of babylon and all his army against jerusalem and they besieged it
and in the eleventh year of zedekiah in the fourth month the ninth day of the month the city was broken up
and all the princes of the king of babylon came in and sat in the middle gate even nergalsharezer samgarnebo sarsechim rabsaris nergalsharezer rabmag with all the residue of the princes of the king of babylon
and it came to pass that when zedekiah the king of judah saw them and all the men of war then they fled and went forth out of the city by night by the way of the king's garden by the gate betwixt the two walls and he went out the way of the plain
but the chaldeans army pursued after them and overtook zedekiah in the plains of jericho and when they had taken him they brought him up to nebuchadnezzar king of babylon to riblah in the land of hamath where he gave judgment upon him
then the king of babylon slew the sons of zedekiah in riblah before his eyes also the king of babylon slew all the nobles of judah
moreover he put out zedekiah's eyes and bound him with chains to carry him to babylon
and the chaldeans burned the king's house and the houses of the people with fire and brake down the walls of jerusalem
then nebuzaradan the captain of the guard carried away captive into babylon the remnant of the people that remained in the city and those that fell away that fell to him with the rest of the people that remained
but nebuzaradan the captain of the guard left of the poor of the people which had nothing in the land of judah and gave them vineyards and fields at the same time
now nebuchadrezzar king of babylon gave charge concerning jeremiah to nebuzaradan the captain of the guard saying
take him and look well to him and do him no harm but do unto him even as he shall say unto thee
so nebuzaradan the captain of the guard sent and nebushasban rabsaris and nergalsharezer rabmag and all the king of babylon's princes
even they sent and took jeremiah out of the court of the prison and committed him unto gedaliah the son of ahikam the son of shaphan that he should carry him home so he dwelt among the people
now the word of the lord came unto jeremiah while he was shut up in the court of the prison saying
go and speak to ebedmelech the ethiopian saying thus saith the lord of hosts the god of israel behold i will bring my words upon this city for evil and not for good and they shall be accomplished in that day before thee
but i will deliver thee in that day saith the lord and thou shalt not be given into the hand of the men of whom thou art afraid
for i will surely deliver thee and thou shalt not fall by the sword but thy life shall be for a prey unto thee because thou hast put thy trust in me saith the lord
the word that came to jeremiah from the lord after that nebuzaradan the captain of the guard had let him go from ramah when he had taken him being bound in chains among all that were carried away captive of jerusalem and judah which were carried away captive unto babylon
and the captain of the guard took jeremiah and said unto him the lord thy god hath pronounced this evil upon this place
now the lord hath brought it and done according as he hath said because ye have sinned against the lord and have not obeyed his voice therefore this thing is come upon you
and now behold i loose thee this day from the chains which were upon thine hand if it seem good unto thee to come with me into babylon come and i will look well unto thee but if it seem ill unto thee to come with me into babylon forbear behold all the land is before thee whither it seemeth good and convenient for thee to go thither go
now while he was not yet gone back he said go back also to gedaliah the son of ahikam the son of shaphan whom the king of babylon hath made governor over the cities of judah and dwell with him among the people or go wheresoever it seemeth convenient unto thee to go so the captain of the guard gave him victuals and a reward and let him go
then went jeremiah unto gedaliah the son of ahikam to mizpah and dwelt with him among the people that were left in the land
now when all the captains of the forces which were in the fields even they and their men heard that the king of babylon had made gedaliah the son of ahikam governor in the land and had committed unto him men and women and children and of the poor of the land of them that were not carried away captive to babylon
then they came to gedaliah to mizpah even ishmael the son of nethaniah and johanan and jonathan the sons of kareah and seraiah the son of tanhumeth and the sons of ephai the netophathite and jezaniah the son of a maachathite they and their men
and gedaliah the son of ahikam the son of shaphan sware unto them and to their men saying fear not to serve the chaldeans dwell in the land and serve the king of babylon and it shall be well with you
as for me behold i will dwell at mizpah to serve the chaldeans which will come unto us but ye gather ye wine and summer fruits and oil and put them in your vessels and dwell in your cities that ye have taken
likewise when all the jews that were in moab and among the ammonites and in edom and that were in all the countries heard that the king of babylon had left a remnant of judah and that he had set over them gedaliah the son of ahikam the son of shaphan
even all the jews returned out of all places whither they were driven and came to the land of judah to gedaliah unto mizpah and gathered wine and summer fruits very much
moreover johanan the son of kareah and all the captains of the forces that were in the fields came to gedaliah to mizpah
and said unto him dost thou certainly know that baalis the king of the ammonites hath sent ishmael the son of nethaniah to slay thee but gedaliah the son of ahikam believed them not
then johanan the son of kareah spake to gedaliah in mizpah secretly saying let me go i pray thee and i will slay ishmael the son of nethaniah and no man shall know it wherefore should he slay thee that all the jews which are gathered unto thee should be scattered and the remnant in judah perish
but gedaliah the son of ahikam said unto johanan the son of kareah thou shalt not do this thing for thou speakest falsely of ishmael
now it came to pass in the seventh month that ishmael the son of nethaniah the son of elishama of the seed royal and the princes of the king even ten men with him came unto gedaliah the son of ahikam to mizpah and there they did eat bread together in mizpah
then arose ishmael the son of nethaniah and the ten men that were with him and smote gedaliah the son of ahikam the son of shaphan with the sword and slew him whom the king of babylon had made governor over the land
ishmael also slew all the jews that were with him even with gedaliah at mizpah and the chaldeans that were found there and the men of war
and it came to pass the second day after he had slain gedaliah and no man knew it
that there came certain from shechem from shiloh and from samaria even fourscore men having their beards shaven and their clothes rent and having cut themselves with offerings and incense in their hand to bring them to the house of the lord
and ishmael the son of nethaniah went forth from mizpah to meet them weeping all along as he went and it came to pass as he met them he said unto them come to gedaliah the son of ahikam
and it was so when they came into the midst of the city that ishmael the son of nethaniah slew them and cast them into the midst of the pit he and the men that were with him
but ten men were found among them that said unto ishmael slay us not for we have treasures in the field of wheat and of barley and of oil and of honey so he forbare and slew them not among their brethren
now the pit wherein ishmael had cast all the dead bodies of the men whom he had slain because of gedaliah was it which asa the king had made for fear of baasha king of israel and ishmael the son of nethaniah filled it with them that were slain
then ishmael carried away captive all the residue of the people that were in mizpah even the king's daughters and all the people that remained in mizpah whom nebuzaradan the captain of the guard had committed to gedaliah the son of ahikam and ishmael the son of nethaniah carried them away captive and departed to go over to the ammonites
but when johanan the son of kareah and all the captains of the forces that were with him heard of all the evil that ishmael the son of nethaniah had done
then they took all the men and went to fight with ishmael the son of nethaniah and found him by the great waters that are in gibeon
now it came to pass that when all the people which were with ishmael saw johanan the son of kareah and all the captains of the forces that were with him then they were glad
so all the people that ishmael had carried away captive from mizpah cast about and returned and went unto johanan the son of kareah
but ishmael the son of nethaniah escaped from johanan with eight men and went to the ammonites
then took johanan the son of kareah and all the captains of the forces that were with him all the remnant of the people whom he had recovered from ishmael the son of nethaniah from mizpah after that he had slain gedaliah the son of ahikam even mighty men of war and the women and the children and the eunuchs whom he had brought again from gibeon
and they departed and dwelt in the habitation of chimham which is by bethlehem to go to enter into egypt
because of the chaldeans for they were afraid of them because ishmael the son of nethaniah had slain gedaliah the son of ahikam whom the king of babylon made governor in the land
then all the captains of the forces and johanan the son of kareah and jezaniah the son of hoshaiah and all the people from the least even unto the greatest came near
and said unto jeremiah the prophet let we beseech thee our supplication be accepted before thee and pray for us unto the lord thy god even for all this remnant for we are left but a few of many as thine eyes do behold us
that the lord thy god may shew us the way wherein we may walk and the thing that we may do
then jeremiah the prophet said unto them i have heard you behold i will pray unto the lord your god according to your words and it shall come to pass that whatsoever thing the lord shall answer you i will declare it unto you i will keep nothing back from you
then they said to jeremiah the lord be a true and faithful witness between us if we do not even according to all things for the which the lord thy god shall send thee to us
whether it be good or whether it be evil we will obey the voice of the lord our god to whom we send thee that it may be well with us when we obey the voice of the lord our god
and it came to pass after ten days that the word of the lord came unto jeremiah
then called he johanan the son of kareah and all the captains of the forces which were with him and all the people from the least even to the greatest
and said unto them thus saith the lord the god of israel unto whom ye sent me to present your supplication before him
if ye will still abide in this land then will i build you and not pull you down and i will plant you and not pluck you up for i repent me of the evil that i have done unto you
be not afraid of the king of babylon of whom ye are afraid be not afraid of him saith the lord for i am with you to save you and to deliver you from his hand
and i will shew mercies unto you that he may have mercy upon you and cause you to return to your own land
but if ye say we will not dwell in this land neither obey the voice of the lord your god
saying no but we will go into the land of egypt where we shall see no war nor hear the sound of the trumpet nor have hunger of bread and there will we dwell
and now therefore hear the word of the lord ye remnant of judah thus saith the lord of hosts the god of israel if ye wholly set your faces to enter into egypt and go to sojourn there
then it shall come to pass that the sword which ye feared shall overtake you there in the land of egypt and the famine whereof ye were afraid shall follow close after you there in egypt and there ye shall die
so shall it be with all the men that set their faces to go into egypt to sojourn there they shall die by the sword by the famine and by the pestilence and none of them shall remain or escape from the evil that i will bring upon them
for thus saith the lord of hosts the god of israel as mine anger and my fury hath been poured forth upon the inhabitants of jerusalem so shall my fury be poured forth upon you when ye shall enter into egypt and ye shall be an execration and an astonishment and a curse and a reproach and ye shall see this place no more
the lord hath said concerning you o ye remnant of judah go ye not into egypt know certainly that i have admonished you this day
for ye dissembled in your hearts when ye sent me unto the lord your god saying pray for us unto the lord our god and according unto all that the lord our god shall say so declare unto us and we will do it
and now i have this day declared it to you but ye have not obeyed the voice of the lord your god nor any thing for the which he hath sent me unto you
now therefore know certainly that ye shall die by the sword by the famine and by the pestilence in the place whither ye desire to go and to sojourn
