 else i should tell himwell i faith i should
 when all's spent he ld be cross'd then an he could
 tis pity bounty had not eyes behind
 that man might ne'er be wretched for his mind
 exit
first lord where be our men
servant here my lord in readiness
second lord our horses
 reenter flavius with the casket
timon o my friends
 i have one word to say to you look you my good lord
 i must entreat you honour me so much
 as to advance this jewel accept it and wear it
 kind my lord
first lord i am so far already in your gifts
all so are we all
 enter a servant
servant my lord there are certain nobles of the senate
 newly alighted and come to visit you
timon they are fairly welcome
flavius i beseech your honour
 vouchsafe me a word it does concern you near
timon near why then another time i'll hear thee
 i prithee let's be provided to show them
 entertainment
flavius aside i scarce know how
 enter a second servant
second servant may it please your honour lord lucius
 out of his free love hath presented to you
 four milkwhite horses trapp'd in silver
timon i shall accept them fairly let the presents
 be worthily entertain'd
 enter a third servant
 how now what news
third servant please you my lord that honourable
 gentleman lord lucullus entreats your company
 tomorrow to hunt with him and has sent your honour
 two brace of greyhounds
timon i'll hunt with him and let them be received
 not without fair reward
flavius aside what will this come to
 he commands us to provide and give great gifts
 and all out of an empty coffer
 nor will he know his purse or yield me this
 to show him what a beggar his heart is
 being of no power to make his wishes good
 his promises fly so beyond his state
 that what he speaks is all in debt he owes
 for every word he is so kind that he now
 pays interest for t his land's put to their books
 well would i were gently put out of office
 before i were forced out
 happier is he that has no friend to feed
 than such that do e'en enemies exceed
 i bleed inwardly for my lord
 exit
timon you do yourselves
 much wrong you bate too much of your own merits
 here my lord a trifle of our love
second lord with more than common thanks i will receive it
third lord o he's the very soul of bounty
timon and now i remember my lord you gave
 good words the other day of a bay courser
 i rode on it is yours because you liked it
second lord o i beseech you pardon me my lord in that
timon you may take my word my lord i know no man
 can justly praise but what he does affect
 i weigh my friend's affection with mine own
 i'll tell you true i'll call to you
all lords o none so welcome
timon i take all and your several visitations
 so kind to heart tis not enough to give
 methinks i could deal kingdoms to my friends
 and ne'er be weary alcibiades
 thou art a soldier therefore seldom rich
 it comes in charity to thee for all thy living
 is mongst the dead and all the lands thou hast
 lie in a pitch'd field
alcibiades ay defiled land my lord
first lord we are so virtuously bound
timon and so
 am i to you
second lord so infinitely endear'd
timon all to you lights more lights
first lord the best of happiness
 honour and fortunes keep with you lord timon
timon ready for his friends
 exeunt all but apemantus and timon
apemantus what a coil's here
 serving of becks and juttingout of bums
 i doubt whether their legs be worth the sums
 that are given for em friendship's full of dregs
 methinks false hearts should never have sound legs
 thus honest fools lay out their wealth on court'sies
timon now apemantus if thou wert not sullen i would be
 good to thee
apemantus no i'll nothing for if i should be bribed too
 there would be none left to rail upon thee and then
 thou wouldst sin the faster thou givest so long
 timon i fear me thou wilt give away thyself in
 paper shortly what need these feasts pomps and
 vainglories
timon nay an you begin to rail on society once i am
 sworn not to give regard to you farewell and come
 with better music
 exit
apemantus so
 thou wilt not hear me now thou shalt not then
 i'll lock thy heaven from thee
 o that men's ears should be
 to counsel deaf but not to flattery
 exit
