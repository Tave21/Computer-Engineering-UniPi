 that touches caesar nearer read it great caesar
caesar what touches us ourself shall be last served
artemidorus delay not caesar read it instantly
caesar what is the fellow mad
publius sirrah give place
cassius what urge you your petitions in the street
 come to the capitol
 caesar goes up to the senatehouse the rest
 following
popilius i wish your enterprise today may thrive
cassius what enterprise popilius
popilius fare you well
 advances to caesar
brutus what said popilius lena
cassius he wish'd today our enterprise might thrive
 i fear our purpose is discovered
brutus look how he makes to caesar mark him
cassius casca be sudden for we fear prevention
 brutus what shall be done if this be known
 cassius or caesar never shall turn back
 for i will slay myself
brutus cassius be constant
 popilius lena speaks not of our purposes
 for look he smiles and caesar doth not change
cassius trebonius knows his time for look you brutus
 he draws mark antony out of the way
 exeunt antony and trebonius
decius brutus where is metellus cimber let him go
 and presently prefer his suit to caesar
brutus he is address'd press near and second him
cinna casca you are the first that rears your hand
caesar are we all ready what is now amiss
 that caesar and his senate must redress
metellus cimber most high most mighty and most puissant caesar
 metellus cimber throws before thy seat
 an humble heart
 kneeling
caesar i must prevent thee cimber
 these couchings and these lowly courtesies
 might fire the blood of ordinary men
 and turn preordinance and first decree
 into the law of children be not fond
 to think that caesar bears such rebel blood
 that will be thaw'd from the true quality
 with that which melteth fools i mean sweet words
 lowcrooked court'sies and base spanielfawning
 thy brother by decree is banished
 if thou dost bend and pray and fawn for him
 i spurn thee like a cur out of my way
 know caesar doth not wrong nor without cause
 will he be satisfied
metellus cimber is there no voice more worthy than my own
 to sound more sweetly in great caesar's ear
 for the repealing of my banish'd brother
brutus i kiss thy hand but not in flattery caesar
 desiring thee that publius cimber may
 have an immediate freedom of repeal
caesar what brutus
cassius pardon caesar caesar pardon
 as low as to thy foot doth cassius fall
 to beg enfranchisement for publius cimber
cassius i could be well moved if i were as you
 if i could pray to move prayers would move me
 but i am constant as the northern star
 of whose truefix'd and resting quality
 there is no fellow in the firmament
 the skies are painted with unnumber'd sparks
 they are all fire and every one doth shine
 but there's but one in all doth hold his place
 so in the world tis furnish'd well with men
 and men are flesh and blood and apprehensive
 yet in the number i do know but one
 that unassailable holds on his rank
 unshaked of motion and that i am he
 let me a little show it even in this
 that i was constant cimber should be banish'd
 and constant do remain to keep him so
cinna o caesar
caesar hence wilt thou lift up olympus
decius brutus great caesar
caesar doth not brutus bootless kneel
casca speak hands for me
 casca first then the other conspirators and
 brutus stab caesar
caesar et tu brute then fall caesar
 dies
cinna liberty freedom tyranny is dead
 run hence proclaim cry it about the streets
cassius some to the common pulpits and cry out
 liberty freedom and enfranchisement'
brutus people and senators be not affrighted
 fly not stand stiff ambition's debt is paid
casca go to the pulpit brutus
decius brutus and cassius too
brutus where's publius
cinna here quite confounded with this mutiny
metellus cimber stand fast together lest some friend of caesar's
 should chance
brutus talk not of standing publius good cheer
 there is no harm intended to your person
 nor to no roman else so tell them publius
cassius and leave us publius lest that the people
 rushing on us should do your age some mischief
brutus do so and let no man abide this deed
 but we the doers
 reenter trebonius
cassius where is antony
trebonius fled to his house amazed
 men wives and children stare cry out and run
 as it were doomsday
brutus fates we will know your pleasures
 that we shall die we know tis but the time
 and drawing days out that men stand upon
cassius why he that cuts off twenty years of life
 cuts off so many years of fearing death
brutus grant that and then is death a benefit
 so are we caesar's friends that have abridged
 his time of fearing death stoop romans stoop
 and let us bathe our hands in caesar's blood
 up to the elbows and besmear our swords
 then walk we forth even to the marketplace
 and waving our red weapons o'er our heads
 let's all cry peace freedom and liberty'
cassius stoop then and wash how many ages hence
 shall this our lofty scene be acted over
 in states unborn and accents yet unknown
brutus how many times shall caesar bleed in sport
 that now on pompey's basis lies along
 no worthier than the dust
cassius so oft as that shall be
 so often shall the knot of us be call'd
 the men that gave their country liberty
decius brutus what shall we forth
cassius ay every man away
 brutus shall lead and we will grace his heels
 with the most boldest and best hearts of rome
 enter a servant
brutus soft who comes here a friend of antony's
servant thus brutus did my master bid me kneel
 thus did mark antony bid me fall down
 and being prostrate thus he bade me say
 brutus is noble wise valiant and honest
 caesar was mighty bold royal and loving
 say i love brutus and i honour him
 say i fear'd caesar honour'd him and loved him
 if brutus will vouchsafe that antony
 may safely come to him and be resolved
 how caesar hath deserved to lie in death
 mark antony shall not love caesar dead
 so well as brutus living but will follow
 the fortunes and affairs of noble brutus
 thorough the hazards of this untrod state
 with all true faith so says my master antony
brutus thy master is a wise and valiant roman
 i never thought him worse
 tell him so please him come unto this place
 he shall be satisfied and by my honour
 depart untouch'd
servant i'll fetch him presently
 exit
brutus i know that we shall have him well to friend
cassius i wish we may but yet have i a mind
 that fears him much and my misgiving still
 falls shrewdly to the purpose
brutus but here comes antony
 reenter antony
 welcome mark antony
antony o mighty caesar dost thou lie so low
 are all thy conquests glories triumphs spoils
 shrunk to this little measure fare thee well
 i know not gentlemen what you intend
 who else must be let blood who else is rank
 if i myself there is no hour so fit
 as caesar's death hour nor no instrument
 of half that worth as those your swords made rich
 with the most noble blood of all this world
 i do beseech ye if you bear me hard
 now whilst your purpled hands do reek and smoke
 fulfil your pleasure live a thousand years
 i shall not find myself so apt to die
 no place will please me so no mean of death
 as here by caesar and by you cut off
 the choice and master spirits of this age
brutus o antony beg not your death of us
 though now we must appear bloody and cruel
 as by our hands and this our present act
 you see we do yet see you but our hands
 and this the bleeding business they have done
 our hearts you see not they are pitiful
 and pity to the general wrong of rome
 as fire drives out fire so pity pity
 hath done this deed on caesar for your part
 to you our swords have leaden points mark antony
 our arms in strength of malice and our hearts
 of brothers temper do receive you in
 with all kind love good thoughts and reverence
cassius your voice shall be as strong as any man's
 in the disposing of new dignities
brutus only be patient till we have appeased
 the multitude beside themselves with fear
