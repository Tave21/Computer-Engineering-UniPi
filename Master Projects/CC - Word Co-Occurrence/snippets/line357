now which way shall she turn what shall she say
her words are done her woes are more increasing
the time is spent her object will away
and from her twining arms doth urge releasing
'pity she cries some favour some remorse'
away he springs and hasteth to his horse
but lo from forth a copse that neighbors by
a breeding jennet lusty young and proud
adonis trampling courser doth espy
and forth she rushes snorts and neighs aloud
the strongneck'd steed being tied unto a tree
breaketh his rein and to her straight goes he
imperiously he leaps he neighs he bounds
and now his woven girths he breaks asunder
the bearing earth with his hard hoof he wounds
whose hollow womb resounds like heaven's thunder
the iron bit he crusheth tween his teeth
controlling what he was controlled with
his ears upprick'd his braided hanging mane
upon his compass'd crest now stand on end
his nostrils drink the air and forth again
as from a furnace vapours doth he send
his eye which scornfully glisters like fire
shows his hot courage and his high desire
sometime he trots as if he told the steps
with gentle majesty and modest pride
anon he rears upright curvets and leaps
as who should say lo thus my strength is tried
and this i do to captivate the eye
of the fair breeder that is standing by'
what recketh he his rider's angry stir
his flattering holla or his stand i say'
what cares he now for curb or pricking spur
for rich caparisons or trapping gay
he sees his love and nothing else he sees
for nothing else with his proud sight agrees
look when a painter would surpass the life
in limning out a wellproportion'd steed
his art with nature's workmanship at strife
as if the dead the living should exceed
so did this horse excel a common one
in shape in courage colour pace and bone
roundhoof'd shortjointed fetlocks shag and long
broad breast full eye small head and nostril wide
high crest short ears straight legs and passing strong
thin mane thick tail broad buttock tender hide
look what a horse should have he did not lack
save a proud rider on so proud a back
sometime he scuds far off and there he stares
anon he starts at stirring of a feather
to bid the wind a base he now prepares
and whether he run or fly they know not whether
for through his mane and tail the high wind sings
fanning the hairs who wave like feather'd wings
he looks upon his love and neighs unto her
she answers him as if she knew his mind
being proud as females are to see him woo her
she puts on outward strangeness seems unkind
spurns at his love and scorns the heat he feels
beating his kind embracements with her heels
then like a melancholy malcontent
he veils his tail that like a falling plume
cool shadow to his melting buttock lent
he stamps and bites the poor flies in his fume
his love perceiving how he is enraged
grew kinder and his fury was assuaged
his testy master goeth about to take him
when lo the unback'd breeder full of fear
jealous of catching swiftly doth forsake him
with her the horse and left adonis there
as they were mad unto the wood they hie them
outstripping crows that strive to overfly them
all swoln with chafing down adonis sits
banning his boisterous and unruly beast
and now the happy season once more fits
that lovesick love by pleading may be blest
for lovers say the heart hath treble wrong
when it is barr'd the aidance of the tongue
an oven that is stopp'd or river stay'd
burneth more hotly swelleth with more rage
so of concealed sorrow may be said
free vent of words love's fire doth assuage
but when the heart's attorney once is mute
the client breaks as desperate in his suit
he sees her coming and begins to glow
even as a dying coal revives with wind
and with his bonnet hides his angry brow
looks on the dull earth with disturbed mind
taking no notice that she is so nigh
for all askance he holds her in his eye
o what a sight it was wistly to view
how she came stealing to the wayward boy
to note the fighting conflict of her hue
how white and red each other did destroy
but now her cheek was pale and by and by
it flash'd forth fire as lightning from the sky
now was she just before him as he sat
and like a lowly lover down she kneels
with one fair hand she heaveth up his hat
her other tender hand his fair cheek feels
his tenderer cheek receives her soft hand's print
as apt as newfall'n snow takes any dint
o what a war of looks was then between them
her eyes petitioners to his eyes suing
his eyes saw her eyes as they had not seen them
her eyes woo'd still his eyes disdain'd the wooing
and all this dumb play had his acts made plain
with tears which choruslike her eyes did rain
full gently now she takes him by the hand
a lily prison'd in a gaol of snow
or ivory in an alabaster band
so white a friend engirts so white a foe
this beauteous combat wilful and unwilling
show'd like two silver doves that sit abilling
once more the engine of her thoughts began
'o fairest mover on this mortal round
would thou wert as i am and i a man
my heart all whole as thine thy heart my wound
for one sweet look thy help i would assure thee
though nothing but my body's bane would cure thee
'give me my hand saith he why dost thou feel it'
'give me my heart saith she and thou shalt have it
o give it me lest thy hard heart do steel it
and being steel'd soft sighs can never grave it
then love's deep groans i never shall regard
because adonis heart hath made mine hard'
'for shame he cries let go and let me go
my day's delight is past my horse is gone
and tis your fault i am bereft him so
i pray you hence and leave me here alone
for all my mind my thought my busy care
is how to get my palfrey from the mare'
thus she replies thy palfrey as he should
welcomes the warm approach of sweet desire
affection is a coal that must be cool'd
else suffer'd it will set the heart on fire
the sea hath bounds but deep desire hath none
therefore no marvel though thy horse be gone
'how like a jade he stood tied to the tree
servilely master'd with a leathern rein
but when he saw his love his youth's fair fee
he held such petty bondage in disdain
throwing the base thong from his bending crest
enfranchising his mouth his back his breast
'who sees his truelove in her naked bed
teaching the sheets a whiter hue than white
but when his glutton eye so full hath fed
his other agents aim at like delight
who is so faint that dare not be so bold
to touch the fire the weather being cold
'let me excuse thy courser gentle boy
and learn of him i heartily beseech thee
to take advantage on presented joy
though i were dumb yet his proceedings teach thee
o learn to love the lesson is but plain
and once made perfect never lost again'
i know not love quoth he nor will not know it
unless it be a boar and then i chase it
'tis much to borrow and i will not owe it
my love to love is love but to disgrace it
for i have heard it is a life in death
that laughs and weeps and all but with a breath
'who wears a garment shapeless and unfinish'd
who plucks the bud before one leaf put forth
if springing things be any jot diminish'd
they wither in their prime prove nothing worth
the colt that's back'd and burden'd being young
loseth his pride and never waxeth strong
'you hurt my hand with wringing let us part
and leave this idle theme this bootless chat
remove your siege from my unyielding heart
to love's alarms it will not ope the gate
dismiss your vows your feigned tears your flattery
for where a heart is hard they make no battery'
'what canst thou talk quoth she hast thou a tongue
o would thou hadst not or i had no hearing
thy mermaid's voice hath done me double wrong
i had my load before now press'd with bearing
melodious discord heavenly tune harshsounding
ear's deepsweet music and heart's deepsore wounding
'had i no eyes but ears my ears would love
that inward beauty and invisible
or were i deaf thy outward parts would move
each part in me that were but sensible
though neither eyes nor ears to hear nor see
yet should i be in love by touching thee
'say that the sense of feeling were bereft me
and that i could not see nor hear nor touch
and nothing but the very smell were left me
yet would my love to thee be still as much
for from the stillitory of thy face excelling
comes breath perfumed that breedeth love by
smelling
'but o what banquet wert thou to the taste
being nurse and feeder of the other four
would they not wish the feast might ever last
and bid suspicion doublelock the door
lest jealousy that sour unwelcome guest
should by his stealing in disturb the feast'
once more the rubycolour'd portal open'd
