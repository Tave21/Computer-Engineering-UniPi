duke solinus she is a virtuous and a reverend lady
 it cannot be that she hath done thee wrong
adriana may it please your grace antipholus my husband
 whom i made lord of me and all i had
 at your important lettersthis ill day
 a most outrageous fit of madness took him
 that desperately he hurried through the street
 with him his bondman all as mad as he
 doing displeasure to the citizens
 by rushing in their houses bearing thence
 rings jewels any thing his rage did like
 once did i get him bound and sent him home
 whilst to take order for the wrongs i went
 that here and there his fury had committed
 anon i wot not by what strong escape
 he broke from those that had the guard of him
 and with his mad attendant and himself
 each one with ireful passion with drawn swords
 met us again and madly bent on us
 chased us away till raising of more aid
 we came again to bind them then they fled
 into this abbey whither we pursued them
 and here the abbess shuts the gates on us
 and will not suffer us to fetch him out
 nor send him forth that we may bear him hence
 therefore most gracious duke with thy command
 let him be brought forth and borne hence for help
duke solinus long since thy husband served me in my wars
 and i to thee engaged a prince's word
 when thou didst make him master of thy bed
 to do him all the grace and good i could
 go some of you knock at the abbeygate
 and bid the lady abbess come to me
 i will determine this before i stir
 enter a servant
servant o mistress mistress shift and save yourself
 my master and his man are both broke loose
 beaten the maids arow and bound the doctor
 whose beard they have singed off with brands of fire
 and ever as it blazed they threw on him
 great pails of puddled mire to quench the hair
 my master preaches patience to him and the while
 his man with scissors nicks him like a fool
 and sure unless you send some present help
 between them they will kill the conjurer
adriana peace fool thy master and his man are here
 and that is false thou dost report to us
servant mistress upon my life i tell you true
 i have not breathed almost since i did see it
 he cries for you and vows if he can take you
 to scorch your face and to disfigure you
 cry within
 hark hark i hear him mistress fly be gone
duke solinus come stand by me fear nothing guard with halberds
adriana ay me it is my husband witness you
 that he is borne about invisible
 even now we housed him in the abbey here
 and now he's there past thought of human reason
 enter antipholus of ephesus and dromio of ephesus
antipholus
of ephesus justice most gracious duke o grant me justice
 even for the service that long since i did thee
 when i bestrid thee in the wars and took
 deep scars to save thy life even for the blood
 that then i lost for thee now grant me justice
aegeon unless the fear of death doth make me dote
 i see my son antipholus and dromio
antipholus
of ephesus justice sweet prince against that woman there
 she whom thou gavest to me to be my wife
 that hath abused and dishonour'd me
 even in the strength and height of injury
 beyond imagination is the wrong
 that she this day hath shameless thrown on me
duke solinus discover how and thou shalt find me just
antipholus
of ephesus this day great duke she shut the doors upon me
 while she with harlots feasted in my house
duke solinus a grievous fault say woman didst thou so
adriana no my good lord myself he and my sister
 today did dine together so befall my soul
 as this is false he burdens me withal
luciana ne'er may i look on day nor sleep on night
 but she tells to your highness simple truth
angelo o perjured woman they are both forsworn
 in this the madman justly chargeth them
antipholus
of ephesus my liege i am advised what i say
 neither disturbed with the effect of wine
 nor headyrash provoked with raging ire
 albeit my wrongs might make one wiser mad
 this woman lock'd me out this day from dinner
 that goldsmith there were he not pack'd with her
 could witness it for he was with me then
 who parted with me to go fetch a chain
 promising to bring it to the porpentine
 where balthazar and i did dine together
 our dinner done and he not coming thither
 i went to seek him in the street i met him
 and in his company that gentleman
 there did this perjured goldsmith swear me down
 that i this day of him received the chain
 which god he knows i saw not for the which
 he did arrest me with an officer
 i did obey and sent my peasant home
 for certain ducats he with none return'd
 then fairly i bespoke the officer
 to go in person with me to my house
 by the way we met
 my wife her sister and a rabble more
 of vile confederates along with them
 they brought one pinch a hungry leanfaced villain
 a mere anatomy a mountebank
 a threadbare juggler and a fortuneteller
 a needy holloweyed sharplooking wretch
 a deadlooking man this pernicious slave
 forsooth took on him as a conjurer
 and gazing in mine eyes feeling my pulse
 and with no face as twere outfacing me
 cries out i was possess'd then all together
 they fell upon me bound me bore me thence
 and in a dark and dankish vault at home
 there left me and my man both bound together
 till gnawing with my teeth my bonds in sunder
 i gain'd my freedom and immediately
 ran hither to your grace whom i beseech
 to give me ample satisfaction
 for these deep shames and great indignities
angelo my lord in truth thus far i witness with him
 that he dined not at home but was lock'd out
duke solinus but had he such a chain of thee or no
angelo he had my lord and when he ran in here
 these people saw the chain about his neck
second merchant besides i will be sworn these ears of mine
 heard you confess you had the chain of him
 after you first forswore it on the mart
 and thereupon i drew my sword on you
 and then you fled into this abbey here
 from whence i think you are come by miracle
antipholus
of ephesus i never came within these abbeywalls
 nor ever didst thou draw thy sword on me
 i never saw the chain so help me heaven
 and this is false you burden me withal
duke solinus why what an intricate impeach is this
 i think you all have drunk of circe's cup
 if here you housed him here he would have been
 if he were mad he would not plead so coldly
 you say he dined at home the goldsmith here
 denies that saying sirrah what say you
dromio of ephesus sir he dined with her there at the porpentine
courtezan he did and from my finger snatch'd that ring
antipholus
of ephesus tis true my liege this ring i had of her
duke solinus saw'st thou him enter at the abbey here
courtezan as sure my liege as i do see your grace
duke solinus why this is strange go call the abbess hither
 i think you are all mated or stark mad
 exit one to abbess
aegeon most mighty duke vouchsafe me speak a word
 haply i see a friend will save my life
 and pay the sum that may deliver me
duke solinus speak freely syracusian what thou wilt
aegeon is not your name sir call'd antipholus
 and is not that your bondman dromio
dromio of ephesus within this hour i was his bondman sir
 but he i thank him gnaw'd in two my cords
 now am i dromio and his man unbound
aegeon i am sure you both of you remember me
dromio of ephesus ourselves we do remember sir by you
 for lately we were bound as you are now
 you are not pinch's patient are you sir
aegeon why look you strange on me you know me well
antipholus i never saw you in my life till now
aegeon o grief hath changed me since you saw me last
 and careful hours with time's deformed hand
 have written strange defeatures in my face
 but tell me yet dost thou not know my voice
antipholus
of ephesus neither
aegeon dromio nor thou
dromio of ephesus no trust me sir nor i
aegeon i am sure thou dost
dromio of ephesus ay sir but i am sure i do not and whatsoever a
 man denies you are now bound to believe him
aegeon not know my voice o time's extremity
 hast thou so crack'd and splitted my poor tongue
 in seven short years that here my only son
 knows not my feeble key of untuned cares
 though now this grained face of mine be hid
 in sapconsuming winter's drizzled snow
 and all the conduits of my blood froze up
 yet hath my night of life some memory
 my wasting lamps some fading glimmer left
 my dull deaf ears a little use to hear
 all these old witnessesi cannot err
 tell me thou art my son antipholus
antipholus
of ephesus i never saw my father in my life
aegeon but seven years since in syracusa boy
