2ki322 and they rose up early in the morning and the sun shone upon the water and the moabites saw the water on the other side as red as blood
2ki323 and they said this is blood the kings are surely slain and they have smitten one another now therefore moab to the spoil
2ki324 and when they came to the camp of israel the israelites rose up and smote the moabites so that they fled before them but they went forward smiting the moabites even in their country
2ki325 and they beat down the cities and on every good piece of land cast every man his stone and filled it and they stopped all the wells of water and felled all the good trees only in kirharaseth left they the stones thereof howbeit the slingers went about it and smote it
2ki326 and when the king of moab saw that the battle was too sore for him he took with him seven hundred men that drew swords to break through even unto the king of edom but they could not
2ki327 then he took his eldest son that should have reigned in his stead and offered him for a burnt offering upon the wall and there was great indignation against israel and they departed from him and returned to their own land
2ki41 now there cried a certain woman of the wives of the sons of the prophets unto elisha saying thy servant my husband is dead and thou knowest that thy servant did fear the lord and the creditor is come to take unto him my two sons to be bondmen
2ki42 and elisha said unto her what shall i do for thee tell me what hast thou in the house and she said thine handmaid hath not any thing in the house save a pot of oil
2ki43 then he said go borrow thee vessels abroad of all thy neighbours even empty vessels borrow not a few
2ki44 and when thou art come in thou shalt shut the door upon thee and upon thy sons and shalt pour out into all those vessels and thou shalt set aside that which is full
2ki45 so she went from him and shut the door upon her and upon her sons who brought the vessels to her and she poured out
2ki46 and it came to pass when the vessels were full that she said unto her son bring me yet a vessel and he said unto her there is not a vessel more and the oil stayed
2ki47 then she came and told the man of god and he said go sell the oil and pay thy debt and live thou and thy children of the rest
2ki48 and it fell on a day that elisha passed to shunem where was a great woman and she constrained him to eat bread and so it was that as oft as he passed by he turned in thither to eat bread
2ki49 and she said unto her husband behold now i perceive that this is an holy man of god which passeth by us continually
2ki410 let us make a little chamber i pray thee on the wall and let us set for him there a bed and a table and a stool and a candlestick and it shall be when he cometh to us that he shall turn in thither
2ki411 and it fell on a day that he came thither and he turned into the chamber and lay there
2ki412 and he said to gehazi his servant call this shunammite and when he had called her she stood before him
2ki413 and he said unto him say now unto her behold thou hast been careful for us with all this care what is to be done for thee wouldest thou be spoken for to the king or to the captain of the host and she answered i dwell among mine own people
2ki414 and he said what then is to be done for her and gehazi answered verily she hath no child and her husband is old
2ki415 and he said call her and when he had called her she stood in the door
2ki416 and he said about this season according to the time of life thou shalt embrace a son and she said nay my lord thou man of god do not lie unto thine handmaid
2ki417 and the woman conceived and bare a son at that season that elisha had said unto her according to the time of life
2ki418 and when the child was grown it fell on a day that he went out to his father to the reapers
2ki419 and he said unto his father my head my head and he said to a lad carry him to his mother
2ki420 and when he had taken him and brought him to his mother he sat on her knees till noon and then died
2ki421 and she went up and laid him on the bed of the man of god and shut the door upon him and went out
2ki422 and she called unto her husband and said send me i pray thee one of the young men and one of the asses that i may run to the man of god and come again
2ki423 and he said wherefore wilt thou go to him to day it is neither new moon nor sabbath and she said it shall be well
2ki424 then she saddled an ass and said to her servant drive and go forward slack not thy riding for me except i bid thee
2ki425 so she went and came unto the man of god to mount carmel and it came to pass when the man of god saw her afar off that he said to gehazi his servant behold yonder is that shunammite
2ki426 run now i pray thee to meet her and say unto her is it well with thee is it well with thy husband is it well with the child and she answered it is well
2ki427 and when she came to the man of god to the hill she caught him by the feet but gehazi came near to thrust her away and the man of god said let her alone for her soul is vexed within her and the lord hath hid it from me and hath not told me
2ki428 then she said did i desire a son of my lord did i not say do not deceive me
2ki429 then he said to gehazi gird up thy loins and take my staff in thine hand and go thy way if thou meet any man salute him not and if any salute thee answer him not again and lay my staff upon the face of the child
2ki430 and the mother of the child said as the lord liveth and as thy soul liveth i will not leave thee and he arose and followed her
2ki431 and gehazi passed on before them and laid the staff upon the face of the child but there was neither voice nor hearing wherefore he went again to meet him and told him saying the child is not awaked
2ki432 and when elisha was come into the house behold the child was dead and laid upon his bed
2ki433 he went in therefore and shut the door upon them twain and prayed unto the lord
2ki434 and he went up and lay upon the child and put his mouth upon his mouth and his eyes upon his eyes and his hands upon his hands and he stretched himself upon the child and the flesh of the child waxed warm
2ki435 then he returned and walked in the house to and fro and went up and stretched himself upon him and the child sneezed seven times and the child opened his eyes
2ki436 and he called gehazi and said call this shunammite so he called her and when she was come in unto him he said take up thy son
2ki437 then she went in and fell at his feet and bowed herself to the ground and took up her son and went out
2ki438 and elisha came again to gilgal and there was a dearth in the land and the sons of the prophets were sitting before him and he said unto his servant set on the great pot and seethe pottage for the sons of the prophets
2ki439 and one went out into the field to gather herbs and found a wild vine and gathered thereof wild gourds his lap full and came and shred them into the pot of pottage for they knew them not
2ki440 so they poured out for the men to eat and it came to pass as they were eating of the pottage that they cried out and said o thou man of god there is death in the pot and they could not eat thereof
2ki441 but he said then bring meal and he cast it into the pot and he said pour out for the people that they may eat and there was no harm in the pot
2ki442 and there came a man from baalshalisha and brought the man of god bread of the firstfruits twenty loaves of barley and full ears of corn in the husk thereof and he said give unto the people that they may eat
2ki443 and his servitor said what should i set this before an hundred men he said again give the people that they may eat for thus saith the lord they shall eat and shall leave thereof
2ki444 so he set it before them and they did eat and left thereof according to the word of the lord
2ki51 now naaman captain of the host of the king of syria was a great man with his master and honourable because by him the lord had given deliverance unto syria he was also a mighty man in valour but he was a leper
2ki52 and the syrians had gone out by companies and had brought away captive out of the land of israel a little maid and she waited on naaman's wife
2ki53 and she said unto her mistress would god my lord were with the prophet that is in samaria for he would recover him of his leprosy
2ki54 and one went in and told his lord saying thus and thus said the maid that is of the land of israel
2ki55 and the king of syria said go to go and i will send a letter unto the king of israel and he departed and took with him ten talents of silver and six thousand pieces of gold and ten changes of raiment
2ki56 and he brought the letter to the king of israel saying now when this letter is come unto thee behold i have therewith sent naaman my servant to thee that thou mayest recover him of his leprosy
2ki57 and it came to pass when the king of israel had read the letter that he rent his clothes and said am i god to kill and to make alive that this man doth send unto me to recover a man of his leprosy wherefore consider i pray you and see how he seeketh a quarrel against me
2ki58 and it was so when elisha the man of god had heard that the king of israel had rent his clothes that he sent to the king saying wherefore hast thou rent thy clothes let him come now to me and he shall know that there is a prophet in israel
2ki59 so naaman came with his horses and with his chariot and stood at the door of the house of elisha
2ki510 and elisha sent a messenger unto him saying go and wash in jordan seven times and thy flesh shall come again to thee and thou shalt be clean
2ki511 but naaman was wroth and went away and said behold i thought he will surely come out to me and stand and call on the name of the lord his god and strike his hand over the place and recover the leper
2ki512 are not abana and pharpar rivers of damascus better than all the waters of israel may i not wash in them and be clean so he turned and went away in a rage
2ki513 and his servants came near and spake unto him and said my father if the prophet had bid thee do some great thing wouldest thou not have done it how much rather then when he saith to thee wash and be clean
2ki514 then went he down and dipped himself seven times in jordan according to the saying of the man of god and his flesh came again like unto the flesh of a little child and he was clean
2ki515 and he returned to the man of god he and all his company and came and stood before him and he said behold now i know that there is no god in all the earth but in israel now therefore i pray thee take a blessing of thy servant
2ki516 but he said as the lord liveth before whom i stand i will receive none and he urged him to take it but he refused
2ki517 and naaman said shall there not then i pray thee be given to thy servant two mules burden of earth for thy servant will henceforth offer neither burnt offering nor sacrifice unto other gods but unto the lord
2ki518 in this thing the lord pardon thy servant that when my master goeth into the house of rimmon to worship there and he leaneth on my hand and i bow myself in the house of rimmon when i bow down myself in the house of rimmon the lord pardon thy servant in this thing
2ki519 and he said unto him go in peace so he departed from him a little way
2ki520 but gehazi the servant of elisha the man of god said behold my master hath spared naaman this syrian in not receiving at his hands that which he brought but as the lord liveth i will run after him and take somewhat of him
2ki521 so gehazi followed after naaman and when naaman saw him running after him he lighted down from the chariot to meet him and said is all well
2ki522 and he said all is well my master hath sent me saying behold even now there be come to me from mount ephraim two young men of the sons of the prophets give them i pray thee a talent of silver and two changes of garments
2ki523 and naaman said be content take two talents and he urged him and bound two talents of silver in two bags with two changes of garments and laid them upon two of his servants and they bare them before him
2ki524 and when he came to the tower he took them from their hand and bestowed them in the house and he let the men go and they departed
2ki525 but he went in and stood before his master and elisha said unto him whence comest thou gehazi and he said thy servant went no whither
2ki526 and he said unto him went not mine heart with thee when the man turned again from his chariot to meet thee is it a time to receive money and to receive garments and oliveyards and vineyards and sheep and oxen and menservants and maidservants
2ki527 the leprosy therefore of naaman shall cleave unto thee and unto thy seed for ever and he went out from his presence a leper as white as snow
2ki61 and the sons of the prophets said unto elisha behold now the place where we dwell with thee is too strait for us
2ki62 let us go we pray thee unto jordan and take thence every man a beam and let us make us a place there where we may dwell and he answered go ye
2ki63 and one said be content i pray thee and go with thy servants and he answered i will go
2ki64 so he went with them and when they came to jordan they cut down wood
2ki65 but as one was felling a beam the axe head fell into the water and he cried and said alas master for it was borrowed
2ki66 and the man of god said where fell it and he shewed him the place and he cut down a stick and cast it in thither and the iron did swim
2ki67 therefore said he take it up to thee and he put out his hand and took it
2ki68 then the king of syria warred against israel and took counsel with his servants saying in such and such a place shall be my camp
2ki69 and the man of god sent unto the king of israel saying beware that thou pass not such a place for thither the syrians are come down
2ki610 and the king of israel sent to the place which the man of god told him and warned him of and saved himself there not once nor twice
2ki611 therefore the heart of the king of syria was sore troubled for this thing and he called his servants and said unto them will ye not shew me which of us is for the king of israel
2ki612 and one of his servants said none my lord o king but elisha the prophet that is in israel telleth the king of israel the words that thou speakest in thy bedchamber
2ki613 and he said go and spy where he is that i may send and fetch him and it was told him saying behold he is in dothan
2ki614 therefore sent he thither horses and chariots and a great host and they came by night and compassed the city about
2ki615 and when the servant of the man of god was risen early and gone forth behold an host compassed the city both with horses and chariots and his servant said unto him alas my master how shall we do
2ki616 and he answered fear not for they that be with us are more than they that be with them
2ki617 and elisha prayed and said lord i pray thee open his eyes that he may see and the lord opened the eyes of the young man and he saw and behold the mountain was full of horses and chariots of fire round about elisha
2ki618 and when they came down to him elisha prayed unto the lord and said smite this people i pray thee with blindness and he smote them with blindness according to the word of elisha
2ki619 and elisha said unto them this is not the way neither is this the city follow me and i will bring you to the man whom ye seek but he led them to samaria
2ki620 and it came to pass when they were come into samaria that elisha said lord open the eyes of these men that they may see and the lord opened their eyes and they saw and behold they were in the midst of samaria
2ki621 and the king of israel said unto elisha when he saw them my father shall i smite them shall i smite them
2ki622 and he answered thou shalt not smite them wouldest thou smite those whom thou hast taken captive with thy sword and with thy bow set bread and water before them that they may eat and drink and go to their master
2ki623 and he prepared great provision for them and when they had eaten and drunk he sent them away and they went to their master so the bands of syria came no more into the land of israel
2ki624 and it came to pass after this that benhadad king of syria gathered all his host and went up and besieged samaria
2ki625 and there was a great famine in samaria and behold they besieged it until an ass's head was sold for fourscore pieces of silver and the fourth part of a cab of dove's dung for five pieces of silver
2ki626 and as the king of israel was passing by upon the wall there cried a woman unto him saying help my lord o king
2ki627 and he said if the lord do not help thee whence shall i help thee out of the barnfloor or out of the winepress
2ki628 and the king said unto her what aileth thee and she answered this woman said unto me give thy son that we may eat him to day and we will eat my son to morrow
2ki629 so we boiled my son and did eat him and i said unto her on the next day give thy son that we may eat him and she hath hid her son
2ki630 and it came to pass when the king heard the words of the woman that he rent his clothes and he passed by upon the wall and the people looked and behold he had sackcloth within upon his flesh
2ki631 then he said god do so and more also to me if the head of elisha the son of shaphat shall stand on him this day
2ki632 but elisha sat in his house and the elders sat with him and the king sent a man from before him but ere the messenger came to him he said to the elders see ye how this son of a murderer hath sent to take away mine head look when the messenger cometh shut the door and hold him fast at the door is not the sound of his master's feet behind him
2ki633 and while he yet talked with them behold the messenger came down unto him and he said behold this evil is of the lord what should i wait for the lord any longer
2ki71 then elisha said hear ye the word of the lord thus saith the lord to morrow about this time shall a measure of fine flour be sold for a shekel and two measures of barley for a shekel in the gate of samaria
2ki72 then a lord on whose hand the king leaned answered the man of god and said behold if the lord would make windows in heaven might this thing be and he said behold thou shalt see it with thine eyes but shalt not eat thereof
2ki73 and there were four leprous men at the entering in of the gate and they said one to another why sit we here until we die
2ki74 if we say we will enter into the city then the famine is in the city and we shall die there and if we sit still here we die also now therefore come and let us fall unto the host of the syrians if they save us alive we shall live and if they kill us we shall but die
2ki75 and they rose up in the twilight to go unto the camp of the syrians and when they were come to the uttermost part of the camp of syria behold there was no man there
2ki76 for the lord had made the host of the syrians to hear a noise of chariots and a noise of horses even the noise of a great host and they said one to another lo the king of israel hath hired against us the kings of the hittites and the kings of the egyptians to come upon us
2ki77 wherefore they arose and fled in the twilight and left their tents and their horses and their asses even the camp as it was and fled for their life
2ki78 and when these lepers came to the uttermost part of the camp they went into one tent and did eat and drink and carried thence silver and gold and raiment and went and hid it and came again and entered into another tent and carried thence also and went and hid it
2ki79 then they said one to another we do not well this day is a day of good tidings and we hold our peace if we tarry till the morning light some mischief will come upon us now therefore come that we may go and tell the king's household
2ki710 so they came and called unto the porter of the city and they told them saying we came to the camp of the syrians and behold there was no man there neither voice of man but horses tied and asses tied and the tents as they were
2ki711 and he called the porters and they told it to the king's house within
2ki712 and the king arose in the night and said unto his servants i will now shew you what the syrians have done to us they know that we be hungry therefore are they gone out of the camp to hide themselves in the field saying when they come out of the city we shall catch them alive and get into the city
2ki713 and one of his servants answered and said let some take i pray thee five of the horses that remain which are left in the city behold they are as all the multitude of israel that are left in it behold i say they are even as all the multitude of the israelites that are consumed and let us send and see
2ki714 they took therefore two chariot horses and the king sent after the host of the syrians saying go and see
2ki715 and they went after them unto jordan and lo all the way was full of garments and vessels which the syrians had cast away in their haste and the messengers returned and told the king
2ki716 and the people went out and spoiled the tents of the syrians so a measure of fine flour was sold for a shekel and two measures of barley for a shekel according to the word of the lord
2ki717 and the king appointed the lord on whose hand he leaned to have the charge of the gate and the people trode upon him in the gate and he died as the man of god had said who spake when the king came down to him
2ki718 and it came to pass as the man of god had spoken to the king saying two measures of barley for a shekel and a measure of fine flour for a shekel shall be to morrow about this time in the gate of samaria
2ki719 and that lord answered the man of god and said now behold if the lord should make windows in heaven might such a thing be and he said behold thou shalt see it with thine eyes but shalt not eat thereof
2ki720 and so it fell out unto him for the people trode upon him in the gate and he died
2ki81 then spake elisha unto the woman whose son he had restored to life saying arise and go thou and thine household and sojourn wheresoever thou canst sojourn for the lord hath called for a famine and it shall also come upon the land seven years
2ki82 and the woman arose and did after the saying of the man of god and she went with her household and sojourned in the land of the philistines seven years
2ki83 and it came to pass at the seven years end that the woman returned out of the land of the philistines and she went forth to cry unto the king for her house and for her land
2ki84 and the king talked with gehazi the servant of the man of god saying tell me i pray thee all the great things that elisha hath done
2ki85 and it came to pass as he was telling the king how he had restored a dead body to life that behold the woman whose son he had restored to life cried to the king for her house and for her land and gehazi said my lord o king this is the woman and this is her son whom elisha restored to life
2ki86 and when the king asked the woman she told him so the king appointed unto her a certain officer saying restore all that was hers and all the fruits of the field since the day that she left the land even until now
2ki87 and elisha came to damascus and benhadad the king of syria was sick and it was told him saying the man of god is come hither
2ki88 and the king said unto hazael take a present in thine hand and go meet the man of god and enquire of the lord by him saying shall i recover of this disease
2ki89 so hazael went to meet him and took a present with him even of every good thing of damascus forty camels burden and came and stood before him and said thy son benhadad king of syria hath sent me to thee saying shall i recover of this disease
2ki810 and elisha said unto him go say unto him thou mayest certainly recover howbeit the lord hath shewed me that he shall surely die
2ki811 and he settled his countenance stedfastly until he was ashamed and the man of god wept
2ki812 and hazael said why weepeth my lord and he answered because i know the evil that thou wilt do unto the children of israel their strong holds wilt thou set on fire and their young men wilt thou slay with the sword and wilt dash their children and rip up their women with child
2ki813 and hazael said but what is thy servant a dog that he should do this great thing and elisha answered the lord hath shewed me that thou shalt be king over syria
2ki814 so he departed from elisha and came to his master who said to him what said elisha to thee and he answered he told me that thou shouldest surely recover
2ki815 and it came to pass on the morrow that he took a thick cloth and dipped it in water and spread it on his face so that he died and hazael reigned in his stead
2ki816 and in the fifth year of joram the son of ahab king of israel jehoshaphat being then king of judah jehoram the son of je hoshaphat king of judah began to reign
2ki817 thirty and two years old was he when he began to reign and he reigned eight years in jerusalem
2ki818 and he walked in the way of the kings of israel as did the house of ahab for the daughter of ahab was his wife and he did evil in the sight of the lord
2ki819 yet the lord would not destroy judah for david his servant's sake as he promised him to give him alway a light and to his children
2ki820 in his days edom revolted from under the hand of judah and made a king over themselves
2ki821 so joram went over to zair and all the chariots with him and he rose by night and smote the edomites which compassed him about and the captains of the chariots and the people fled into their tents
2ki822 yet edom revolted from under the hand of judah unto this day then libnah revolted at the same time
2ki823 and the rest of the acts of joram and all that he did are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of judah
2ki824 and joram slept with his fathers and was buried with his fathers in the city of david and ahaziah his son reigned in his stead
2ki825 in the twelfth year of joram the son of ahab king of israel did ahaziah the son of jehoram king of judah begin to reign
2ki826 two and twenty years old was ahaziah when he began to reign and he reigned one year in jerusalem and his mother's name was athaliah the daughter of omri king of israel
2ki827 and he walked in the way of the house of ahab and did evil in the sight of the lord as did the house of ahab for he was the son in law of the house of ahab
2ki828 and he went with joram the son of ahab to the war against hazael king of syria in ramothgilead and the syrians wounded joram
2ki829 and king joram went back to be healed in jezreel of the wounds which the syrians had given him at ramah when he fought against hazael king of syria and ahaziah the son of jehoram king of judah went down to see joram the son of ahab in jezreel because he was sick
2ki91 and elisha the prophet called one of the children of the prophets and said unto him gird up thy loins and take this box of oil in thine hand and go to ramothgilead
2ki92 and when thou comest thither look out there jehu the son of jehoshaphat the son of nimshi and go in and make him arise up from among his brethren and carry him to an inner chamber
2ki93 then take the box of oil and pour it on his head and say thus saith the lord i have anointed thee king over israel then open the door and flee and tarry not
2ki94 so the young man even the young man the prophet went to ramothgilead
2ki95 and when he came behold the captains of the host were sitting and he said i have an errand to thee o captain and jehu said unto which of all us and he said to thee o captain
2ki96 and he arose and went into the house and he poured the oil on his head and said unto him thus saith the lord god of israel i have anointed thee king over the people of the lord even over israel
2ki97 and thou shalt smite the house of ahab thy master that i may avenge the blood of my servants the prophets and the blood of all the servants of the lord at the hand of jezebel
2ki98 for the whole house of ahab shall perish and i will cut off from ahab him that pisseth against the wall and him that is shut up and left in israel
2ki99 and i will make the house of ahab like the house of jeroboam the son of nebat and like the house of baasha the son of ahijah
2ki910 and the dogs shall eat jezebel in the portion of jezreel and there shall be none to bury her and he opened the door and fled
2ki911 then jehu came forth to the servants of his lord and one said unto him is all well wherefore came this mad fellow to thee and he said unto them ye know the man and his communication
2ki912 and they said it is false tell us now and he said thus and thus spake he to me saying thus saith the lord i have anointed thee king over israel
2ki913 then they hasted and took every man his garment and put it under him on the top of the stairs and blew with trumpets saying jehu is king
2ki914 so jehu the son of jehoshaphat the son of nimshi conspired against joram now joram had kept ramothgilead he and all israel because of hazael king of syria
2ki915 but king joram was returned to be healed in jezreel of the wounds which the syrians had given him when he fought with hazael king of syria and jehu said if it be your minds then let none go forth nor escape out of the city to go to tell it in jezreel
2ki916 so jehu rode in a chariot and went to jezreel for joram lay there and ahaziah king of judah was come down to see joram
2ki917 and there stood a watchman on the tower in jezreel and he spied the company of jehu as he came and said i see a company and joram said take an horseman and send to meet them and let him say is it peace
2ki918 so there went one on horseback to meet him and said thus saith the king is it peace and jehu said what hast thou to do with peace turn thee behind me and the watchman told saying the messenger came to them but he cometh not again
2ki919 then he sent out a second on horseback which came to them and said thus saith the king is it peace and jehu answered what hast thou to do with peace turn thee behind me
2ki920 and the watchman told saying he came even unto them and cometh not again and the driving is like the driving of jehu the son of nimshi for he driveth furiously
2ki921 and joram said make ready and his chariot was made ready and joram king of israel and ahaziah king of judah went out each in his chariot and they went out against jehu and met him in the portion of naboth the jezreelite
2ki922 and it came to pass when joram saw jehu that he said is it peace jehu and he answered what peace so long as the whoredoms of thy mother jezebel and her witchcrafts are so many
2ki923 and joram turned his hands and fled and said to ahaziah there is treachery o ahaziah
2ki924 and jehu drew a bow with his full strength and smote jehoram between his arms and the arrow went out at his heart and he sunk down in his chariot
2ki925 then said jehu to bidkar his captain take up and cast him in the portion of the field of naboth the jezreelite for remember how that when i and thou rode together after ahab his father the lord laid this burden upon him
2ki926 surely i have seen yesterday the blood of naboth and the blood of his sons saith the lord and i will requite thee in this plat saith the lord now therefore take and cast him into the plat of ground according to the word of the lord
2ki927 but when ahaziah the king of judah saw this he fled by the way of the garden house and jehu followed after him and said smite him also in the chariot and they did so at the going up to gur which is by ibleam and he fled to megiddo and died there
2ki928 and his servants carried him in a chariot to jerusalem and buried him in his sepulchre with his fathers in the city of david
2ki929 and in the eleventh year of joram the son of ahab began ahaziah to reign over judah
2ki930 and when jehu was come to jezreel jezebel heard of it and she painted her face and tired her head and looked out at a window
2ki931 and as jehu entered in at the gate she said had zimri peace who slew his master
2ki932 and he lifted up his face to the window and said who is on my side who and there looked out to him two or three eunuchs
2ki933 and he said throw her down so they threw her down and some of her blood was sprinkled on the wall and on the horses and he trode her under foot
2ki934 and when he was come in he did eat and drink and said go see now this cursed woman and bury her for she is a king's daughter
2ki935 and they went to bury her but they found no more of her than the skull and the feet and the palms of her hands
2ki936 wherefore they came again and told him and he said this is the word of the lord which he spake by his servant elijah the tishbite saying in the portion of jezreel shall dogs eat the flesh of jezebel
2ki937 and the carcase of jezebel shall be as dung upon the face of the field in the portion of jezreel so that they shall not say this is jezebel
2ki101 and ahab had seventy sons in samaria and jehu wrote letters and sent to samaria unto the rulers of jezreel to the elders and to them that brought up ahab's children saying
2ki102 now as soon as this letter cometh to you seeing your master's sons are with you and there are with you chariots and horses a fenced city also and armour
2ki103 look even out the best and meetest of your master's sons and set him on his father's throne and fight for your master's house
2ki104 but they were exceedingly afraid and said behold two kings stood not before him how then shall we stand
