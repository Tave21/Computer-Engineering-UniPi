 three and twenty go thy way troilus go thy way
 had i a sister were a grace or a daughter a goddess
 he should take his choice o admirable man paris
 paris is dirt to him and i warrant helen to

cressida here come more
 forces pass
pandarus asses fools dolts chaff and bran chaff and bran
 porridge after meat i could live and die i the
 eyes of troilus ne'er look ne'er look the eagles
 are gone crows and daws crows and daws i had
 rather be such a man as troilus than agamemnon and
 all greece
cressida there is among the greeks achilles a better man than troilus
pandarus achilles a drayman a porter a very camel
cressida well well
pandarus well well why have you any discretion have
 you any eyes do you know what a man is is not
 birth beauty good shape discourse manhood
 learning gentleness virtue youth liberality
 and such like the spice and salt that season a man
cressida ay a minced man and then to be baked with no date
 in the pie for then the man's date's out
pandarus you are such a woman one knows not at what ward you
 lie
cressida upon my back to defend my belly upon my wit to
 defend my wiles upon my secrecy to defend mine
 honesty my mask to defend my beauty and you to
 defend all these and at all these wards i lie at a
 thousand watches
pandarus say one of your watches
cressida nay i'll watch you for that and that's one of the
 chiefest of them too if i cannot ward what i would
 not have hit i can watch you for telling how i took
 the blow unless it swell past hiding and then it's
 past watching
pandarus you are such another
 enter troilus's boy
boy sir my lord would instantly speak with you
pandarus where
boy at your own house there he unarms him
pandarus good boy tell him i come
 exit boy
 i doubt he be hurt fare ye well good niece
cressida adieu uncle
pandarus i'll be with you niece by and by
cressida to bring uncle
pandarus ay a token from troilus
cressida by the same token you are a bawd
 exit pandarus
 words vows gifts tears and love's full sacrifice
 he offers in another's enterprise
 but more in troilus thousand fold i see
 than in the glass of pandar's praise may be
 yet hold i off women are angels wooing
 things won are done joy's soul lies in the doing
 that she beloved knows nought that knows not this
 men prize the thing ungain'd more than it is
 that she was never yet that ever knew
 love got so sweet as when desire did sue
 therefore this maxim out of love i teach
 achievement is command ungain'd beseech
 then though my heart's content firm love doth bear
 nothing of that shall from mine eyes appear
 exeunt
 troilus and cressida
act i
scene iii the grecian camp before agamemnon's tent
 sennet enter agamemnon nestor ulysses
 menelaus and others
agamemnon princes
 what grief hath set the jaundice on your cheeks
 the ample proposition that hope makes
 in all designs begun on earth below
 fails in the promised largeness cheques and disasters
 grow in the veins of actions highest rear'd
 as knots by the conflux of meeting sap
 infect the sound pine and divert his grain
 tortive and errant from his course of growth
 nor princes is it matter new to us
 that we come short of our suppose so far
 that after seven years siege yet troy walls stand
 sith every action that hath gone before
 whereof we have record trial did draw
 bias and thwart not answering the aim
 and that unbodied figure of the thought
 that gave't surmised shape why then you princes
 do you with cheeks abash'd behold our works
 and call them shames which are indeed nought else
 but the protractive trials of great jove
 to find persistive constancy in men
 the fineness of which metal is not found
 in fortune's love for then the bold and coward
 the wise and fool the artist and unread
 the hard and soft seem all affined and kin
 but in the wind and tempest of her frown
 distinction with a broad and powerful fan
 puffing at all winnows the light away
 and what hath mass or matter by itself
 lies rich in virtue and unmingled
nestor with due observance of thy godlike seat
 great agamemnon nestor shall apply
 thy latest words in the reproof of chance
 lies the true proof of men the sea being smooth
 how many shallow bauble boats dare sail
 upon her patient breast making their way
 with those of nobler bulk
 but let the ruffian boreas once enrage
 the gentle thetis and anon behold
 the strongribb'd bark through liquid mountains cut
 bounding between the two moist elements
 like perseus horse where's then the saucy boat
 whose weak untimber'd sides but even now
 corivall'd greatness either to harbour fled
 or made a toast for neptune even so
 doth valour's show and valour's worth divide
 in storms of fortune for in her ray and brightness
 the herd hath more annoyance by the breeze
 than by the tiger but when the splitting wind
 makes flexible the knees of knotted oaks
 and flies fled under shade why then the thing of courage
 as roused with rage with rage doth sympathize
 and with an accent tuned in selfsame key
 retorts to chiding fortune
ulysses agamemnon
 thou great commander nerve and bone of greece
 heart of our numbers soul and only spirit
 in whom the tempers and the minds of all
 should be shut up hear what ulysses speaks
 besides the applause and approbation to which
 to agamemnon
 most mighty for thy place and sway
 to nestor
 and thou most reverend for thy stretch'dout life
 i give to both your speeches which were such
 as agamemnon and the hand of greece
 should hold up high in brass and such again
 as venerable nestor hatch'd in silver
 should with a bond of air strong as the axletree
 on which heaven rides knit all the greekish ears
 to his experienced tongue yet let it please both
 thou great and wise to hear ulysses speak
agamemnon speak prince of ithaca and be't of less expect
 that matter needless of importless burden
 divide thy lips than we are confident
 when rank thersites opes his mastic jaws
 we shall hear music wit and oracle
ulysses troy yet upon his basis had been down
