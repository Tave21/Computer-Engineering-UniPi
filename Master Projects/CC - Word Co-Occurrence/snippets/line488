titania come wait upon him lead him to my bower
 the moon methinks looks with a watery eye
 and when she weeps weeps every little flower
 lamenting some enforced chastity
 tie up my love's tongue bring him silently
 exeunt
 a midsummer night's dream
act iii
scene ii another part of the wood
 enter oberon
oberon i wonder if titania be awaked
 then what it was that next came in her eye
 which she must dote on in extremity
 enter puck
 here comes my messenger
 how now mad spirit
 what nightrule now about this haunted grove
puck my mistress with a monster is in love
 near to her close and consecrated bower
 while she was in her dull and sleeping hour
 a crew of patches rude mechanicals
 that work for bread upon athenian stalls
 were met together to rehearse a play
 intended for great theseus nuptialday
 the shallowest thickskin of that barren sort
 who pyramus presented in their sport
 forsook his scene and enter'd in a brake
 when i did him at this advantage take
 an ass's nole i fixed on his head
 anon his thisbe must be answered
 and forth my mimic comes when they him spy
 as wild geese that the creeping fowler eye
 or russetpated choughs many in sort
 rising and cawing at the gun's report
 sever themselves and madly sweep the sky
 so at his sight away his fellows fly
 and at our stamp here o'er and o'er one falls
 he murder cries and help from athens calls
 their sense thus weak lost with their fears
 thus strong
 made senseless things begin to do them wrong
 for briers and thorns at their apparel snatch
 some sleeves some hats from yielders all
 things catch
 i led them on in this distracted fear
 and left sweet pyramus translated there
 when in that moment so it came to pass
 titania waked and straightway loved an ass
oberon this falls out better than i could devise
 but hast thou yet latch'd the athenian's eyes
 with the lovejuice as i did bid thee do
puck i took him sleepingthat is finish'd too
 and the athenian woman by his side
 that when he waked of force she must be eyed
 enter hermia and demetrius
oberon stand close this is the same athenian
puck this is the woman but not this the man
demetrius o why rebuke you him that loves you so
 lay breath so bitter on your bitter foe
hermia now i but chide but i should use thee worse
 for thou i fear hast given me cause to curse
 if thou hast slain lysander in his sleep
 being o'er shoes in blood plunge in the deep
 and kill me too
 the sun was not so true unto the day
 as he to me would he have stolen away
 from sleeping hermia i'll believe as soon
 this whole earth may be bored and that the moon
 may through the centre creep and so displease
 her brother's noontide with antipodes
 it cannot be but thou hast murder'd him
 so should a murderer look so dead so grim
demetrius so should the murder'd look and so should i
 pierced through the heart with your stern cruelty
 yet you the murderer look as bright as clear
 as yonder venus in her glimmering sphere
hermia what's this to my lysander where is he
 ah good demetrius wilt thou give him me
demetrius i had rather give his carcass to my hounds
hermia out dog out cur thou drivest me past the bounds
 of maiden's patience hast thou slain him then
 henceforth be never number'd among men
 o once tell true tell true even for my sake
 durst thou have look'd upon him being awake
 and hast thou kill'd him sleeping o brave touch
 could not a worm an adder do so much
 an adder did it for with doubler tongue
 than thine thou serpent never adder stung
demetrius you spend your passion on a misprised mood
 i am not guilty of lysander's blood
 nor is he dead for aught that i can tell
hermia i pray thee tell me then that he is well
demetrius an if i could what should i get therefore
hermia a privilege never to see me more
 and from thy hated presence part i so
 see me no more whether he be dead or no
 exit
demetrius there is no following her in this fierce vein
 here therefore for a while i will remain
 so sorrow's heaviness doth heavier grow
 for debt that bankrupt sleep doth sorrow owe
 which now in some slight measure it will pay
 if for his tender here i make some stay
 lies down and sleeps
oberon what hast thou done thou hast mistaken quite
 and laid the lovejuice on some truelove's sight
 of thy misprision must perforce ensue
 some true love turn'd and not a false turn'd true
puck then fate o'errules that one man holding troth
 a million fail confounding oath on oath
oberon about the wood go swifter than the wind
 and helena of athens look thou find
 all fancysick she is and pale of cheer
 with sighs of love that costs the fresh blood dear
 by some illusion see thou bring her here
 i'll charm his eyes against she do appear
puck i go i go look how i go
 swifter than arrow from the tartar's bow
 exit
oberon flower of this purple dye
 hit with cupid's archery
 sink in apple of his eye
 when his love he doth espy
 let her shine as gloriously
 as the venus of the sky
 when thou wakest if she be by
 beg of her for remedy
 reenter puck
puck captain of our fairy band
 helena is here at hand
 and the youth mistook by me
 pleading for a lover's fee
 shall we their fond pageant see
 lord what fools these mortals be
oberon stand aside the noise they make
 will cause demetrius to awake
puck then will two at once woo one
 that must needs be sport alone
 and those things do best please me
 that befal preposterously
 enter lysander and helena
lysander why should you think that i should woo in scorn
 scorn and derision never come in tears
 look when i vow i weep and vows so born
 in their nativity all truth appears
 how can these things in me seem scorn to you
 bearing the badge of faith to prove them true
helena you do advance your cunning more and more
 when truth kills truth o devilishholy fray
 these vows are hermia's will you give her o'er
 weigh oath with oath and you will nothing weigh
 your vows to her and me put in two scales
 will even weigh and both as light as tales
lysander i had no judgment when to her i swore
helena nor none in my mind now you give her o'er
lysander demetrius loves her and he loves not you
demetrius awaking o helena goddess nymph perfect divine
 to what my love shall i compare thine eyne
 crystal is muddy o how ripe in show
 thy lips those kissing cherries tempting grow
 that pure congealed white high taurus snow
 fann'd with the eastern wind turns to a crow
 when thou hold'st up thy hand o let me kiss
 this princess of pure white this seal of bliss
helena o spite o hell i see you all are bent
 to set against me for your merriment
 if you we re civil and knew courtesy
 you would not do me thus much injury
 can you not hate me as i know you do
 but you must join in souls to mock me too
 if you were men as men you are in show
 you would not use a gentle lady so
 to vow and swear and superpraise my parts
 when i am sure you hate me with your hearts
 you both are rivals and love hermia
 and now both rivals to mock helena
 a trim exploit a manly enterprise
 to conjure tears up in a poor maid's eyes
