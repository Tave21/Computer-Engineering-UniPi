my transgression is sealed up in a bag and thou sewest up mine iniquity
and surely the mountain falling cometh to nought and the rock is removed out of his place
the waters wear the stones thou washest away the things which grow out of the dust of the earth and thou destroyest the hope of man
thou prevailest for ever against him and he passeth thou changest his countenance and sendest him away
his sons come to honour and he knoweth it not and they are brought low but he perceiveth it not of them
but his flesh upon him shall have pain and his soul within him shall mourn
then answered eliphaz the temanite and said
should a wise man utter vain knowledge and fill his belly with the east wind
should he reason with unprofitable talk or with speeches wherewith he can do no good
yea thou castest off fear and restrainest prayer before god
for thy mouth uttereth thine iniquity and thou choosest the tongue of the crafty
thine own mouth condemneth thee and not i yea thine own lips testify against thee
art thou the first man that was born or wast thou made before the hills
hast thou heard the secret of god and dost thou restrain wisdom to thyself
what knowest thou that we know not what understandest thou which is not in us
with us are both the grayheaded and very aged men much elder than thy father
are the consolations of god small with thee is there any secret thing with thee
why doth thine heart carry thee away and what do thy eyes wink at
that thou turnest thy spirit against god and lettest such words go out of thy mouth
what is man that he should be clean and he which is born of a woman that he should be righteous
behold he putteth no trust in his saints yea the heavens are not clean in his sight
how much more abominable and filthy is man which drinketh iniquity like water
i will shew thee hear me and that which i have seen i will declare
which wise men have told from their fathers and have not hid it
unto whom alone the earth was given and no stranger passed among them
the wicked man travaileth with pain all his days and the number of years is hidden to the oppressor
a dreadful sound is in his ears in prosperity the destroyer shall come upon him
he believeth not that he shall return out of darkness and he is waited for of the sword
he wandereth abroad for bread saying where is it he knoweth that the day of darkness is ready at his hand
trouble and anguish shall make him afraid they shall prevail against him as a king ready to the battle
for he stretcheth out his hand against god and strengtheneth himself against the almighty
he runneth upon him even on his neck upon the thick bosses of his bucklers
because he covereth his face with his fatness and maketh collops of fat on his flanks
and he dwelleth in desolate cities and in houses which no man inhabiteth which are ready to become heaps
he shall not be rich neither shall his substance continue neither shall he prolong the perfection thereof upon the earth
he shall not depart out of darkness the flame shall dry up his branches and by the breath of his mouth shall he go away
let not him that is deceived trust in vanity for vanity shall be his recompence
it shall be accomplished before his time and his branch shall not be green
he shall shake off his unripe grape as the vine and shall cast off his flower as the olive
for the congregation of hypocrites shall be desolate and fire shall consume the tabernacles of bribery
they conceive mischief and bring forth vanity and their belly prepareth deceit
then job answered and said
i have heard many such things miserable comforters are ye all
shall vain words have an end or what emboldeneth thee that thou answerest
i also could speak as ye do if your soul were in my soul's stead i could heap up words against you and shake mine head at you
but i would strengthen you with my mouth and the moving of my lips should asswage your grief
though i speak my grief is not asswaged and though i forbear what am i eased
but now he hath made me weary thou hast made desolate all my company
and thou hast filled me with wrinkles which is a witness against me and my leanness rising up in me beareth witness to my face
he teareth me in his wrath who hateth me he gnasheth upon me with his teeth mine enemy sharpeneth his eyes upon me
they have gaped upon me with their mouth they have smitten me upon the cheek reproachfully they have gathered themselves together against me
god hath delivered me to the ungodly and turned me over into the hands of the wicked
i was at ease but he hath broken me asunder he hath also taken me by my neck and shaken me to pieces and set me up for his mark
his archers compass me round about he cleaveth my reins asunder and doth not spare he poureth out my gall upon the ground
he breaketh me with breach upon breach he runneth upon me like a giant
i have sewed sackcloth upon my skin and defiled my horn in the dust
my face is foul with weeping and on my eyelids is the shadow of death
not for any injustice in mine hands also my prayer is pure
o earth cover not thou my blood and let my cry have no place
also now behold my witness is in heaven and my record is on high
my friends scorn me but mine eye poureth out tears unto god
o that one might plead for a man with god as a man pleadeth for his neighbour
when a few years are come then i shall go the way whence i shall not return
my breath is corrupt my days are extinct the graves are ready for me
are there not mockers with me and doth not mine eye continue in their provocation
lay down now put me in a surety with thee who is he that will strike hands with me
for thou hast hid their heart from understanding therefore shalt thou not exalt them
he that speaketh flattery to his friends even the eyes of his children shall fail
he hath made me also a byword of the people and aforetime i was as a tabret
mine eye also is dim by reason of sorrow and all my members are as a shadow
upright men shall be astonied at this and the innocent shall stir up himself against the hypocrite
the righteous also shall hold on his way and he that hath clean hands shall be stronger and stronger
but as for you all do ye return and come now for i cannot find one wise man among you
my days are past my purposes are broken off even the thoughts of my heart
they change the night into day the light is short because of darkness
if i wait the grave is mine house i have made my bed in the darkness
i have said to corruption thou art my father to the worm thou art my mother and my sister
and where is now my hope as for my hope who shall see it
they shall go down to the bars of the pit when our rest together is in the dust
then answered bildad the shuhite and said
how long will it be ere ye make an end of words mark and afterwards we will speak
wherefore are we counted as beasts and reputed vile in your sight
he teareth himself in his anger shall the earth be forsaken for thee and shall the rock be removed out of his place
yea the light of the wicked shall be put out and the spark of his fire shall not shine
the light shall be dark in his tabernacle and his candle shall be put out with him
the steps of his strength shall be straitened and his own counsel shall cast him down
for he is cast into a net by his own feet and he walketh upon a snare
the gin shall take him by the heel and the robber shall prevail against him
the snare is laid for him in the ground and a trap for him in the way
terrors shall make him afraid on every side and shall drive him to his feet
his strength shall be hungerbitten and destruction shall be ready at his side
it shall devour the strength of his skin even the firstborn of death shall devour his strength
his confidence shall be rooted out of his tabernacle and it shall bring him to the king of terrors
it shall dwell in his tabernacle because it is none of his brimstone shall be scattered upon his habitation
his roots shall be dried up beneath and above shall his branch be cut off
his remembrance shall perish from the earth and he shall have no name in the street
he shall be driven from light into darkness and chased out of the world
he shall neither have son nor nephew among his people nor any remaining in his dwellings
they that come after him shall be astonied at his day as they that went before were affrighted
surely such are the dwellings of the wicked and this is the place of him that knoweth not god
then job answered and said
how long will ye vex my soul and break me in pieces with words
these ten times have ye reproached me ye are not ashamed that ye make yourselves strange to me
and be it indeed that i have erred mine error remaineth with myself
if indeed ye will magnify yourselves against me and plead against me my reproach
know now that god hath overthrown me and hath compassed me with his net
behold i cry out of wrong but i am not heard i cry aloud but there is no judgment
he hath fenced up my way that i cannot pass and he hath set darkness in my paths
he hath stripped me of my glory and taken the crown from my head
he hath destroyed me on every side and i am gone and mine hope hath he removed like a tree
he hath also kindled his wrath against me and he counteth me unto him as one of his enemies
his troops come together and raise up their way against me and encamp round about my tabernacle
he hath put my brethren far from me and mine acquaintance are verily estranged from me
my kinsfolk have failed and my familiar friends have forgotten me
they that dwell in mine house and my maids count me for a stranger i am an alien in their sight
i called my servant and he gave me no answer i intreated him with my mouth
my breath is strange to my wife though i intreated for the children's sake of mine own body
yea young children despised me i arose and they spake against me
all my inward friends abhorred me and they whom i loved are turned against me
my bone cleaveth to my skin and to my flesh and i am escaped with the skin of my teeth
have pity upon me have pity upon me o ye my friends for the hand of god hath touched me
why do ye persecute me as god and are not satisfied with my flesh
oh that my words were now written oh that they were printed in a book
that they were graven with an iron pen and lead in the rock for ever
for i know that my redeemer liveth and that he shall stand at the latter day upon the earth
and though after my skin worms destroy this body yet in my flesh shall i see god
whom i shall see for myself and mine eyes shall behold and not another though my reins be consumed within me
but ye should say why persecute we him seeing the root of the matter is found in me
be ye afraid of the sword for wrath bringeth the punishments of the sword that ye may know there is a judgment
then answered zophar the naamathite and said
therefore do my thoughts cause me to answer and for this i make haste
i have heard the check of my reproach and the spirit of my understanding causeth me to answer
knowest thou not this of old since man was placed upon earth
that the triumphing of the wicked is short and the joy of the hypocrite but for a moment
though his excellency mount up to the heavens and his head reach unto the clouds
yet he shall perish for ever like his own dung they which have seen him shall say where is he
he shall fly away as a dream and shall not be found yea he shall be chased away as a vision of the night
the eye also which saw him shall see him no more neither shall his place any more behold him
his children shall seek to please the poor and his hands shall restore their goods
his bones are full of the sin of his youth which shall lie down with him in the dust
though wickedness be sweet in his mouth though he hide it under his tongue
though he spare it and forsake it not but keep it still within his mouth
yet his meat in his bowels is turned it is the gall of asps within him
he hath swallowed down riches and he shall vomit them up again god shall cast them out of his belly
he shall suck the poison of asps the viper's tongue shall slay him
he shall not see the rivers the floods the brooks of honey and butter
that which he laboured for shall he restore and shall not swallow it down according to his substance shall the restitution be and he shall not rejoice therein
because he hath oppressed and hath forsaken the poor because he hath violently taken away an house which he builded not
surely he shall not feel quietness in his belly he shall not save of that which he desired
there shall none of his meat be left therefore shall no man look for his goods
in the fulness of his sufficiency he shall be in straits every hand of the wicked shall come upon him
when he is about to fill his belly god shall cast the fury of his wrath upon him and shall rain it upon him while he is eating
he shall flee from the iron weapon and the bow of steel shall strike him through
it is drawn and cometh out of the body yea the glittering sword cometh out of his gall terrors are upon him
all darkness shall be hid in his secret places a fire not blown shall consume him it shall go ill with him that is left in his tabernacle
the heaven shall reveal his iniquity and the earth shall rise up against him
the increase of his house shall depart and his goods shall flow away in the day of his wrath
this is the portion of a wicked man from god and the heritage appointed unto him by god
but job answered and said
hear diligently my speech and let this be your consolations
suffer me that i may speak and after that i have spoken mock on
as for me is my complaint to man and if it were so why should not my spirit be troubled
mark me and be astonished and lay your hand upon your mouth
even when i remember i am afraid and trembling taketh hold on my flesh
wherefore do the wicked live become old yea are mighty in power
their seed is established in their sight with them and their offspring before their eyes
their houses are safe from fear neither is the rod of god upon them
their bull gendereth and faileth not their cow calveth and casteth not her calf
they send forth their little ones like a flock and their children dance
they take the timbrel and harp and rejoice at the sound of the organ
they spend their days in wealth and in a moment go down to the grave
therefore they say unto god depart from us for we desire not the knowledge of thy ways
what is the almighty that we should serve him and what profit should we have if we pray unto him
lo their good is not in their hand the counsel of the wicked is far from me
how oft is the candle of the wicked put out and how oft cometh their destruction upon them god distributeth sorrows in his anger
they are as stubble before the wind and as chaff that the storm carrieth away
god layeth up his iniquity for his children he rewardeth him and he shall know it
his eyes shall see his destruction and he shall drink of the wrath of the almighty
for what pleasure hath he in his house after him when the number of his months is cut off in the midst
shall any teach god knowledge seeing he judgeth those that are high
one dieth in his full strength being wholly at ease and quiet
his breasts are full of milk and his bones are moistened with marrow
and another dieth in the bitterness of his soul and never eateth with pleasure
they shall lie down alike in the dust and the worms shall cover them
behold i know your thoughts and the devices which ye wrongfully imagine against me
for ye say where is the house of the prince and where are the dwelling places of the wicked
have ye not asked them that go by the way and do ye not know their tokens
that the wicked is reserved to the day of destruction they shall be brought forth to the day of wrath
who shall declare his way to his face and who shall repay him what he hath done
yet shall he be brought to the grave and shall remain in the tomb
the clods of the valley shall be sweet unto him and every man shall draw after him as there are innumerable before him
how then comfort ye me in vain seeing in your answers there remaineth falsehood
then eliphaz the temanite answered and said
can a man be profitable unto god as he that is wise may be profitable unto himself
is it any pleasure to the almighty that thou art righteous or is it gain to him that thou makest thy ways perfect
will he reprove thee for fear of thee will he enter with thee into judgment
is not thy wickedness great and thine iniquities infinite
for thou hast taken a pledge from thy brother for nought and stripped the naked of their clothing
thou hast not given water to the weary to drink and thou hast withholden bread from the hungry
but as for the mighty man he had the earth and the honourable man dwelt in it
