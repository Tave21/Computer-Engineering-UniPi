 advantage of hope i will indeed no longer endure
 it nor am i yet persuaded to put up in peace what
 already i have foolishly suffered
iago will you hear me roderigo
roderigo faith i have heard too much for your words and
 performances are no kin together
iago you charge me most unjustly
roderigo with nought but truth i have wasted myself out of
 my means the jewels you have had from me to
 deliver to desdemona would half have corrupted a
 votarist you have told me she hath received them
 and returned me expectations and comforts of sudden
 respect and acquaintance but i find none
iago well go to very well
roderigo very well go to i cannot go to man nor tis
 not very well nay i think it is scurvy and begin
 to find myself fobbed in it
iago very well
roderigo i tell you tis not very well i will make myself
 known to desdemona if she will return me my
 jewels i will give over my suit and repent my
 unlawful solicitation if not assure yourself i
 will seek satisfaction of you
iago you have said now
roderigo ay and said nothing but what i protest intendment of doing
iago why now i see there's mettle in thee and even from
 this instant to build on thee a better opinion than
 ever before give me thy hand roderigo thou hast
 taken against me a most just exception but yet i
 protest i have dealt most directly in thy affair
roderigo it hath not appeared
iago i grant indeed it hath not appeared and your
 suspicion is not without wit and judgment but
 roderigo if thou hast that in thee indeed which i
 have greater reason to believe now than ever i mean
 purpose courage and valour this night show it if
 thou the next night following enjoy not desdemona
 take me from this world with treachery and devise
 engines for my life
roderigo well what is it is it within reason and compass
iago sir there is especial commission come from venice
 to depute cassio in othello's place
roderigo is that true why then othello and desdemona
 return again to venice
iago o no he goes into mauritania and takes away with
 him the fair desdemona unless his abode be
 lingered here by some accident wherein none can be
 so determinate as the removing of cassio
roderigo how do you mean removing of him
iago why by making him uncapable of othello's place
 knocking out his brains
roderigo and that you would have me to do
iago ay if you dare do yourself a profit and a right
 he sups tonight with a harlotry and thither will i
 go to him he knows not yet of his horrorable
 fortune if you will watch his going thence which
 i will fashion to fall out between twelve and one
 you may take him at your pleasure i will be near
 to second your attempt and he shall fall between
 us come stand not amazed at it but go along with
 me i will show you such a necessity in his death
 that you shall think yourself bound to put it on
 him it is now high suppertime and the night grows
 to waste about it
roderigo i will hear further reason for this
iago and you shall be satisfied

 attendants
lodovico i do beseech you sir trouble yourself no further

othello will you walk sir
 odesdemona
desdemona my lord
othello get you to bed on the instant i will be returned
 forthwith dismiss your attendant there look it be done
desdemona i will my lord
 exeunt othello lodovico and attendants
emilia how goes it now he looks gentler than he did
desdemona he says he will return incontinent
 he hath commanded me to go to bed
 and bade me to dismiss you
emilia dismiss me
desdemona it was his bidding therefore good emilia
 give me my nightly wearing and adieu
 we must not now displease him
emilia i would you had never seen him
desdemona so would not i my love doth so approve him
 that even his stubbornness his cheques his frowns
 prithee unpin mehave grace and favour in them
emilia i have laid those sheets you bade me on the bed
desdemona all's one good faith how foolish are our minds
 if i do die before thee prithee shroud me
 in one of those same sheets
emilia come come you talk
desdemona my mother had a maid call'd barbara
 she was in love and he she loved proved mad
 and did forsake her she had a song of willow'
 an old thing twas but it express'd her fortune
 and she died singing it that song tonight
 will not go from my mind i have much to do
 but to go hang my head all at one side
 and sing it like poor barbara prithee dispatch
emilia shall i go fetch your nightgown
desdemona no unpin me here
 this lodovico is a proper man
emilia a very handsome man
desdemona he speaks well
emilia i know a lady in venice would have walked barefoot
 to palestine for a touch of his nether lip
desdemona singing the poor soul sat sighing by a sycamore tree
 sing all a green willow
 her hand on her bosom her head on her knee
 sing willow willow willow
 the fresh streams ran by her and murmur'd her moans
 sing willow willow willow
 her salt tears fell from her and soften'd the stones
 lay by these
 singing
 sing willow willow willow
 prithee hie thee he'll come anon
 singing
 sing all a green willow must be my garland
 let nobody blame him his scorn i approve
 nay that's not nexthark who is't that knocks
emilia it's the wind
desdemona singing i call'd my love false love but what
 said he then
 sing willow willow willow
 if i court moe women you'll couch with moe men
 so get thee gone good night ate eyes do itch
 doth that bode weeping
emilia tis neither here nor there
desdemona i have heard it said so o these men these men
 dost thou in conscience thinktell me emilia
 that there be women do abuse their husbands
 in such gross kind
emilia there be some such no question
desdemona wouldst thou do such a deed for all the world
emilia why would not you
desdemona no by this heavenly light
emilia nor i neither by this heavenly light
 i might do't as well i the dark
desdemona wouldst thou do such a deed for all the world
emilia the world's a huge thing it is a great price
 for a small vice
desdemona in troth i think thou wouldst not
emilia in troth i think i should and undo't when i had
 done marry i would not do such a thing for a
 jointring nor for measures of lawn nor for
 gowns petticoats nor caps nor any petty
 exhibition but for the whole worldwhy who would
 not make her husband a cuckold to make him a
 monarch i should venture purgatory for't
desdemona beshrew me if i would do such a wrong
 for the whole world
emilia why the wrong is but a wrong i the world and
 having the world for your labour tis a wrong in your
 own world and you might quickly make it right
desdemona i do not think there is any such woman
emilia yes a dozen and as many to the vantage as would
 store the world they played for
 but i do think it is their husbands faults
 if wives do fall say that they slack their duties
 and pour our treasures into foreign laps
 or else break out in peevish jealousies
 throwing restraint upon us or say they strike us
 or scant our former having in despite
 why we have galls and though we have some grace
 yet have we some revenge let husbands know
 their wives have sense like them they see and smell
 and have their palates both for sweet and sour
 as husbands have what is it that they do
 when they change us for others is it sport
 i think it is and doth affection breed it
 i think it doth is't frailty that thus errs
 it is so too and have not we affections
 desires for sport and frailty as men have
 then let them use us well else let them know
 the ills we do their ills instruct us so
desdemona good night good night heaven me such uses send
 not to pick bad from bad but by bad mend
