 country there be nothing compelled from the
 villages nothing taken but paid for none of the
 french upbraided or abused in disdainful language
 for when lenity and cruelty play for a kingdom the
 gentler gamester is the soonest winner
 tucket enter montjoy
montjoy you know me by my habit
king henry v well then i know thee what shall i know of thee
montjoy my master's mind
king henry v unfold it
montjoy thus says my king say thou to harry of england
 though we seemed dead we did but sleep advantage
 is a better soldier than rashness tell him we
 could have rebuked him at harfleur but that we
 thought not good to bruise an injury till it were
 full ripe now we speak upon our cue and our voice
 is imperial england shall repent his folly see
 his weakness and admire our sufferance bid him
 therefore consider of his ransom which must
 proportion the losses we have borne the subjects we
 have lost the disgrace we have digested which in
 weight to reanswer his pettiness would bow under
 for our losses his exchequer is too poor for the
 effusion of our blood the muster of his kingdom too
 faint a number and for our disgrace his own
 person kneeling at our feet but a weak and
 worthless satisfaction to this add defiance and
 tell him for conclusion he hath betrayed his
 followers whose condemnation is pronounced so far
 my king and master so much my office
king henry v what is thy name i know thy quality
montjoy montjoy
king henry v thou dost thy office fairly turn thee back
 and tell thy king i do not seek him now
 but could be willing to march on to calais
 without impeachment for to say the sooth
 though tis no wisdom to confess so much
 unto an enemy of craft and vantage
 my people are with sickness much enfeebled
 my numbers lessened and those few i have
 almost no better than so many french
 who when they were in health i tell thee herald
 i thought upon one pair of english legs
 did march three frenchmen yet forgive me god
 that i do brag thus this your air of france
 hath blown that vice in me i must repent
 go therefore tell thy master here i am
 my ransom is this frail and worthless trunk
 my army but a weak and sickly guard
 yet god before tell him we will come on
 though france himself and such another neighbour
 stand in our way there's for thy labour montjoy
 go bid thy master well advise himself
 if we may pass we will if we be hinder'd
 we shall your tawny ground with your red blood
 discolour and so montjoy fare you well
 the sum of all our answer is but this
 we would not seek a battle as we are
 nor as we are we say we will not shun it
 so tell your master
montjoy i shall deliver so thanks to your highness
 exit
gloucester i hope they will not come upon us now
king henry v we are in god's hand brother not in theirs
 march to the bridge it now draws toward night
 beyond the river we'll encamp ourselves
 and on tomorrow bid them march away
 exeunt
 king henry v
act iii
scene vii the french camp near agincourt
 enter the constable of france the lord rambures
 orleans dauphin with others
constable tut i have the best armour of the world would it were day
orleans you have an excellent armour but let my horse have his due
constable it is the best horse of europe
orleans will it never be morning
dauphin my lord of orleans and my lord high constable you
 talk of horse and armour
orleans you are as well provided of both as any prince in the world
dauphin what a long night is this i will not change my
 horse with any that treads but on four pasterns
 ca ha he bounds from the earth as if his
 entrails were hairs le cheval volant the pegasus
 chez les narines de feu when i bestride him i
 soar i am a hawk he trots the air the earth
 sings when he touches it the basest horn of his
 hoof is more musical than the pipe of hermes
orleans he's of the colour of the nutmeg
dauphin and of the heat of the ginger it is a beast for
 perseus he is pure air and fire and the dull
 elements of earth and water never appear in him but
 only in patient stillness while his rider mounts
 him he is indeed a horse and all other jades you
 may call beasts
constable indeed my lord it is a most absolute and excellent horse
dauphin it is the prince of palfreys his neigh is like the
 bidding of a monarch and his countenance enforces homage
orleans no more cousin
dauphin nay the man hath no wit that cannot from the
 rising of the lark to the lodging of the lamb vary
 deserved praise on my palfrey it is a theme as
 fluent as the sea turn the sands into eloquent
 tongues and my horse is argument for them all
 tis a subject for a sovereign to reason on and for
 a sovereign's sovereign to ride on and for the
 world familiar to us and unknown to lay apart
 their particular functions and wonder at him i
 once writ a sonnet in his praise and began thus
 wonder of nature'
orleans i have heard a sonnet begin so to one's mistress
dauphin then did they imitate that which i composed to my
 courser for my horse is my mistress
orleans your mistress bears well
dauphin me well which is the prescript praise and
 perfection of a good and particular mistress
constable nay for methought yesterday your mistress shrewdly
 shook your back
dauphin so perhaps did yours
constable mine was not bridled
dauphin o then belike she was old and gentle and you rode
 like a kern of ireland your french hose off and in
 your straight strossers
constable you have good judgment in horsemanship
dauphin be warned by me then they that ride so and ride
 not warily fall into foul bogs i had rather have
 my horse to my mistress
constable i had as lief have my mistress a jade
dauphin i tell thee constable my mistress wears his own hair
constable i could make as true a boast as that if i had a sow
 to my mistress
dauphin le chien est retourne a son propre vomissement et
 la truie lavee au bourbier thou makest use of any thing
constable yet do i not use my horse for my mistress or any
 such proverb so little kin to the purpose
rambures my lord constable the armour that i saw in your tent
 tonight are those stars or suns upon it
constable stars my lord
dauphin some of them will fall tomorrow i hope
constable and yet my sky shall not want
dauphin that may be for you bear a many superfluously and
 twere more honour some were away
constable even as your horse bears your praises who would
 trot as well were some of your brags dismounted
dauphin would i were able to load him with his desert will
 it never be day i will trot tomorrow a mile and
 my way shall be paved with english faces
constable i will not say so for fear i should be faced out of
 my way but i would it were morning for i would
 fain be about the ears of the english
rambures who will go to hazard with me for twenty prisoners
constable you must first go yourself to hazard ere you have them
dauphin tis midnight i'll go arm myself
 exit
orleans the dauphin longs for morning
rambures he longs to eat the english
constable i think he will eat all he kills
orleans by the white hand of my lady he's a gallant prince
constable swear by her foot that she may tread out the oath
orleans he is simply the most active gentleman of france
constable doing is activity and he will still be doing
orleans he never did harm that i heard of
constable nor will do none tomorrow he will keep that good name still
orleans i know him to be valiant
constable i was told that by one that knows him better than
 you
orleans what's he
constable marry he told me so himself and he said he cared
 not who knew it
orleans he needs not it is no hidden virtue in him
constable by my faith sir but it is never any body saw it
 but his lackey tis a hooded valour and when it
 appears it will bate
orleans ill will never said well
constable i will cap that proverb with there is flattery in friendship'
orleans and i will take up that with give the devil his due'
constable well placed there stands your friend for the
 devil have at the very eye of that proverb with a
 pox of the devil'
orleans you are the better at proverbs by how much a
 fool's bolt is soon shot'
constable you have shot over
orleans tis not the first time you were overshot
 enter a messenger
messenger my lord high constable the english lie within
 fifteen hundred paces of your tents
constable who hath measured the ground
messenger the lord grandpre
constable a valiant and most expert gentleman would it were
 day alas poor harry of england he longs not for
 the dawning as we do
orleans what a wretched and peevish fellow is this king of
 england to mope with his fatbrained followers so
 far out of his knowledge
constable if the english had any apprehension they would run away
orleans that they lack for if their heads had any
 intellectual armour they could never wear such heavy
 headpieces
rambures that island of england breeds very valiant
 creatures their mastiffs are of unmatchable courage
