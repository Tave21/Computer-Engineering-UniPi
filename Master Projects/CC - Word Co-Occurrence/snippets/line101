and the most proud shall stumble and fall and none shall raise him up and i will kindle a fire in his cities and it shall devour all round about him
thus saith the lord of hosts the children of israel and the children of judah were oppressed together and all that took them captives held them fast they refused to let them go
their redeemer is strong the lord of hosts is his name he shall throughly plead their cause that he may give rest to the land and disquiet the inhabitants of babylon
a sword is upon the chaldeans saith the lord and upon the inhabitants of babylon and upon her princes and upon her wise men
a sword is upon the liars and they shall dote a sword is upon her mighty men and they shall be dismayed
a sword is upon their horses and upon their chariots and upon all the mingled people that are in the midst of her and they shall become as women a sword is upon her treasures and they shall be robbed
a drought is upon her waters and they shall be dried up for it is the land of graven images and they are mad upon their idols
therefore the wild beasts of the desert with the wild beasts of the islands shall dwell there and the owls shall dwell therein and it shall be no more inhabited for ever neither shall it be dwelt in from generation to generation
as god overthrew sodom and gomorrah and the neighbour cities thereof saith the lord so shall no man abide there neither shall any son of man dwell therein
behold a people shall come from the north and a great nation and many kings shall be raised up from the coasts of the earth
they shall hold the bow and the lance they are cruel and will not shew mercy their voice shall roar like the sea and they shall ride upon horses every one put in array like a man to the battle against thee o daughter of babylon
the king of babylon hath heard the report of them and his hands waxed feeble anguish took hold of him and pangs as of a woman in travail
behold he shall come up like a lion from the swelling of jordan unto the habitation of the strong but i will make them suddenly run away from her and who is a chosen man that i may appoint over her for who is like me and who will appoint me the time and who is that shepherd that will stand before me
therefore hear ye the counsel of the lord that he hath taken against babylon and his purposes that he hath purposed against the land of the chaldeans surely the least of the flock shall draw them out surely he shall make their habitation desolate with them
at the noise of the taking of babylon the earth is moved and the cry is heard among the nations
thus saith the lord behold i will raise up against babylon and against them that dwell in the midst of them that rise up against me a destroying wind
and will send unto babylon fanners that shall fan her and shall empty her land for in the day of trouble they shall be against her round about
against him that bendeth let the archer bend his bow and against him that lifteth himself up in his brigandine and spare ye not her young men destroy ye utterly all her host
thus the slain shall fall in the land of the chaldeans and they that are thrust through in her streets
for israel hath not been forsaken nor judah of his god of the lord of hosts though their land was filled with sin against the holy one of israel
flee out of the midst of babylon and deliver every man his soul be not cut off in her iniquity for this is the time of the lord's vengeance he will render unto her a recompence
babylon hath been a golden cup in the lord's hand that made all the earth drunken the nations have drunken of her wine therefore the nations are mad
babylon is suddenly fallen and destroyed howl for her take balm for her pain if so be she may be healed
we would have healed babylon but she is not healed forsake her and let us go every one into his own country for her judgment reacheth unto heaven and is lifted up even to the skies
the lord hath brought forth our righteousness come and let us declare in zion the work of the lord our god
make bright the arrows gather the shields the lord hath raised up the spirit of the kings of the medes for his device is against babylon to destroy it because it is the vengeance of the lord the vengeance of his temple
set up the standard upon the walls of babylon make the watch strong set up the watchmen prepare the ambushes for the lord hath both devised and done that which he spake against the inhabitants of babylon
o thou that dwellest upon many waters abundant in treasures thine end is come and the measure of thy covetousness
the lord of hosts hath sworn by himself saying surely i will fill thee with men as with caterpillers and they shall lift up a shout against thee
he hath made the earth by his power he hath established the world by his wisdom and hath stretched out the heaven by his understanding
when he uttereth his voice there is a multitude of waters in the heavens and he causeth the vapours to ascend from the ends of the earth he maketh lightnings with rain and bringeth forth the wind out of his treasures
every man is brutish by his knowledge every founder is confounded by the graven image for his molten image is falsehood and there is no breath in them
they are vanity the work of errors in the time of their visitation they shall perish
the portion of jacob is not like them for he is the former of all things and israel is the rod of his inheritance the lord of hosts is his name
thou art my battle axe and weapons of war for with thee will i break in pieces the nations and with thee will i destroy kingdoms
and with thee will i break in pieces the horse and his rider and with thee will i break in pieces the chariot and his rider
with thee also will i break in pieces man and woman and with thee will i break in pieces old and young and with thee will i break in pieces the young man and the maid
i will also break in pieces with thee the shepherd and his flock and with thee will i break in pieces the husbandman and his yoke of oxen and with thee will i break in pieces captains and rulers
and i will render unto babylon and to all the inhabitants of chaldea all their evil that they have done in zion in your sight saith the lord
behold i am against thee o destroying mountain saith the lord which destroyest all the earth and i will stretch out mine hand upon thee and roll thee down from the rocks and will make thee a burnt mountain
and they shall not take of thee a stone for a corner nor a stone for foundations but thou shalt be desolate for ever saith the lord
set ye up a standard in the land blow the trumpet among the nations prepare the nations against her call together against her the kingdoms of ararat minni and ashchenaz appoint a captain against her cause the horses to come up as the rough caterpillers
prepare against her the nations with the kings of the medes the captains thereof and all the rulers thereof and all the land of his dominion
and the land shall tremble and sorrow for every purpose of the lord shall be performed against babylon to make the land of babylon a desolation without an inhabitant
the mighty men of babylon have forborn to fight they have remained in their holds their might hath failed they became as women they have burned her dwellingplaces her bars are broken
one post shall run to meet another and one messenger to meet another to shew the king of babylon that his city is taken at one end
and that the passages are stopped and the reeds they have burned with fire and the men of war are affrighted
for thus saith the lord of hosts the god of israel the daughter of babylon is like a threshingfloor it is time to thresh her yet a little while and the time of her harvest shall come
nebuchadrezzar the king of babylon hath devoured me he hath crushed me he hath made me an empty vessel he hath swallowed me up like a dragon he hath filled his belly with my delicates he hath cast me out
the violence done to me and to my flesh be upon babylon shall the inhabitant of zion say and my blood upon the inhabitants of chaldea shall jerusalem say
therefore thus saith the lord behold i will plead thy cause and take vengeance for thee and i will dry up her sea and make her springs dry
and babylon shall become heaps a dwellingplace for dragons an astonishment and an hissing without an inhabitant
they shall roar together like lions they shall yell as lions whelps
in their heat i will make their feasts and i will make them drunken that they may rejoice and sleep a perpetual sleep and not wake saith the lord
i will bring them down like lambs to the slaughter like rams with he goats
how is sheshach taken and how is the praise of the whole earth surprised how is babylon become an astonishment among the nations
the sea is come up upon babylon she is covered with the multitude of the waves thereof
her cities are a desolation a dry land and a wilderness a land wherein no man dwelleth neither doth any son of man pass thereby
and i will punish bel in babylon and i will bring forth out of his mouth that which he hath swallowed up and the nations shall not flow together any more unto him yea the wall of babylon shall fall
my people go ye out of the midst of her and deliver ye every man his soul from the fierce anger of the lord
and lest your heart faint and ye fear for the rumour that shall be heard in the land a rumour shall both come one year and after that in another year shall come a rumour and violence in the land ruler against ruler
therefore behold the days come that i will do judgment upon the graven images of babylon and her whole land shall be confounded and all her slain shall fall in the midst of her
then the heaven and the earth and all that is therein shall sing for babylon for the spoilers shall come unto her from the north saith the lord
as babylon hath caused the slain of israel to fall so at babylon shall fall the slain of all the earth
ye that have escaped the sword go away stand not still remember the lord afar off and let jerusalem come into your mind
we are confounded because we have heard reproach shame hath covered our faces for strangers are come into the sanctuaries of the lord's house
wherefore behold the days come saith the lord that i will do judgment upon her graven images and through all her land the wounded shall groan
though babylon should mount up to heaven and though she should fortify the height of her strength yet from me shall spoilers come unto her saith the lord
a sound of a cry cometh from babylon and great destruction from the land of the chaldeans
because the lord hath spoiled babylon and destroyed out of her the great voice when her waves do roar like great waters a noise of their voice is uttered
because the spoiler is come upon her even upon babylon and her mighty men are taken every one of their bows is broken for the lord god of recompences shall surely requite
and i will make drunk her princes and her wise men her captains and her rulers and her mighty men and they shall sleep a perpetual sleep and not wake saith the king whose name is the lord of hosts
thus saith the lord of hosts the broad walls of babylon shall be utterly broken and her high gates shall be burned with fire and the people shall labour in vain and the folk in the fire and they shall be weary
the word which jeremiah the prophet commanded seraiah the son of neriah the son of maaseiah when he went with zedekiah the king of judah into babylon in the fourth year of his reign and this seraiah was a quiet prince
so jeremiah wrote in a book all the evil that should come upon babylon even all these words that are written against babylon
and jeremiah said to seraiah when thou comest to babylon and shalt see and shalt read all these words
then shalt thou say o lord thou hast spoken against this place to cut it off that none shall remain in it neither man nor beast but that it shall be desolate for ever
and it shall be when thou hast made an end of reading this book that thou shalt bind a stone to it and cast it into the midst of euphrates
and thou shalt say thus shall babylon sink and shall not rise from the evil that i will bring upon her and they shall be weary thus far are the words of jeremiah
zedekiah was one and twenty years old when he began to reign and he reigned eleven years in jerusalem and his mother's name was hamutal the daughter of jeremiah of libnah
and he did that which was evil in the eyes of the lord according to all that jehoiakim had done
for through the anger of the lord it came to pass in jerusalem and judah till he had cast them out from his presence that zedekiah rebelled against the king of babylon
and it came to pass in the ninth year of his reign in the tenth month in the tenth day of the month that nebuchadrezzar king of babylon came he and all his army against jerusalem and pitched against it and built forts against it round about
so the city was besieged unto the eleventh year of king zedekiah
and in the fourth month in the ninth day of the month the famine was sore in the city so that there was no bread for the people of the land
then the city was broken up and all the men of war fled and went forth out of the city by night by the way of the gate between the two walls which was by the king's garden now the chaldeans were by the city round about and they went by the way of the plain
but the army of the chaldeans pursued after the king and overtook zedekiah in the plains of jericho and all his army was scattered from him
then they took the king and carried him up unto the king of babylon to riblah in the land of hamath where he gave judgment upon him
and the king of babylon slew the sons of zedekiah before his eyes he slew also all the princes of judah in riblah
then he put out the eyes of zedekiah and the king of babylon bound him in chains and carried him to babylon and put him in prison till the day of his death
now in the fifth month in the tenth day of the month which was the nineteenth year of nebuchadrezzar king of babylon came nebuzaradan captain of the guard which served the king of babylon into jerusalem
and burned the house of the lord and the king's house and all the houses of jerusalem and all the houses of the great men burned he with fire
and all the army of the chaldeans that were with the captain of the guard brake down all the walls of jerusalem round about
then nebuzaradan the captain of the guard carried away captive certain of the poor of the people and the residue of the people that remained in the city and those that fell away that fell to the king of babylon and the rest of the multitude
but nebuzaradan the captain of the guard left certain of the poor of the land for vinedressers and for husbandmen
also the pillars of brass that were in the house of the lord and the bases and the brasen sea that was in the house of the lord the chaldeans brake and carried all the brass of them to babylon
the caldrons also and the shovels and the snuffers and the bowls and the spoons and all the vessels of brass wherewith they ministered took they away
and the basons and the firepans and the bowls and the caldrons and the candlesticks and the spoons and the cups that which was of gold in gold and that which was of silver in silver took the captain of the guard away
the two pillars one sea and twelve brasen bulls that were under the bases which king solomon had made in the house of the lord the brass of all these vessels was without weight
and concerning the pillars the height of one pillar was eighteen cubits and a fillet of twelve cubits did compass it and the thickness thereof was four fingers it was hollow
and a chapiter of brass was upon it and the height of one chapiter was five cubits with network and pomegranates upon the chapiters round about all of brass the second pillar also and the pomegranates were like unto these
and there were ninety and six pomegranates on a side and all the pomegranates upon the network were an hundred round about
and the captain of the guard took seraiah the chief priest and zephaniah the second priest and the three keepers of the door
he took also out of the city an eunuch which had the charge of the men of war and seven men of them that were near the king's person which were found in the city and the principal scribe of the host who mustered the people of the land and threescore men of the people of the land that were found in the midst of the city
so nebuzaradan the captain of the guard took them and brought them to the king of babylon to riblah
and the king of babylon smote them and put them to death in riblah in the land of hamath thus judah was carried away captive out of his own land
this is the people whom nebuchadrezzar carried away captive in the seventh year three thousand jews and three and twenty
in the eighteenth year of nebuchadrezzar he carried away captive from jerusalem eight hundred thirty and two persons
in the three and twentieth year of nebuchadrezzar nebuzaradan the captain of the guard carried away captive of the jews seven hundred forty and five persons all the persons were four thousand and six hundred
and it came to pass in the seven and thirtieth year of the captivity of jehoiachin king of judah in the twelfth month in the five and twentieth day of the month that evilmerodach king of babylon in the first year of his reign lifted up the head of jehoiachin king of judah and brought him forth out of prison
and spake kindly unto him and set his throne above the throne of the kings that were with him in babylon
and changed his prison garments and he did continually eat bread before him all the days of his life
and for his diet there was a continual diet given him of the king of babylon every day a portion until the day of his death all the days of his life
how doth the city sit solitary that was full of people how is she become as a widow she that was great among the nations and princess among the provinces how is she become tributary
she weepeth sore in the night and her tears are on her cheeks among all her lovers she hath none to comfort her all her friends have dealt treacherously with her they are become her enemies
judah is gone into captivity because of affliction and because of great servitude she dwelleth among the heathen she findeth no rest all her persecutors overtook her between the straits
the ways of zion do mourn because none come to the solemn feasts all her gates are desolate her priests sigh her virgins are afflicted and she is in bitterness
her adversaries are the chief her enemies prosper for the lord hath afflicted her for the multitude of her transgressions her children are gone into captivity before the enemy
and from the daughter of zion all her beauty is departed her princes are become like harts that find no pasture and they are gone without strength before the pursuer
jerusalem remembered in the days of her affliction and of her miseries all her pleasant things that she had in the days of old when her people fell into the hand of the enemy and none did help her the adversaries saw her and did mock at her sabbaths
jerusalem hath grievously sinned therefore she is removed all that honoured her despise her because they have seen her nakedness yea she sigheth and turneth backward
her filthiness is in her skirts she remembereth not her last end therefore she came down wonderfully she had no comforter o lord behold my affliction for the enemy hath magnified himself
the adversary hath spread out his hand upon all her pleasant things for she hath seen that the heathen entered into her sanctuary whom thou didst command that they should not enter into thy congregation
all her people sigh they seek bread they have given their pleasant things for meat to relieve the soul see o lord and consider for i am become vile
is it nothing to you all ye that pass by behold and see if there be any sorrow like unto my sorrow which is done unto me wherewith the lord hath afflicted me in the day of his fierce anger
from above hath he sent fire into my bones and it prevaileth against them he hath spread a net for my feet he hath turned me back he hath made me desolate and faint all the day
the yoke of my transgressions is bound by his hand they are wreathed and come up upon my neck he hath made my strength to fall the lord hath delivered me into their hands from whom i am not able to rise up
the lord hath trodden under foot all my mighty men in the midst of me he hath called an assembly against me to crush my young men the lord hath trodden the virgin the daughter of judah as in a winepress
for these things i weep mine eye mine eye runneth down with water because the comforter that should relieve my soul is far from me my children are desolate because the enemy prevailed
zion spreadeth forth her hands and there is none to comfort her the lord hath commanded concerning jacob that his adversaries should be round about him jerusalem is as a menstruous woman among them
the lord is righteous for i have rebelled against his commandment hear i pray you all people and behold my sorrow my virgins and my young men are gone into captivity
i called for my lovers but they deceived me my priests and mine elders gave up the ghost in the city while they sought their meat to relieve their souls
behold o lord for i am in distress my bowels are troubled mine heart is turned within me for i have grievously rebelled abroad the sword bereaveth at home there is as death
they have heard that i sigh there is none to comfort me all mine enemies have heard of my trouble they are glad that thou hast done it thou wilt bring the day that thou hast called and they shall be like unto me
let all their wickedness come before thee and do unto them as thou hast done unto me for all my transgressions for my sighs are many and my heart is faint
how hath the lord covered the daughter of zion with a cloud in his anger and cast down from heaven unto the earth the beauty of israel and remembered not his footstool in the day of his anger
the lord hath swallowed up all the habitations of jacob and hath not pitied he hath thrown down in his wrath the strong holds of the daughter of judah he hath brought them down to the ground he hath polluted the kingdom and the princes thereof
he hath cut off in his fierce anger all the horn of israel he hath drawn back his right hand from before the enemy and he burned against jacob like a flaming fire which devoureth round about
he hath bent his bow like an enemy he stood with his right hand as an adversary and slew all that were pleasant to the eye in the tabernacle of the daughter of zion he poured out his fury like fire
the lord was as an enemy he hath swallowed up israel he hath swallowed up all her palaces he hath destroyed his strong holds and hath increased in the daughter of judah mourning and lamentation
and he hath violently taken away his tabernacle as if it were of a garden he hath destroyed his places of the assembly the lord hath caused the solemn feasts and sabbaths to be forgotten in zion and hath despised in the indignation of his anger the king and the priest
the lord hath cast off his altar he hath abhorred his sanctuary he hath given up into the hand of the enemy the walls of her palaces they have made a noise in the house of the lord as in the day of a solemn feast
the lord hath purposed to destroy the wall of the daughter of zion he hath stretched out a line he hath not withdrawn his hand from destroying therefore he made the rampart and the wall to lament they languished together
her gates are sunk into the ground he hath destroyed and broken her bars her king and her princes are among the gentiles the law is no more her prophets also find no vision from the lord
the elders of the daughter of zion sit upon the ground and keep silence they have cast up dust upon their heads they have girded themselves with sackcloth the virgins of jerusalem hang down their heads to the ground
mine eyes do fail with tears my bowels are troubled my liver is poured upon the earth for the destruction of the daughter of my people because the children and the sucklings swoon in the streets of the city
they say to their mothers where is corn and wine when they swooned as the wounded in the streets of the city when their soul was poured out into their mothers bosom
what thing shall i take to witness for thee what thing shall i liken to thee o daughter of jerusalem what shall i equal to thee that i may comfort thee o virgin daughter of zion for thy breach is great like the sea who can heal thee
thy prophets have seen vain and foolish things for thee and they have not discovered thine iniquity to turn away thy captivity but have seen for thee false burdens and causes of banishment
all that pass by clap their hands at thee they hiss and wag their head at the daughter of jerusalem saying is this the city that men call the perfection of beauty the joy of the whole earth
all thine enemies have opened their mouth against thee they hiss and gnash the teeth they say we have swallowed her up certainly this is the day that we looked for we have found we have seen it
the lord hath done that which he had devised he hath fulfilled his word that he had commanded in the days of old he hath thrown down and hath not pitied and he hath caused thine enemy to rejoice over thee he hath set up the horn of thine adversaries
their heart cried unto the lord o wall of the daughter of zion let tears run down like a river day and night give thyself no rest let not the apple of thine eye cease
arise cry out in the night in the beginning of the watches pour out thine heart like water before the face of the lord lift up thy hands toward him for the life of thy young children that faint for hunger in the top of every street
behold o lord and consider to whom thou hast done this shall the women eat their fruit and children of a span long shall the priest and the prophet be slain in the sanctuary of the lord
the young and the old lie on the ground in the streets my virgins and my young men are fallen by the sword thou hast slain them in the day of thine anger thou hast killed and not pitied
thou hast called as in a solemn day my terrors round about so that in the day of the lord's anger none escaped nor remained those that i have swaddled and brought up hath mine enemy consumed
i am the man that hath seen affliction by the rod of his wrath
he hath led me and brought me into darkness but not into light
surely against me is he turned he turneth his hand against me all the day
my flesh and my skin hath he made old he hath broken my bones
he hath builded against me and compassed me with gall and travail
he hath set me in dark places as they that be dead of old
he hath hedged me about that i cannot get out he hath made my chain heavy
also when i cry and shout he shutteth out my prayer
he hath inclosed my ways with hewn stone he hath made my paths crooked
he was unto me as a bear lying in wait and as a lion in secret places
he hath turned aside my ways and pulled me in pieces he hath made me desolate
he hath bent his bow and set me as a mark for the arrow
he hath caused the arrows of his quiver to enter into my reins
i was a derision to all my people and their song all the day
he hath filled me with bitterness he hath made me drunken with wormwood
he hath also broken my teeth with gravel stones he hath covered me with ashes
and thou hast removed my soul far off from peace i forgat prosperity
and i said my strength and my hope is perished from the lord
remembering mine affliction and my misery the wormwood and the gall
my soul hath them still in remembrance and is humbled in me
this i recall to my mind therefore have i hope
it is of the lord's mercies that we are not consumed because his compassions fail not
they are new every morning great is thy faithfulness
the lord is my portion saith my soul therefore will i hope in him
the lord is good unto them that wait for him to the soul that seeketh him
it is good that a man should both hope and quietly wait for the salvation of the lord
it is good for a man that he bear the yoke in his youth
he sitteth alone and keepeth silence because he hath borne it upon him
he putteth his mouth in the dust if so be there may be hope
he giveth his cheek to him that smiteth him he is filled full with reproach
for the lord will not cast off for ever
but though he cause grief yet will he have compassion according to the multitude of his mercies
for he doth not afflict willingly nor grieve the children of men
to crush under his feet all the prisoners of the earth
to turn aside the right of a man before the face of the most high
to subvert a man in his cause the lord approveth not
who is he that saith and it cometh to pass when the lord commandeth it not
out of the mouth of the most high proceedeth not evil and good
wherefore doth a living man complain a man for the punishment of his sins
let us search and try our ways and turn again to the lord
let us lift up our heart with our hands unto god in the heavens
we have transgressed and have rebelled thou hast not pardoned
thou hast covered with anger and persecuted us thou hast slain thou hast not pitied
