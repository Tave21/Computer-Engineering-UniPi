act ii
scene i saint alban's
 enter king henry vi queen margaret gloucester
 cardinal and suffolk with falconers halloing
queen margaret believe me lords for flying at the brook
 i saw not better sport these seven years day
 yet by your leave the wind was very high
 and ten to one old joan had not gone out
king henry vi but what a point my lord your falcon made
 and what a pitch she flew above the rest
 to see how god in all his creatures works
 yea man and birds are fain of climbing high
suffolk no marvel an it like your majesty
 my lord protector's hawks do tower so well
 they know their master loves to be aloft
 and bears his thoughts above his falcon's pitch
gloucester my lord tis but a base ignoble mind
 that mounts no higher than a bird can soar
cardinal i thought as much he would be above the clouds
gloucester ay my lord cardinal how think you by that
 were it not good your grace could fly to heaven
king henry vi the treasury of everlasting joy
cardinal thy heaven is on earth thine eyes and thoughts
 beat on a crown the treasure of thy heart
 pernicious protector dangerous peer
 that smooth'st it so with king and commonweal
gloucester what cardinal is your priesthood grown peremptory
 tantaene animis coelestibus irae
 churchmen so hot good uncle hide such malice
 with such holiness can you do it
suffolk no malice sir no more than well becomes
 so good a quarrel and so bad a peer
gloucester as who my lord
suffolk why as you my lord
 an't like your lordly lordprotectorship
gloucester why suffolk england knows thine insolence
queen margaret and thy ambition gloucester
king henry vi i prithee peace good queen
 and whet not on these furious peers
 for blessed are the peacemakers on earth
cardinal let me be blessed for the peace i make
 against this proud protector with my sword
