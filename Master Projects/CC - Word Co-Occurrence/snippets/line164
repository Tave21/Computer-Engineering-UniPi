 should my performance perish
silius thou hast ventidius
 that
 without the which a soldier and his sword
 grants scarce distinction thou wilt write to antony
ventidius i'll humbly signify what in his name
 that magical word of war we have effected
 how with his banners and his wellpaid ranks
 the ne'eryetbeaten horse of parthia
 we have jaded out o the field
silius where is he now
ventidius he purposeth to athens whither with what haste
 the weight we must convey with's will permit
 we shall appear before him on there pass along
