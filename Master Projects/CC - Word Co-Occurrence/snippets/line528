katharina ay if the fool could find it where it lies
petruchio who knows not where a wasp does
 wear his sting in his tail
katharina in his tongue
petruchio whose tongue
katharina yours if you talk of tails and so farewell
petruchio what with my tongue in your tail nay come again
 good kate i am a gentleman
katharina that i'll try
 she strikes him
petruchio i swear i'll cuff you if you strike again
katharina so may you lose your arms
 if you strike me you are no gentleman
 and if no gentleman why then no arms
petruchio a herald kate o put me in thy books
katharina what is your crest a coxcomb
petruchio a combless cock so kate will be my hen
katharina no cock of mine you crow too like a craven
petruchio nay come kate come you must not look so sour
katharina it is my fashion when i see a crab
petruchio why here's no crab and therefore look not sour
katharina there is there is
petruchio then show it me
katharina had i a glass i would
petruchio what you mean my face
katharina well aim'd of such a young one
petruchio now by saint george i am too young for you
katharina yet you are wither'd
petruchio tis with cares
katharina i care not
petruchio nay hear you kate in sooth you scape not so
katharina i chafe you if i tarry let me go
petruchio no not a whit i find you passing gentle
 twas told me you were rough and coy and sullen
 and now i find report a very liar
 for thou are pleasant gamesome passing courteous
 but slow in speech yet sweet as springtime flowers
 thou canst not frown thou canst not look askance
 nor bite the lip as angry wenches will
 nor hast thou pleasure to be cross in talk
 but thou with mildness entertain'st thy wooers
 with gentle conference soft and affable
 why does the world report that kate doth limp
 o slanderous world kate like the hazeltwig
 is straight and slender and as brown in hue
 as hazel nuts and sweeter than the kernels
 o let me see thee walk thou dost not halt
katharina go fool and whom thou keep'st command
petruchio did ever dian so become a grove
 as kate this chamber with her princely gait
 o be thou dian and let her be kate
 and then let kate be chaste and dian sportful
katharina where did you study all this goodly speech
petruchio it is extempore from my motherwit
katharina a witty mother witless else her son
petruchio am i not wise
katharina yes keep you warm
petruchio marry so i mean sweet katharina in thy bed
 and therefore setting all this chat aside
 thus in plain terms your father hath consented
 that you shall be my wife your dowry greed on
 and will you nill you i will marry you
 now kate i am a husband for your turn
 for by this light whereby i see thy beauty
 thy beauty that doth make me like thee well
 thou must be married to no man but me
 for i am he am born to tame you kate
 and bring you from a wild kate to a kate
 conformable as other household kates
 here comes your father never make denial
 i must and will have katharina to my wife
 reenter baptista gremio and tranio
baptista now signior petruchio how speed you with my daughter
petruchio how but well sir how but well
 it were impossible i should speed amiss
baptista why how now daughter katharina in your dumps
katharina call you me daughter now i promise you
 you have show'd a tender fatherly regard
 to wish me wed to one half lunatic
 a madcup ruffian and a swearing jack
 that thinks with oaths to face the matter out
petruchio father tis thus yourself and all the world
 that talk'd of her have talk'd amiss of her
 if she be curst it is for policy
 for she's not froward but modest as the dove
 she is not hot but temperate as the morn
 for patience she will prove a second grissel
 and roman lucrece for her chastity
 and to conclude we have greed so well together
 that upon sunday is the weddingday
katharina i'll see thee hang'd on sunday first
gremio hark petruchio she says she'll see thee
 hang'd first
tranio is this your speeding nay then good night our part
petruchio be patient gentlemen i choose her for myself
 if she and i be pleased what's that to you
 tis bargain'd twixt us twain being alone
 that she shall still be curst in company
 i tell you tis incredible to believe
 how much she loves me o the kindest kate
 she hung about my neck and kiss on kiss
 she vied so fast protesting oath on oath
 that in a twink she won me to her love
 o you are novices tis a world to see
 how tame when men and women are alone
 a meacock wretch can make the curstest shrew
 give me thy hand kate i will unto venice
 to buy apparel gainst the weddingday
 provide the feast father and bid the guests
 i will be sure my katharina shall be fine
baptista i know not what to say but give me your hands
 god send you joy petruchio tis a match
gremio 
 amen say we we will be witnesses
tranio 
petruchio father and wife and gentlemen adieu
 i will to venice sunday comes apace
 we will have rings and things and fine array
 and kiss me kate we will be married o'sunday
 exeunt petruchio and katharina severally
gremio was ever match clapp'd up so suddenly
baptista faith gentlemen now i play a merchant's part
 and venture madly on a desperate mart
tranio twas a commodity lay fretting by you
 twill bring you gain or perish on the seas
baptista the gain i seek is quiet in the match
gremio no doubt but he hath got a quiet catch
 but now baptists to your younger daughter
 now is the day we long have looked for
 i am your neighbour and was suitor first
tranio and i am one that love bianca more
 than words can witness or your thoughts can guess
gremio youngling thou canst not love so dear as i
tranio graybeard thy love doth freeze
gremio but thine doth fry
 skipper stand back tis age that nourisheth
tranio but youth in ladies eyes that flourisheth
baptista content you gentlemen i will compound this strife
 tis deeds must win the prize and he of both
 that can assure my daughter greatest dower
 shall have my bianca's love
 say signior gremio what can you assure her
gremio first as you know my house within the city
 is richly furnished with plate and gold
 basins and ewers to lave her dainty hands
 my hangings all of tyrian tapestry
 in ivory coffers i have stuff'd my crowns
 in cypress chests my arras counterpoints
 costly apparel tents and canopies
 fine linen turkey cushions boss'd with pearl
 valance of venice gold in needlework
 pewter and brass and all things that belong
 to house or housekeeping then at my farm
 i have a hundred milchkine to the pail
 sixscore fat oxen standing in my stalls
 and all things answerable to this portion
 myself am struck in years i must confess
 and if i die tomorrow this is hers
 if whilst i live she will be only mine
tranio that only came well in sir list to me
 i am my father's heir and only son
 if i may have your daughter to my wife
 i'll leave her houses three or four as good
 within rich pisa walls as any one
 old signior gremio has in padua
 besides two thousand ducats by the year
 of fruitful land all which shall be her jointure
 what have i pinch'd you signior gremio
gremio two thousand ducats by the year of land
 my land amounts not to so much in all
 that she shall have besides an argosy
 that now is lying in marseilles road
 what have i choked you with an argosy
tranio gremio tis known my father hath no less
 than three great argosies besides two galliases
 and twelve tight galleys these i will assure her
 and twice as much whate'er thou offer'st next
gremio nay i have offer'd all i have no more
 and she can have no more than all i have
 if you like me she shall have me and mine
tranio why then the maid is mine from all the world
 by your firm promise gremio is outvied
baptista i must confess your offer is the best
 and let your father make her the assurance
 she is your own else you must pardon me
 if you should die before him where's her dower
tranio that's but a cavil he is old i young
gremio and may not young men die as well as old
baptista well gentlemen
 i am thus resolved on sunday next you know
 my daughter katharina is to be married
 now on the sunday following shall bianca
 be bride to you if you this assurance
 if not signior gremio
 and so i take my leave and thank you both
gremio adieu good neighbour
 exit baptista

 sirrah young gamester your father were a fool
 to give thee all and in his waning age
