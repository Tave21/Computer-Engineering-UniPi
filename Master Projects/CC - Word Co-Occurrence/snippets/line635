 but he shall know i am as good
gloucester as good
 thou bastard of my grandfather
bishop
of winchester ay lordly sir for what are you i pray
 but one imperious in another's throne
gloucester am i not protector saucy priest
bishop
of winchester and am not i a prelate of the church
gloucester yes as an outlaw in a castle keeps
 and useth it to patronage his theft
bishop
of winchester unreverent gloster
gloucester thou art reverent
 touching thy spiritual function not thy life
bishop
of winchester rome shall remedy this
warwick roam thither then
somerset my lord it were your duty to forbear
warwick ay see the bishop be not overborne
somerset methinks my lord should be religious
 and know the office that belongs to such
warwick methinks his lordship should be humbler
 it fitteth not a prelate so to plead
somerset yes when his holy state is touch'd so near
warwick state holy or unhallow'd what of that
 is not his grace protector to the king
richard
plantagenet aside plantagenet i see must hold his tongue
 lest it be said speak sirrah when you should
 must your bold verdict enter talk with lords'
 else would i have a fling at winchester
king henry vi uncles of gloucester and of winchester
 the special watchmen of our english weal
 i would prevail if prayers might prevail
 to join your hearts in love and amity
 o what a scandal is it to our crown
 that two such noble peers as ye should jar
 believe me lords my tender years can tell
 civil dissension is a viperous worm
 that gnaws the bowels of the commonwealth
 a noise within down with the tawnycoats'
 what tumult's this
warwick an uproar i dare warrant
 begun through malice of the bishop's men
 a noise again stones stones enter mayor
mayor o my good lords and virtuous henry
 pity the city of london pity us
 the bishop and the duke of gloucester's men
 forbidden late to carry any weapon
 have fill'd their pockets full of pebble stones
 and banding themselves in contrary parts
 do pelt so fast at one another's pate
 that many have their giddy brains knock'd out
 our windows are broke down in every street
 and we for fear compell'd to shut our shops
 enter servingmen in skirmish with bloody pates
king henry vi we charge you on allegiance to ourself
 to hold your slaughtering hands and keep the peace
 pray uncle gloucester mitigate this strife
first servingman nay if we be forbidden stones
 we'll fall to it with our teeth
second servingman do what ye dare we are as resolute
 skirmish again
gloucester you of my household leave this peevish broil
 and set this unaccustom'd fight aside
third servingman my lord we know your grace to be a man
 just and upright and for your royal birth
 inferior to none but to his majesty
 and ere that we will suffer such a prince
 so kind a father of the commonweal
 to be disgraced by an inkhorn mate
 we and our wives and children all will fight
 and have our bodies slaughtered by thy foes
first servingman ay and the very parings of our nails
 shall pitch a field when we are dead
 begin again
gloucester stay stay i say
 and if you love me as you say you do
 let me persuade you to forbear awhile
king henry vi o how this discord doth afflict my soul
 can you my lord of winchester behold
 my sighs and tears and will not once relent
 who should be pitiful if you be not
 or who should study to prefer a peace
 if holy churchmen take delight in broils
warwick yield my lord protector yield winchester
 except you mean with obstinate repulse
 to slay your sovereign and destroy the realm
 you see what mischief and what murder too
 hath been enacted through your enmity
 then be at peace except ye thirst for blood
bishop
of winchester he shall submit or i will never yield
gloucester compassion on the king commands me stoop
 or i would see his heart out ere the priest
 should ever get that privilege of me
warwick behold my lord of winchester the duke
 hath banish'd moody discontented fury
 as by his smoothed brows it doth appear
 why look you still so stern and tragical
gloucester here winchester i offer thee my hand
king henry vi fie uncle beaufort i have heard you preach
 that malice was a great and grievous sin
 and will not you maintain the thing you teach
 but prove a chief offender in the same
warwick sweet king the bishop hath a kindly gird
 for shame my lord of winchester relent
 what shall a child instruct you what to do
bishop
of winchester well duke of gloucester i will yield to thee
 love for thy love and hand for hand i give
gloucester aside ay but i fear me with a hollow heart
 see here my friends and loving countrymen
 this token serveth for a flag of truce
 betwixt ourselves and all our followers
 so help me god as i dissemble not
bishop
of winchester aside so help me god as i intend it not
king henry vi o loving uncle kind duke of gloucester
 how joyful am i made by this contract
 away my masters trouble us no more
 but join in friendship as your lords have done
first servingman content i'll to the surgeon's
second servingman and so will i
third servingman and i will see what physic the tavern affords
 exeunt servingmen mayor &c
warwick accept this scroll most gracious sovereign
 which in the right of richard plantagenet
 we do exhibit to your majesty
gloucester well urged my lord of warwick or sweet prince
 and if your grace mark every circumstance
 you have great reason to do richard right
 especially for those occasions
 at eltham place i told your majesty
king henry vi and those occasions uncle were of force
 therefore my loving lords our pleasure is
 that richard be restored to his blood
warwick let richard be restored to his blood
 so shall his father's wrongs be recompensed
bishop
of winchester as will the rest so willeth winchester
king henry vi if richard will be true not that alone
 but all the whole inheritance i give
 that doth belong unto the house of york
 from whence you spring by lineal descent
richard
plantagenet thy humble servant vows obedience
 and humble service till the point of death
king henry vi stoop then and set your knee against my foot
 and in reguerdon of that duty done
 i gird thee with the valiant sword of york
 rise richard like a true plantagenet
 and rise created princely duke of york
richard
plantagenet and so thrive richard as thy foes may fall
 and as my duty springs so perish they
 that grudge one thought against your majesty
all welcome high prince the mighty duke of york
somerset aside perish base prince ignoble duke of york
gloucester now will it best avail your majesty
 to cross the seas and to be crown'd in france
 the presence of a king engenders love
 amongst his subjects and his loyal friends
 as it disanimates his enemies
king henry vi when gloucester says the word king henry goes
 for friendly counsel cuts off many foes
gloucester your ships already are in readiness
 sennet flourish exeunt all but exeter
exeter ay we may march in england or in france
 not seeing what is likely to ensue
 this late dissension grown betwixt the peers
 burns under feigned ashes of forged love
 and will at last break out into a flame
 as fester'd members rot but by degree
 till bones and flesh and sinews fall away
 so will this base and envious discord breed
 and now i fear that fatal prophecy
 which in the time of henry named the fifth
 was in the mouth of every sucking babe
 that henry born at monmouth should win all
 and henry born at windsor lose all
 which is so plain that exeter doth wish
 his days may finish ere that hapless time
 exit
 1 king henry vi
act iii
scene ii france before rouen
 enter joan la pucelle disguised with four soldiers
 with sacks upon their backs
joan la pucelle these are the city gates the gates of rouen
 through which our policy must make a breach
 take heed be wary how you place your words
 talk like the vulgar sort of market men
 that come to gather money for their corn
 if we have entrance as i hope we shall
 and that we find the slothful watch but weak
 i'll by a sign give notice to our friends
 that charles the dauphin may encounter them
first soldier our sacks shall be a mean to sack the city
