 meddle with no tradesman's matters nor women's
 matters but with awl i am indeed sir a surgeon
 to old shoes when they are in great danger i
 recover them as proper men as ever trod upon
 neat's leather have gone upon my handiwork
flavius but wherefore art not in thy shop today
 why dost thou lead these men about the streets
second commoner truly sir to wear out their shoes to get myself
 into more work but indeed sir we make holiday
 to see caesar and to rejoice in his triumph
marullus wherefore rejoice what conquest brings he home
 what tributaries follow him to rome
 to grace in captive bonds his chariotwheels
 you blocks you stones you worse than senseless things
 o you hard hearts you cruel men of rome
 knew you not pompey many a time and oft
 have you climb'd up to walls and battlements
 to towers and windows yea to chimneytops
 your infants in your arms and there have sat
 the livelong day with patient expectation
 to see great pompey pass the streets of rome
 and when you saw his chariot but appear
 have you not made an universal shout
 that tiber trembled underneath her banks
 to hear the replication of your sounds
 made in her concave shores
 and do you now put on your best attire
 and do you now cull out a holiday
 and do you now strew flowers in his way
 that comes in triumph over pompey's blood be gone
 run to your houses fall upon your knees
 pray to the gods to intermit the plague
 that needs must light on this ingratitude
flavius go go good countrymen and for this fault
 assemble all the poor men of your sort
 draw them to tiber banks and weep your tears
 into the channel till the lowest stream
 do kiss the most exalted shores of all
 exeunt all the commoners
 see whether their basest metal be not moved
 they vanish tonguetied in their guiltiness
 go you down that way towards the capitol
 this way will i disrobe the images
 if you do find them deck'd with ceremonies
marullus may we do so
 you know it is the feast of lupercal
flavius it is no matter let no images
 be hung with caesar's trophies i'll about
 and drive away the vulgar from the streets
 so do you too where you perceive them thick
 these growing feathers pluck'd from caesar's wing
 will make him fly an ordinary pitch
 who else would soar above the view of men
 and keep us all in servile fearfulness

caesar forget not in your speed antonius
 to touch calpurnia for our elders say
 the barren touched in this holy chase

antony i shall remember
 when caesar says do this it is perform'd
caesar set on and leave no ceremony out

soothsayer caesar
caesar ha who calls
casca bid every noise be still peace yet again
caesar who is it in the press that calls on me
 i hear a tongue shriller than all the music
 cry caesar speak caesar is turn'd to hear
soothsayer beware the ides of march
caesar what man is that
brutus a soothsayer bids you beware the ides of march
caesar set him before me let me see his face
cassius fellow come from the throng look upon caesar
caesar what say'st thou to me now speak once again
soothsayer beware the ides of march
caesar he is a dreamer let us leave him pass
 sennet exeunt all except brutus and cassius
cassius will you go see the order of the course
brutus not i
cassius i pray you do
brutus i am not gamesome i do lack some part
 of that quick spirit that is in antony
 let me not hinder cassius your desires
 i'll leave you
cassius brutus i do observe you now of late
 i have not from your eyes that gentleness
 and show of love as i was wont to have
 you bear too stubborn and too strange a hand
 over your friend that loves you
brutus cassius
 be not deceived if i have veil'd my look
 i turn the trouble of my countenance
 merely upon myself vexed i am
 of late with passions of some difference
 conceptions only proper to myself
 which give some soil perhaps to my behaviors
 but let not therefore my good friends be grieved
 among which number cassius be you one
 nor construe any further my neglect
 than that poor brutus with himself at war
 forgets the shows of love to other men
cassius then brutus i have much mistook your passion
 by means whereof this breast of mine hath buried
 thoughts of great value worthy cogitations
 tell me good brutus can you see your face
brutus no cassius for the eye sees not itself
 but by reflection by some other things
cassius tis just
 and it is very much lamented brutus
 that you have no such mirrors as will turn
 your hidden worthiness into your eye
 that you might see your shadow i have heard
 where many of the best respect in rome
 except immortal caesar speaking of brutus
 and groaning underneath this age's yoke
 have wish'd that noble brutus had his eyes
brutus into what dangers would you lead me cassius
 that you would have me seek into myself
 for that which is not in me
cassius therefore good brutus be prepared to hear
 and since you know you cannot see yourself
 so well as by reflection i your glass
 will modestly discover to yourself
 that of yourself which you yet know not of
 and be not jealous on me gentle brutus
 were i a common laugher or did use
 to stale with ordinary oaths my love
 to every new protester if you know
 that i do fawn on men and hug them hard
 and after scandal them or if you know
 that i profess myself in banqueting
 to all the rout then hold me dangerous
 flourish and shout
brutus what means this shouting i do fear the people
 choose caesar for their king
cassius ay do you fear it
 then must i think you would not have it so
brutus i would not cassius yet i love him well
 but wherefore do you hold me here so long
 what is it that you would impart to me
 if it be aught toward the general good
 set honour in one eye and death i the other
 and i will look on both indifferently
 for let the gods so speed me as i love
 the name of honour more than i fear death
cassius i know that virtue to be in you brutus
 as well as i do know your outward favour
 well honour is the subject of my story
 i cannot tell what you and other men
 think of this life but for my single self
 i had as lief not be as live to be
 in awe of such a thing as i myself
 i was born free as caesar so were you
 we both have fed as well and we can both
 endure the winter's cold as well as he
 for once upon a raw and gusty day
 the troubled tiber chafing with her shores
 caesar said to me darest thou cassius now
 leap in with me into this angry flood
 and swim to yonder point upon the word
 accoutred as i was i plunged in
 and bade him follow so indeed he did
 the torrent roar'd and we did buffet it
 with lusty sinews throwing it aside
 and stemming it with hearts of controversy
 but ere we could arrive the point proposed
 caesar cried help me cassius or i sink'
 i as aeneas our great ancestor
 did from the flames of troy upon his shoulder
 the old anchises bear so from the waves of tiber
 did i the tired caesar and this man
 is now become a god and cassius is
 a wretched creature and must bend his body
 if caesar carelessly but nod on him
 he had a fever when he was in spain
 and when the fit was on him i did mark
 how he did shake tis true this god did shake
 his coward lips did from their colour fly
 and that same eye whose bend doth awe the world
 did lose his lustre i did hear him groan
 ay and that tongue of his that bade the romans
 mark him and write his speeches in their books
 alas it cried give me some drink titinius'
 as a sick girl ye gods it doth amaze me
 a man of such a feeble temper should
