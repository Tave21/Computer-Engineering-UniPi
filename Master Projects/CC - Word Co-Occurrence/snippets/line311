 so are they all for every grise of fortune
 is smooth'd by that below the learned pate
 ducks to the golden fool all is oblique
 there's nothing level in our cursed natures
 but direct villany therefore be abhorr'd
 all feasts societies and throngs of men
 his semblable yea himself timon disdains
 destruction fang mankind earth yield me roots
 digging
 who seeks for better of thee sauce his palate
 with thy most operant poison what is here
 gold yellow glittering precious gold no gods
 i am no idle votarist roots you clear heavens
 thus much of this will make black white foul fair
 wrong right base noble old young coward valiant
 ha you gods why this what this you gods why this
 will lug your priests and servants from your sides
 pluck stout men's pillows from below their heads
 this yellow slave
 will knit and break religions bless the accursed
 make the hoar leprosy adored place thieves
 and give them title knee and approbation
 with senators on the bench this is it
 that makes the wappen'd widow wed again
 she whom the spitalhouse and ulcerous sores
 would cast the gorge at this embalms and spices
 to the april day again come damned earth
 thou common whore of mankind that put'st odds
 among the route of nations i will make thee
 do thy right nature
 march afar off
 ha a drum thou'rt quick
 but yet i'll bury thee thou'lt go strong thief
 when gouty keepers of thee cannot stand
 nay stay thou out for earnest
 keeping some gold
 enter alcibiades with drum and fife in
 warlike manner phrynia and timandra
alcibiades what art thou there speak
timon a beast as thou art the canker gnaw thy heart
 for showing me again the eyes of man
alcibiades what is thy name is man so hateful to thee
 that art thyself a man
timon i am misanthropos and hate mankind
 for thy part i do wish thou wert a dog
 that i might love thee something
alcibiades i know thee well
 but in thy fortunes am unlearn'd and strange
timon i know thee too and more than that i know thee
 i not desire to know follow thy drum
 with man's blood paint the ground gules gules
 religious canons civil laws are cruel
 then what should war be this fell whore of thine
 hath in her more destruction than thy sword
 for all her cherubim look
phrynia thy lips rot off
timon i will not kiss thee then the rot returns
 to thine own lips again
alcibiades how came the noble timon to this change
timon as the moon does by wanting light to give
 but then renew i could not like the moon
 there were no suns to borrow of
alcibiades noble timon
 what friendship may i do thee
timon none but to
 maintain my opinion
alcibiades what is it timon
timon promise me friendship but perform none if thou
 wilt not promise the gods plague thee for thou art
 a man if thou dost perform confound thee for
 thou art a man
alcibiades i have heard in some sort of thy miseries
timon thou saw'st them when i had prosperity
alcibiades i see them now then was a blessed time
timon as thine is now held with a brace of harlots
timandra is this the athenian minion whom the world
 voiced so regardfully
timon art thou timandra
timandra yes
timon be a whore still they love thee not that use thee
 give them diseases leaving with thee their lust
 make use of thy salt hours season the slaves
 for tubs and baths bring down rosecheeked youth
 to the tubfast and the diet
timandra hang thee monster
alcibiades pardon him sweet timandra for his wits
 are drown'd and lost in his calamities
 i have but little gold of late brave timon
 the want whereof doth daily make revolt
 in my penurious band i have heard and grieved
 how cursed athens mindless of thy worth
 forgetting thy great deeds when neighbour states
 but for thy sword and fortune trod upon them
timon i prithee beat thy drum and get thee gone
alcibiades i am thy friend and pity thee dear timon
timon how dost thou pity him whom thou dost trouble
 i had rather be alone
alcibiades why fare thee well
 here is some gold for thee
timon keep it i cannot eat it
alcibiades when i have laid proud athens on a heap
timon warr'st thou gainst athens
alcibiades ay timon and have cause
timon the gods confound them all in thy conquest
 and thee after when thou hast conquer'd
alcibiades why me timon
timon that by killing of villains
 thou wast born to conquer my country
 put up thy gold go onhere's goldgo on
 be as a planetary plague when jove
 will o'er some highviced city hang his poison
 in the sick air let not thy sword skip one
 pity not honour'd age for his white beard
 he is an usurer strike me the counterfeit matron
 it is her habit only that is honest
 herself's a bawd let not the virgin's cheek
 make soft thy trenchant sword for those milkpaps
 that through the windowbars bore at men's eyes
 are not within the leaf of pity writ
 but set them down horrible traitors spare not the babe
 whose dimpled smiles from fools exhaust their mercy
 think it a bastard whom the oracle
 hath doubtfully pronounced thy throat shall cut
 and mince it sans remorse swear against objects
 put armour on thine ears and on thine eyes
 whose proof nor yells of mothers maids nor babes
 nor sight of priests in holy vestments bleeding
 shall pierce a jot there's gold to pay soldiers
 make large confusion and thy fury spent
 confounded be thyself speak not be gone
alcibiades hast thou gold yet i'll take the gold thou
 givest me
 not all thy counsel
timon dost thou or dost thou not heaven's curse
 upon thee
phrynia 
 give us some gold good timon hast thou more
timandra 
timon enough to make a whore forswear her trade
 and to make whores a bawd hold up you sluts
 your aprons mountant you are not oathable
 although i know you ll swear terribly swear
 into strong shudders and to heavenly agues
 the immortal gods that hear youspare your oaths
 i'll trust to your conditions be whores still
 and he whose pious breath seeks to convert you
 be strong in whore allure him burn him up
 let your close fire predominate his smoke
 and be no turncoats yet may your pains six months
 be quite contrary and thatch your poor thin roofs
 with burthens of the deadsome that were hang'd
 no matterwear them betray with them whore still
 paint till a horse may mire upon your face
 a pox of wrinkles
phrynia 
 well more gold what then
timandra believe't that we'll do any thing for gold
timon consumptions sow
 in hollow bones of man strike their sharp shins
 and mar men's spurring crack the lawyer's voice
 that he may never more false title plead
 nor sound his quillets shrilly hoar the flamen
 that scolds against the quality of flesh
 and not believes himself down with the nose
 down with it flat take the bridge quite away
 of him that his particular to foresee
 smells from the general weal make curl'dpate
 ruffians bald
 and let the unscarr'd braggarts of the war
 derive some pain from you plague all
 that your activity may defeat and quell
 the source of all erection there's more gold
 do you damn others and let this damn you
 and ditches grave you all
phrynia 
 more counsel with more money bounteous timon
timandra 
timon more whore more mischief first i have given you earnest
alcibiades strike up the drum towards athens farewell timon
 if i thrive well i'll visit thee again
timon if i hope well i'll never see thee more
alcibiades i never did thee harm
timon yes thou spokest well of me
alcibiades call'st thou that harm
timon men daily find it get thee away and take
 thy beagles with thee
alcibiades we but offend him strike
 drum beats exeunt alcibiades phrynia
 and timandra
timon that nature being sick of man's unkindness
 should yet be hungry common mother thou
 digging
 whose womb unmeasurable and infinite breast
 teems and feeds all whose selfsame mettle
 whereof thy proud child arrogant man is puff'd
 engenders the black toad and adder blue
 the gilded newt and eyeless venom'd worm
 with all the abhorred births below crisp heaven
 whereon hyperion's quickening fire doth shine
 yield him who all thy human sons doth hate
