 for all the rest is held at such a rate
 as brings a thousandfold more care to keep
 than in possession and jot of pleasure
 ah cousin york would thy best friends did know
 how it doth grieve me that thy head is here
queen margaret my lord cheer up your spirits our foes are nigh
 and this soft courage makes your followers faint
 you promised knighthood to our forward son
 unsheathe your sword and dub him presently
 edward kneel down
king henry vi edward plantagenet arise a knight
 and learn this lesson draw thy sword in right
prince my gracious father by your kingly leave
 i'll draw it as apparent to the crown
 and in that quarrel use it to the death
clifford why that is spoken like a toward prince
 enter a messenger
messenger royal commanders be in readiness
 for with a band of thirty thousand men
 comes warwick backing of the duke of york
 and in the towns as they do march along
 proclaims him king and many fly to him
 darraign your battle for they are at hand
clifford i would your highness would depart the field
 the queen hath best success when you are absent
queen margaret ay good my lord and leave us to our fortune
king henry vi why that's my fortune too therefore i'll stay
northumberland be it with resolution then to fight
prince edward my royal father cheer these noble lords
 and hearten those that fight in your defence
 unsheathe your sword good father cry saint george'
 march enter edward george richard warwick
 norfolk montague and soldiers
edward now perjured henry wilt thou kneel for grace
 and set thy diadem upon my head
 or bide the mortal fortune of the field
queen margaret go rate thy minions proud insulting boy
 becomes it thee to be thus bold in terms
 before thy sovereign and thy lawful king
edward i am his king and he should bow his knee
 i was adopted heir by his consent
 since when his oath is broke for as i hear
 you that are king though he do wear the crown
 have caused him by new act of parliament
 to blot out me and put his own son in
clifford and reason too
 who should succeed the father but the son
richard are you there butcher o i cannot speak
clifford ay crookback here i stand to answer thee
 or any he the proudest of thy sort
richard twas you that kill'd young rutland was it not
clifford ay and old york and yet not satisfied
richard for god's sake lords give signal to the fight
warwick what say'st thou henry wilt thou yield the crown
queen margaret why how now longtongued warwick dare you speak
 when you and i met at saint alban's last
 your legs did better service than your hands
warwick then twas my turn to fly and now tis thine
clifford you said so much before and yet you fled
warwick twas not your valour clifford drove me thence
northumberland no nor your manhood that durst make you stay
richard northumberland i hold thee reverently
 break off the parley for scarce i can refrain
 the execution of my bigswoln heart
 upon that clifford that cruel childkiller
clifford i slew thy father call'st thou him a child
richard ay like a dastard and a treacherous coward
 as thou didst kill our tender brother rutland
 but ere sunset i'll make thee curse the deed
king henry vi have done with words my lords and hear me speak
queen margaret defy them then or else hold close thy lips
king henry vi i prithee give no limits to my tongue
 i am a king and privileged to speak
clifford my liege the wound that bred this meeting here
 cannot be cured by words therefore be still
richard then executioner unsheathe thy sword
 by him that made us all i am resolved
 that clifford's manhood lies upon his tongue
edward say henry shall i have my right or no
 a thousand men have broke their fasts today
 that ne'er shall dine unless thou yield the crown
warwick if thou deny their blood upon thy head
 for york in justice puts his armour on
prince edward if that be right which warwick says is right
 there is no wrong but every thing is right
richard whoever got thee there thy mother stands
 for well i wot thou hast thy mother's tongue
queen margaret but thou art neither like thy sire nor dam
 but like a foul misshapen stigmatic
 mark'd by the destinies to be avoided
 as venom toads or lizards dreadful stings
richard iron of naples hid with english gilt
 whose father bears the title of a king
 as if a channel should be call'd the sea
 shamest thou not knowing whence thou art extraught
 to let thy tongue detect thy baseborn heart
edward a wisp of straw were worth a thousand crowns
 to make this shameless callet know herself
 helen of greece was fairer far than thou
 although thy husband may be menelaus
 and ne'er was agamemnon's brother wrong'd
 by that false woman as this king by thee
 his father revell'd in the heart of france
 and tamed the king and made the dauphin stoop
 and had he match'd according to his state
 he might have kept that glory to this day
 but when he took a beggar to his bed
 and graced thy poor sire with his bridalday
 even then that sunshine brew'd a shower for him
 that wash'd his father's fortunes forth of france
 and heap'd sedition on his crown at home
 for what hath broach'd this tumult but thy pride
 hadst thou been meek our title still had slept
 and we in pity of the gentle king
 had slipp'd our claim until another age
george but when we saw our sunshine made thy spring
 and that thy summer bred us no increase
 we set the axe to thy usurping root
 and though the edge hath something hit ourselves
 yet know thou since we have begun to strike
 we'll never leave till we have hewn thee down
 or bathed thy growing with our heated bloods
edward and in this resolution i defy thee
 not willing any longer conference
 since thou deniest the gentle king to speak
 sound trumpets let our bloody colours wave
 and either victory or else a grave
queen margaret stay edward
edward no wrangling woman we'll no longer stay
 these words will cost ten thousand lives this day

scene iii a field of battle between towton and saxton in
 yorkshire
 alarum excursions enter warwick
warwick forspent with toil as runners with a race
 i lay me down a little while to breathe
 for strokes received and many blows repaid
 have robb'd my strongknit sinews of their strength
 and spite of spite needs must i rest awhile
 enter edward running
edward smile gentle heaven or strike ungentle death
 for this world frowns and edward's sun is clouded
warwick how now my lord what hap what hope of good
 enter george
george our hap is loss our hope but sad despair
 our ranks are broke and ruin follows us
 what counsel give you whither shall we fly
edward bootless is flight they follow us with wings
 and weak we are and cannot shun pursuit
 enter richard
richard ah warwick why hast thou withdrawn thyself
 thy brother's blood the thirsty earth hath drunk
 broach'd with the steely point of clifford's lance
 and in the very pangs of death he cried
 like to a dismal clangour heard from far
 warwick revenge brother revenge my death'
 so underneath the belly of their steeds
 that stain'd their fetlocks in his smoking blood
 the noble gentleman gave up the ghost
warwick then let the earth be drunken with our blood
 i'll kill my horse because i will not fly
 why stand we like softhearted women here
 wailing our losses whiles the foe doth rage
 and look upon as if the tragedy
 were play'd in jest by counterfeiting actors
 here on my knee i vow to god above
 i'll never pause again never stand still
 till either death hath closed these eyes of mine
 or fortune given me measure of revenge
edward o warwick i do bend my knee with thine
 and in this vow do chain my soul to thine
 and ere my knee rise from the earth's cold face
 i throw my hands mine eyes my heart to thee
 thou setter up and plucker down of kings
 beseeching thee if with they will it stands
 that to my foes this body must be prey
 yet that thy brazen gates of heaven may ope
 and give sweet passage to my sinful soul
 now lords take leave until we meet again
 where'er it be in heaven or in earth
richard brother give me thy hand and gentle warwick
 let me embrace thee in my weary arms
 i that did never weep now melt with woe
 that winter should cut off our springtime so
warwick away away once more sweet lords farewell
george yet let us all together to our troops
 and give them leave to fly that will not stay
 and call them pillars that will stand to us
 and if we thrive promise them such rewards
 as victors wear at the olympian games
 this may plant courage in their quailing breasts
 for yet is hope of life and victory
 forslow no longer make we hence amain
