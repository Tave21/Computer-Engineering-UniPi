 great p's it is in contempt of question her hand
sir andrew her c's her u's and her t's why that
malvolio reads to the unknown beloved this and my good
 wishes'her very phrases by your leave wax
 soft and the impressure her lucrece with which she
 uses to seal tis my lady to whom should this be
fabian this wins him liver and all
malvolio reads
 jove knows i love but who
 lips do not move
 no man must know
 no man must know what follows the numbers
 altered no man must know if this should be
 thee malvolio
sir toby belch marry hang thee brock
malvolio reads
 i may command where i adore
 but silence like a lucrece knife
 with bloodless stroke my heart doth gore
 m o a i doth sway my life
fabian a fustian riddle
sir toby belch excellent wench say i
malvolio m o a i doth sway my life nay but first let
 me see let me see let me see
fabian what dish o poison has she dressed him
sir toby belch and with what wing the staniel cheques at it
malvolio i may command where i adore why she may command
 me i serve her she is my lady why this is
 evident to any formal capacity there is no
 obstruction in this and the endwhat should
 that alphabetical position portend if i could make
 that resemble something in mesoftly m o a
 i
sir toby belch o ay make up that he is now at a cold scent
fabian sowter will cry upon't for all this though it be as
 rank as a fox
malvolio mmalvolio mwhy that begins my name
fabian did not i say he would work it out the cur is
 excellent at faults
malvolio mbut then there is no consonancy in the sequel
 that suffers under probation a should follow but o does
fabian and o shall end i hope
sir toby belch ay or i'll cudgel him and make him cry o
malvolio and then i comes behind
fabian ay an you had any eye behind you you might see
 more detraction at your heels than fortunes before
 you
malvolio m o a i this simulation is not as the former and
 yet to crush this a little it would bow to me for
 every one of these letters are in my name soft
 here follows prose
 reads
 if this fall into thy hand revolve in my stars i
 am above thee but be not afraid of greatness some
 are born great some achieve greatness and some
 have greatness thrust upon em thy fates open
 their hands let thy blood and spirit embrace them
 and to inure thyself to what thou art like to be
 cast thy humble slough and appear fresh be
 opposite with a kinsman surly with servants let
 thy tongue tang arguments of state put thyself into
 the trick of singularity she thus advises thee
 that sighs for thee remember who commended thy
 yellow stockings and wished to see thee ever
 crossgartered i say remember go to thou art
 made if thou desirest to be so if not let me see
 thee a steward still the fellow of servants and
 not worthy to touch fortune's fingers farewell
 she that would alter services with thee
 the fortunateunhappy'
 daylight and champaign discovers not more this is
 open i will be proud i will read politic authors
 i will baffle sir toby i will wash off gross
 acquaintance i will be pointdevise the very man
 i do not now fool myself to let imagination jade
 me for every reason excites to this that my lady
 loves me she did commend my yellow stockings of
 late she did praise my leg being crossgartered
 and in this she manifests herself to my love and
 with a kind of injunction drives me to these habits
 of her liking i thank my stars i am happy i will
 be strange stout in yellow stockings and
 crossgartered even with the swiftness of putting
 on jove and my stars be praised here is yet a
 postscript
 reads
 thou canst not choose but know who i am if thou
 entertainest my love let it appear in thy smiling
 thy smiles become thee well therefore in my
 presence still smile dear my sweet i prithee'
 jove i thank thee i will smile i will do
 everything that thou wilt have me
 exit
fabian i will not give my part of this sport for a pension
 of thousands to be paid from the sophy
sir toby belch i could marry this wench for this device
sir andrew so could i too
sir toby belch and ask no other dowry with her but such another jest
sir andrew nor i neither
fabian here comes my noble gullcatcher
 reenter maria
sir toby belch wilt thou set thy foot o my neck
sir andrew or o mine either
sir toby belch shall i play my freedom at traytrip and become thy
 bondslave
sir andrew i faith or i either
sir toby belch why thou hast put him in such a dream that when
 the image of it leaves him he must run mad
maria nay but say true does it work upon him
sir toby belch like aquavitae with a midwife
maria if you will then see the fruits of the sport mark
 his first approach before my lady he will come to
 her in yellow stockings and tis a colour she
 abhors and crossgartered a fashion she detests
 and he will smile upon her which will now be so
 unsuitable to her disposition being addicted to a
 melancholy as she is that it cannot but turn him
 into a notable contempt if you will see it follow
 me
sir toby belch to the gates of tartar thou most excellent devil of wit
sir andrew i'll make one too
 exeunt
 twelfth night
act iii
scene i olivia's garden
 enter viola and clown with a tabour
viola save thee friend and thy music dost thou live by
 thy tabour
clown no sir i live by the church
viola art thou a churchman
clown no such matter sir i do live by the church for
 i do live at my house and my house doth stand by
 the church
viola so thou mayst say the king lies by a beggar if a
 beggar dwell near him or the church stands by thy
 tabour if thy tabour stand by the church
clown you have said sir to see this age a sentence is
 but a cheveril glove to a good wit how quickly the
 wrong side may be turned outward
viola nay that's certain they that dally nicely with
 words may quickly make them wanton
clown i would therefore my sister had had no name sir
viola why man
clown why sir her name's a word and to dally with that
 word might make my sister wanton but indeed words
 are very rascals since bonds disgraced them
viola thy reason man
clown troth sir i can yield you none without words and
 words are grown so false i am loath to prove
 reason with them
viola i warrant thou art a merry fellow and carest for nothing
clown not so sir i do care for something but in my
 conscience sir i do not care for you if that be
 to care for nothing sir i would it would make you invisible
viola art not thou the lady olivia's fool
clown no indeed sir the lady olivia has no folly she
 will keep no fool sir till she be married and
 fools are as like husbands as pilchards are to
 herrings the husband's the bigger i am indeed not
 her fool but her corrupter of words
viola i saw thee late at the count orsino's
clown foolery sir does walk about the orb like the sun
 it shines every where i would be sorry sir but
 the fool should be as oft with your master as with
 my mistress i think i saw your wisdom there
viola nay an thou pass upon me i'll no more with thee
 hold there's expenses for thee
clown now jove in his next commodity of hair send thee a beard
viola by my troth i'll tell thee i am almost sick for
 one
 aside
 though i would not have it grow on my chin is thy
 lady within
clown would not a pair of these have bred sir
viola yes being kept together and put to use
clown i would play lord pandarus of phrygia sir to bring
 a cressida to this troilus
viola i understand you sir tis well begged
clown the matter i hope is not great sir begging but
 a beggar cressida was a beggar my lady is
 within sir i will construe to them whence you
 come who you are and what you would are out of my
 welkin i might say element but the word is overworn
 exit
viola this fellow is wise enough to play the fool
 and to do that well craves a kind of wit
 he must observe their mood on whom he jests
 the quality of persons and the time
 and like the haggard cheque at every feather
 that comes before his eye this is a practise
 as full of labour as a wise man's art
 for folly that he wisely shows is fit
 but wise men follyfall'n quite taint their wit
 enter sir toby belch and sir andrew
sir toby belch save you gentleman
viola and you sir
sir andrew dieu vous garde monsieur
viola et vous aussi votre serviteur
sir andrew i hope sir you are and i am yours
sir toby belch will you encounter the house my niece is desirous
