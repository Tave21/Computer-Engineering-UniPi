 you cousin nevil as i may remember
 to warwick
 when richard with his eye brimful of tears
 then cheque'd and rated by northumberland
 did speak these words now proved a prophecy
 northumberland thou ladder by the which
 my cousin bolingbroke ascends my throne'
 though then god knows i had no such intent
 but that necessity so bow'd the state
 that i and greatness were compell'd to kiss
 the time shall come thus did he follow it
 the time will come that foul sin gathering head
 shall break into corruption so went on
 foretelling this same time's condition
 and the division of our amity
warwick there is a history in all men's lives
 figuring the nature of the times deceased
 the which observed a man may prophesy
 with a near aim of the main chance of things
 as yet not come to life which in their seeds
 and weak beginnings lie intreasured
 such things become the hatch and brood of time
 and by the necessary form of this
 king richard might create a perfect guess
 that great northumberland then false to him
 would of that seed grow to a greater falseness
 which should not find a ground to root upon
 unless on you
king henry iv are these things then necessities
 then let us meet them like necessities
 and that same word even now cries out on us
 they say the bishop and northumberland
 are fifty thousand strong
warwick it cannot be my lord
 rumour doth double like the voice and echo
 the numbers of the fear'd please it your grace
 to go to bed upon my soul my lord
 the powers that you already have sent forth
 shall bring this prize in very easily
 to comfort you the more i have received
 a certain instance that glendower is dead
 your majesty hath been this fortnight ill
 and these unseason'd hours perforce must add
 unto your sickness
king henry iv i will take your counsel
 and were these inward wars once out of hand
 we would dear lords unto the holy land
 exeunt
 2 king henry iv
