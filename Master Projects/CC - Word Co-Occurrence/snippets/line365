 noble lords you have restrained yourself within the
 list of too cold an adieu be more expressive to
 them for they wear themselves in the cap of the
 time there do muster true gait eat speak and
 move under the influence of the most received star
 and though the devil lead the measure such are to
 be followed after them and take a more dilated farewell

 enter lafeu
lafeu kneeling pardon my lord for me and for my tidings
king i'll fee thee to stand up
lafeu then here's a man stands that has brought his pardon
 i would you had kneel'd my lord to ask me mercy
 and that at my bidding you could so stand up
king i would i had so i had broke thy pate
 and ask'd thee mercy for't
lafeu good faith across but my good lord tis thus
 will you be cured of your infirmity
king no
lafeu o will you eat no grapes my royal fox
 yes but you will my noble grapes an if
 my royal fox could reach them i have seen a medicine
 that's able to breathe life into a stone
 quicken a rock and make you dance canary
 with spritely fire and motion whose simple touch
 is powerful to araise king pepin nay
 to give great charlemain a pen in's hand
 and write to her a loveline
king what her is this
lafeu why doctor she my lord there's one arrived
 if you will see her now by my faith and honour
 if seriously i may convey my thoughts
 in this my light deliverance i have spoke
 with one that in her sex her years profession
 wisdom and constancy hath amazed me more
 than i dare blame my weakness will you see her
 for that is her demand and know her business
 that done laugh well at me
king now good lafeu
 bring in the admiration that we with thee
 may spend our wonder too or take off thine
 by wondering how thou took'st it
lafeu nay i'll fit you
 and not be all day neither
 exit
king thus he his special nothing ever prologues
 reenter lafeu with helena
lafeu nay come your ways
king this haste hath wings indeed
lafeu nay come your ways
 this is his majesty say your mind to him
 a traitor you do look like but such traitors
 his majesty seldom fears i am cressid's uncle
 that dare leave two together fare you well
 exit
king now fair one does your business follow us
helena ay my good lord
 gerard de narbon was my father
 in what he did profess well found
king i knew him
helena the rather will i spare my praises towards him
 knowing him is enough on's bed of death
 many receipts he gave me chiefly one
 which as the dearest issue of his practise
 and of his old experience the oily darling
 he bade me store up as a triple eye
 safer than mine own two more dear i have so
 and hearing your high majesty is touch'd
 with that malignant cause wherein the honour
 of my dear father's gift stands chief in power
 i come to tender it and my appliance
 with all bound humbleness
king we thank you maiden
 but may not be so credulous of cure
 when our most learned doctors leave us and
 the congregated college have concluded
 that labouring art can never ransom nature
 from her inaidible estate i say we must not
 so stain our judgment or corrupt our hope
 to prostitute our pastcure malady
 to empirics or to dissever so
 our great self and our credit to esteem
 a senseless help when help past sense we deem
helena my duty then shall pay me for my pains
 i will no more enforce mine office on you
 humbly entreating from your royal thoughts
 a modest one to bear me back a again
king i cannot give thee less to be call'd grateful
 thou thought'st to help me and such thanks i give
 as one near death to those that wish him live
 but what at full i know thou know'st no part
 i knowing all my peril thou no art
helena what i can do can do no hurt to try
 since you set up your rest gainst remedy
 he that of greatest works is finisher
 oft does them by the weakest minister
 so holy writ in babes hath judgment shown
 when judges have been babes great floods have flown
 from simple sources and great seas have dried
 when miracles have by the greatest been denied
 oft expectation fails and most oft there
 where most it promises and oft it hits
 where hope is coldest and despair most fits
king i must not hear thee fare thee well kind maid
 thy pains not used must by thyself be paid
 proffers not took reap thanks for their reward
helena inspired merit so by breath is barr'd
 it is not so with him that all things knows
 as tis with us that square our guess by shows
 but most it is presumption in us when
 the help of heaven we count the act of men
 dear sir to my endeavours give consent
 of heaven not me make an experiment
 i am not an impostor that proclaim
 myself against the level of mine aim
 but know i think and think i know most sure
 my art is not past power nor you past cure
king are thou so confident within what space
 hopest thou my cure
helena the great'st grace lending grace
 ere twice the horses of the sun shall bring
 their fiery torcher his diurnal ring
 ere twice in murk and occidental damp
 moist hesperus hath quench'd his sleepy lamp
 or four and twenty times the pilot's glass
 hath told the thievish minutes how they pass
 what is infirm from your sound parts shall fly
 health shall live free and sickness freely die
king upon thy certainty and confidence
 what darest thou venture
helena tax of impudence
 a strumpet's boldness a divulged shame
 traduced by odious ballads my maiden's name
 sear'd otherwise nay worseif worseextended
 with vilest torture let my life be ended
king methinks in thee some blessed spirit doth speak
 his powerful sound within an organ weak
 and what impossibility would slay
 in common sense sense saves another way
 thy life is dear for all that life can rate
 worth name of life in thee hath estimate
 youth beauty wisdom courage all
 that happiness and prime can happy call
 thou this to hazard needs must intimate
 skill infinite or monstrous desperate
 sweet practiser thy physic i will try
 that ministers thine own death if i die
helena if i break time or flinch in property
 of what i spoke unpitied let me die
 and well deserved not helping death's my fee
 but if i help what do you promise me
king make thy demand
helena but will you make it even
king ay by my sceptre and my hopes of heaven
helena then shalt thou give me with thy kingly hand
 what husband in thy power i will command
 exempted be from me the arrogance
 to choose from forth the royal blood of france
 my low and humble name to propagate
 with any branch or image of thy state
 but such a one thy vassal whom i know
 is free for me to ask thee to bestow
king here is my hand the premises observed
 thy will by my performance shall be served
 so make the choice of thy own time for i
 thy resolved patient on thee still rely
