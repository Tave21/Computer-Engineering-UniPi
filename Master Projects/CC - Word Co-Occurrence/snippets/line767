 of you my noble cousin buckingham
 if ever any grudge were lodged between us
 of you lord rivers and lord grey of you
 that without desert have frown'd on me
 dukes earls lords gentlemen indeed of all
 i do not know that englishman alive
 with whom my soul is any jot at odds
 more than the infant that is born tonight
 i thank my god for my humility
queen elizabeth a holy day shall this be kept hereafter
 i would to god all strifes were well compounded
 my sovereign liege i do beseech your majesty
 to take our brother clarence to your grace
gloucester why madam have i offer'd love for this
 to be so bouted in this royal presence
 who knows not that the noble duke is dead
 they all start
 you do him injury to scorn his corse
rivers who knows not he is dead who knows he is
queen elizabeth all seeing heaven what a world is this
buckingham look i so pale lord dorset as the rest
dorset ay my good lord and no one in this presence
 but his red colour hath forsook his cheeks
king edward iv is clarence dead the order was reversed
gloucester but he poor soul by your first order died
 and that a winged mercury did bear
 some tardy cripple bore the countermand
 that came too lag to see him buried
 god grant that some less noble and less loyal
 nearer in bloody thoughts but not in blood
 deserve not worse than wretched clarence did
 and yet go current from suspicion
 enter derby
dorset a boon my sovereign for my service done
king edward iv i pray thee peace my soul is full of sorrow
dorset i will not rise unless your highness grant
king edward iv then speak at once what is it thou demand'st
dorset the forfeit sovereign of my servant's life
 who slew today a righteous gentleman
 lately attendant on the duke of norfolk
king edward iv have a tongue to doom my brother's death
 and shall the same give pardon to a slave
 my brother slew no man his fault was thought
 and yet his punishment was cruel death
 who sued to me for him who in my rage
 kneel'd at my feet and bade me be advised
 who spake of brotherhood who spake of love
 who told me how the poor soul did forsake
 the mighty warwick and did fight for me
 who told me in the field by tewksbury
 when oxford had me down he rescued me
 and said dear brother live and be a king'
 who told me when we both lay in the field
 frozen almost to death how he did lap me
 even in his own garments and gave himself
 all thin and naked to the numb cold night
 all this from my remembrance brutish wrath
 sinfully pluck'd and not a man of you
 had so much grace to put it in my mind
 but when your carters or your waitingvassals
 have done a drunken slaughter and defaced
 the precious image of our dear redeemer
 you straight are on your knees for pardon pardon
 and i unjustly too must grant it you
 but for my brother not a man would speak
 nor i ungracious speak unto myself
 for him poor soul the proudest of you all
 have been beholding to him in his life
 yet none of you would once plead for his life
 o god i fear thy justice will take hold
 on me and you and mine and yours for this
 come hastings help me to my closet
 oh poor clarence
 exeunt some with king edward iv and queen margaret
gloucester this is the fruit of rashness mark'd you not
 how that the guilty kindred of the queen
 look'd pale when they did hear of clarence death
 o they did urge it still unto the king
 god will revenge it but come let us in
 to comfort edward with our company
buckingham we wait upon your grace
 exeunt
 king richard iii
act ii
scene ii the palace
 enter the duchess of york with the two children of clarence
boy tell me good grandam is our father dead
duchess of york no boy
boy why do you wring your hands and beat your breast
 and cry o clarence my unhappy son'
girl why do you look on us and shake your head
 and call us wretches orphans castaways
 if that our noble father be alive
duchess of york my pretty cousins you mistake me much
 i do lament the sickness of the king
 as loath to lose him not your father's death
 it were lost sorrow to wail one that's lost
boy then grandam you conclude that he is dead
 the king my uncle is to blame for this
 god will revenge it whom i will importune
 with daily prayers all to that effect
girl and so will i
duchess of york peace children peace the king doth love you well
 incapable and shallow innocents
 you cannot guess who caused your father's death
boy grandam we can for my good uncle gloucester
 told me the king provoked by the queen
 devised impeachments to imprison him 
 and when my uncle told me so he wept
 and hugg'd me in his arm and kindly kiss'd my cheek
 bade me rely on him as on my father
 and he would love me dearly as his child
duchess of york oh that deceit should steal such gentle shapes
 and with a virtuous vizard hide foul guile
 he is my son yea and therein my shame
 yet from my dugs he drew not this deceit
boy think you my uncle did dissemble grandam
duchess of york ay boy
boy i cannot think it hark what noise is this
 enter queen elizabeth with her hair about her
 ears rivers and dorset after her
queen elizabeth oh who shall hinder me to wail and weep
 to chide my fortune and torment myself
 i'll join with black despair against my soul
 and to myself become an enemy
duchess of york what means this scene of rude impatience
queen elizabeth to make an act of tragic violence
 edward my lord your son our king is dead
 why grow the branches now the root is wither'd
 why wither not the leaves the sap being gone
 if you will live lament if die be brief
 that our swiftwinged souls may catch the king's
 or like obedient subjects follow him
 to his new kingdom of perpetual rest
duchess of york ah so much interest have i in thy sorrow
 as i had title in thy noble husband
 i have bewept a worthy husband's death
 and lived by looking on his images
 but now two mirrors of his princely semblance
 are crack'd in pieces by malignant death
 and i for comfort have but one false glass
 which grieves me when i see my shame in him
 thou art a widow yet thou art a mother
 and hast the comfort of thy children left thee
 but death hath snatch'd my husband from mine arms
 and pluck'd two crutches from my feeble limbs
 edward and clarence o what cause have i
 thine being but a moiety of my grief
 to overgo thy plaints and drown thy cries
boy good aunt you wept not for our father's death
 how can we aid you with our kindred tears
girl our fatherless distress was left unmoan'd
 your widowdolour likewise be unwept
queen elizabeth give me no help in lamentation
 i am not barren to bring forth complaints
 all springs reduce their currents to mine eyes
 that i being govern'd by the watery moon
 may send forth plenteous tears to drown the world
 oh for my husband for my dear lord edward
children oh for our father for our dear lord clarence
duchess of york alas for both both mine edward and clarence
queen elizabeth what stay had i but edward and he's gone
children what stay had we but clarence and he's gone
duchess of york what stays had i but they and they are gone
queen elizabeth was never widow had so dear a loss
children were never orphans had so dear a loss
duchess of york was never mother had so dear a loss
 alas i am the mother of these moans
 their woes are parcell'd mine are general
 she for an edward weeps and so do i
 i for a clarence weep so doth not she
 these babes for clarence weep and so do i
 i for an edward weep so do not they
 alas you three on me threefold distress'd
 pour all your tears i am your sorrow's nurse
 and i will pamper it with lamentations
dorset comfort dear mother god is much displeased
 that you take with unthankfulness his doing
 in common worldly things tis call'd ungrateful
 with dull unwilligness to repay a debt
 which with a bounteous hand was kindly lent
 much more to be thus opposite with heaven
 for it requires the royal debt it lent you
rivers madam bethink you like a careful mother
 of the young prince your son send straight for him
 let him be crown'd in him your comfort lives
 drown desperate sorrow in dead edward's grave
 and plant your joys in living edward's throne
 enter gloucester buckingham derby hastings and ratcliff
gloucester madam have comfort all of us have cause
 to wail the dimming of our shining star
 but none can cure their harms by wailing them
 madam my mother i do cry you mercy
 i did not see your grace humbly on my knee
 i crave your blessing
duchess of york god bless thee and put meekness in thy mind
 love charity obedience and true duty
gloucester aside amen and make me die a good old man
 that is the buttend of a mother's blessing
 i marvel why her grace did leave it out
