king henry v god quit you in his mercy hear your sentence
 you have conspired against our royal person
 join'd with an enemy proclaim'd and from his coffers
 received the golden earnest of our death
 wherein you would have sold your king to slaughter
 his princes and his peers to servitude
 his subjects to oppression and contempt
 and his whole kingdom into desolation
 touching our person seek we no revenge
 but we our kingdom's safety must so tender
 whose ruin you have sought that to her laws
 we do deliver you get you therefore hence
 poor miserable wretches to your death
 the taste whereof god of his mercy give
 you patience to endure and true repentance
 of all your dear offences bear them hence
 exeunt cambridge scroop and grey guarded
 now lords for france the enterprise whereof
 shall be to you as us like glorious
 we doubt not of a fair and lucky war
 since god so graciously hath brought to light
 this dangerous treason lurking in our way
 to hinder our beginnings we doubt not now
 but every rub is smoothed on our way
 then forth dear countrymen let us deliver
 our puissance into the hand of god
 putting it straight in expedition
 cheerly to sea the signs of war advance
 no king of england if not king of france

act ii
scene iv france the king's palace
 flourish enter the french king the dauphin the
 dukes of berri and bretagne the constable and others
king of france thus comes the english with full power upon us
 and more than carefully it us concerns
 to answer royally in our defences
 therefore the dukes of berri and of bretagne
 of brabant and of orleans shall make forth
 and you prince dauphin with all swift dispatch
 to line and new repair our towns of war
 with men of courage and with means defendant
 for england his approaches makes as fierce
 as waters to the sucking of a gulf
 it fits us then to be as provident
 as fear may teach us out of late examples
 left by the fatal and neglected english
 upon our fields
dauphin my most redoubted father
 it is most meet we arm us gainst the foe
 for peace itself should not so dull a kingdom
 though war nor no known quarrel were in question
 but that defences musters preparations
 should be maintain'd assembled and collected
 as were a war in expectation
 therefore i say tis meet we all go forth
 to view the sick and feeble parts of france
 and let us do it with no show of fear
 no with no more than if we heard that england
 were busied with a whitsun morrisdance
 for my good liege she is so idly king'd
 her sceptre so fantastically borne
 by a vain giddy shallow humorous youth
 that fear attends her not
constable o peace prince dauphin
 you are too much mistaken in this king
 question your grace the late ambassadors
 with what great state he heard their embassy
 how well supplied with noble counsellors
 how modest in exception and withal
 how terrible in constant resolution
 and you shall find his vanities forespent
 were but the outside of the roman brutus
 covering discretion with a coat of folly
 as gardeners do with ordure hide those roots
 that shall first spring and be most delicate
dauphin well tis not so my lord high constable
 but though we think it so it is no matter
 in cases of defence tis best to weigh
 the enemy more mighty than he seems
 so the proportions of defence are fill'd
 which of a weak or niggardly projection
 doth like a miser spoil his coat with scanting
 a little cloth
king of france think we king harry strong
 and princes look you strongly arm to meet him
 the kindred of him hath been flesh'd upon us
 and he is bred out of that bloody strain
 that haunted us in our familiar paths
 witness our too much memorable shame
 when cressy battle fatally was struck
 and all our princes captiv'd by the hand
 of that black name edward black prince of wales
 whiles that his mountain sire on mountain standing
 up in the air crown'd with the golden sun
 saw his heroical seed and smiled to see him
 mangle the work of nature and deface
 the patterns that by god and by french fathers
 had twenty years been made this is a stem
 of that victorious stock and let us fear
 the native mightiness and fate of him
 enter a messenger
messenger ambassadors from harry king of england
 do crave admittance to your majesty
king of france we'll give them present audience go and bring them
 exeunt messenger and certain lords
 you see this chase is hotly follow'd friends
dauphin turn head and stop pursuit for coward dogs
 most spend their mouths when what they seem to threaten
 runs far before them good my sovereign
 take up the english short and let them know
 of what a monarchy you are the head
 selflove my liege is not so vile a sin
 as selfneglecting
 reenter lords with exeter and train
king of france from our brother england
exeter from him and thus he greets your majesty
 he wills you in the name of god almighty
 that you divest yourself and lay apart
 the borrow'd glories that by gift of heaven
 by law of nature and of nations long
 to him and to his heirs namely the crown
 and all widestretched honours that pertain
 by custom and the ordinance of times
 unto the crown of france that you may know
 tis no sinister nor no awkward claim
 pick'd from the wormholes of longvanish'd days
 nor from the dust of old oblivion raked
 he sends you this most memorable line
 in every branch truly demonstrative
 willing to overlook this pedigree
 and when you find him evenly derived
 from his most famed of famous ancestors
