 to spend upon his haters if thou please
 to take me to thee as i was to him
 i'll be to caesar if thou pleasest not
 i yield thee up my life
octavius caesar what is't thou say'st
dercetas i say o caesar antony is dead
octavius caesar the breaking of so great a thing should make
 a greater crack the round world
 should have shook lions into civil streets
 and citizens to their dens the death of antony
 is not a single doom in the name lay
 a moiety of the world
dercetas he is dead caesar
 not by a public minister of justice
 nor by a hired knife but that self hand
 which writ his honour in the acts it did
 hath with the courage which the heart did lend it
 splitted the heart this is his sword
 i robb'd his wound of it behold it stain'd
 with his most noble blood
octavius caesar look you sad friends
 the gods rebuke me but it is tidings
 to wash the eyes of kings
agrippa and strange it is
 that nature must compel us to lament
 our most persisted deeds
mecaenas his taints and honours
 waged equal with him
agrippa a rarer spirit never
 did steer humanity but you gods will give us
 some faults to make us men caesar is touch'd
mecaenas when such a spacious mirror's set before him
 he needs must see himself
octavius caesar o antony
 i have follow'd thee to this but we do lance
 diseases in our bodies i must perforce
 have shown to thee such a declining day
 or look on thine we could not stall together
 in the whole world but yet let me lament
 with tears as sovereign as the blood of hearts
 that thou my brother my competitor
 in top of all design my mate in empire
 friend and companion in the front of war
 the arm of mine own body and the heart
 where mine his thoughts did kindlethat our stars
 unreconciliable should divide
 our equalness to this hear me good friends
 but i will tell you at some meeter season
 enter an egyptian
 the business of this man looks out of him
 we'll hear him what he says whence are you
egyptian a poor egyptian yet the queen my mistress
 confined in all she has her monument
 of thy intents desires instruction
 that she preparedly may frame herself
 to the way she's forced to
octavius caesar bid her have good heart
 she soon shall know of us by some of ours
 how honourable and how kindly we
 determine for her for caesar cannot live
 to be ungentle
egyptian so the gods preserve thee
 exit
octavius caesar come hither proculeius go and say
 we purpose her no shame give her what comforts
 the quality of her passion shall require
 lest in her greatness by some mortal stroke
 she do defeat us for her life in rome
 would be eternal in our triumph go
 and with your speediest bring us what she says
 and how you find of her
proculeius caesar i shall
 exit
octavius caesar gallus go you along
 exit gallus
 where's dolabella
 to second proculeius
all dolabella
octavius caesar let him alone for i remember now
 how he's employ'd he shall in time be ready
 go with me to my tent where you shall see
 how hardly i was drawn into this war
 how calm and gentle i proceeded still
 in all my writings go with me and see
 what i can show in this
 exeunt
 antony and cleopatra
act v
scene ii alexandria a room in the monument
 enter cleopatra charmian and iras
cleopatra my desolation does begin to make
 a better life tis paltry to be caesar
 not being fortune he's but fortune's knave
 a minister of her will and it is great
 to do that thing that ends all other deeds
 which shackles accidents and bolts up change
 which sleeps and never palates more the dug
 the beggar's nurse and caesar's
 enter to the gates of the monument proculeius
 gallus and soldiers
proculeius caesar sends greeting to the queen of egypt
 and bids thee study on what fair demands
 thou mean'st to have him grant thee
cleopatra what's thy name
proculeius my name is proculeius
cleopatra antony
 did tell me of you bade me trust you but
 i do not greatly care to be deceived
 that have no use for trusting if your master
 would have a queen his beggar you must tell him
 that majesty to keep decorum must
 no less beg than a kingdom if he please
 to give me conquer'd egypt for my son
 he gives me so much of mine own as i
 will kneel to him with thanks
proculeius be of good cheer
 you're fall'n into a princely hand fear nothing
 make your full reference freely to my lord
 who is so full of grace that it flows over
 on all that need let me report to him
 your sweet dependency and you shall find
 a conqueror that will pray in aid for kindness
 where he for grace is kneel'd to
cleopatra pray you tell him
 i am his fortune's vassal and i send him
 the greatness he has got i hourly learn
 a doctrine of obedience and would gladly
 look him i the face
proculeius this i'll report dear lady
 have comfort for i know your plight is pitied
 of him that caused it
gallus you see how easily she may be surprised
 here proculeius and two of the guard ascend the
 monument by a ladder placed against a window and
 having descended come behind cleopatra some of
 the guard unbar and open the gates
 to proculeius and the guard
 guard her till caesar come
 exit
iras royal queen
charmian o cleopatra thou art taken queen
cleopatra quick quick good hands
 drawing a dagger
proculeius hold worthy lady hold
 seizes and disarms her
 do not yourself such wrong who are in this
 relieved but not betray'd
cleopatra what of death too
 that rids our dogs of languish
proculeius cleopatra
 do not abuse my master's bounty by
 the undoing of yourself let the world see
 his nobleness well acted which your death
 will never let come forth
cleopatra where art thou death
 come hither come come come and take a queen
 worthy many babes and beggars
proculeius o temperance lady
cleopatra sir i will eat no meat i'll not drink sir
 if idle talk will once be necessary
 i'll not sleep neither this mortal house i'll ruin
 do caesar what he can know sir that i
 will not wait pinion'd at your master's court
 nor once be chastised with the sober eye
 of dull octavia shall they hoist me up
 and show me to the shouting varletry
 of censuring rome rather a ditch in egypt
 be gentle grave unto me rather on nilus mud
 lay me stark naked and let the waterflies
 blow me into abhorring rather make
 my country's high pyramides my gibbet
 and hang me up in chains
proculeius you do extend
 these thoughts of horror further than you shall
 find cause in caesar
 enter dolabella
dolabella proculeius
 what thou hast done thy master caesar knows
 and he hath sent for thee for the queen
 i'll take her to my guard
proculeius so dolabella
 it shall content me best be gentle to her
 to cleopatra
 to caesar i will speak what you shall please
 if you'll employ me to him
cleopatra say i would die
 exeunt proculeius and soldiers
dolabella most noble empress you have heard of me
cleopatra i cannot tell
dolabella assuredly you know me
cleopatra no matter sir what i have heard or known
 you laugh when boys or women tell their dreams
 is't not your trick
dolabella i understand not madam
cleopatra i dream'd there was an emperor antony
 o such another sleep that i might see
 but such another man
dolabella if it might please ye
cleopatra his face was as the heavens and therein stuck
 a sun and moon which kept their course
