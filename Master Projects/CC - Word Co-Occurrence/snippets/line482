 kindled with unchaste desire
 fed in heart whose flames aspire
 as thoughts do blow them higher and higher
 pinch him fairies mutually
 pinch him for his villany
 pinch him and burn him and turn him about
 till candles and starlight and moonshine be out
 during this song they pinch falstaff doctor caius
 comes one way and steals away a boy in green
 slender another way and takes off a boy in white
 and fenton comes and steals away ann page
 a noise of hunting is heard within all the
 fairies run away falstaff pulls off his buck's
 head and rises

ford ay and an ox too both the proofs are extant
falstaff and these are not fairies i was three or four
 times in the thought they were not fairies and yet
 the guiltiness of my mind the sudden surprise of my
 powers drove the grossness of the foppery into a
 received belief in despite of the teeth of all
 rhyme and reason that they were fairies see now
 how wit may be made a jackalent when tis upon
 ill employment

 desires and fairies will not pinse you

 this am i ridden with a welsh goat too shall i
 have a coxcomb of frize tis time i were choked
 with a piece of toasted cheese
sir hugh evans seese is not good to give putter your belly is all putter
falstaff seese and putter have i lived to stand at the
 taunt of one that makes fritters of english this
 is enough to be the decay of lust and latewalking
 through the realm
mistress page why sir john do you think though we would have the
 virtue out of our hearts by the head and shoulders
 and have given ourselves without scruple to hell
 that ever the devil could have made you our delight
ford what a hodgepudding a bag of flax
mistress page a puffed man
page old cold withered and of intolerable entrails
ford and one that is as slanderous as satan
page and as poor as job
ford and as wicked as his wife
sir hugh evans and given to fornications and to taverns and sack
 and wine and metheglins and to drinkings and
 swearings and starings pribbles and prabbles

 am dejected i am not able to answer the welsh
 flannel ignorance itself is a plummet o'er me use

page now mistress how chance you went not with master slender
mistress page why went you not with master doctor maid
fenton you do amaze her hear the truth of it
 you would have married her most shamefully
 where there was no proportion held in love
 the truth is she and i long since contracted
 are now so sure that nothing can dissolve us
 the offence is holy that she hath committed
 and this deceit loses the name of craft
 of disobedience or unduteous title
 since therein she doth evitate and shun
 a thousand irreligious cursed hours
 which forced marriage would have brought upon her
ford stand not amazed here is no remedy
 in love the heavens themselves do guide the state
 money buys lands and wives are sold by fate
falstaff i am glad though you have ta'en a special stand to
 strike at me that your arrow hath glanced
page well what remedy fenton heaven give thee joy
 what cannot be eschew'd must be embraced
falstaff when nightdogs run all sorts of deer are chased
mistress page well i will muse no further master fenton
 heaven give you many many merry days
 good husband let us every one go home
 and laugh this sport o'er by a country fire
