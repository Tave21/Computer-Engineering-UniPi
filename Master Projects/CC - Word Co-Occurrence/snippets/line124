and he that betrayed him had given them a token saying whomsoever i shall kiss that same is he take him and lead him away safely
and as soon as he was come he goeth straightway to him and saith master master and kissed him
and they laid their hands on him and took him
and one of them that stood by drew a sword and smote a servant of the high priest and cut off his ear
and jesus answered and said unto them are ye come out as against a thief with swords and with staves to take me
i was daily with you in the temple teaching and ye took me not but the scriptures must be fulfilled
and they all forsook him and fled
and there followed him a certain young man having a linen cloth cast about his naked body and the young men laid hold on him
and he left the linen cloth and fled from them naked
and they led jesus away to the high priest and with him were assembled all the chief priests and the elders and the scribes
and peter followed him afar off even into the palace of the high priest and he sat with the servants and warmed himself at the fire
and the chief priests and all the council sought for witness against jesus to put him to death and found none
for many bare false witness against him but their witness agreed not together
and there arose certain and bare false witness against him saying
we heard him say i will destroy this temple that is made with hands and within three days i will build another made without hands
but neither so did their witness agree together
and the high priest stood up in the midst and asked jesus saying answerest thou nothing what is it which these witness against thee
but he held his peace and answered nothing again the high priest asked him and said unto him art thou the christ the son of the blessed
and jesus said i am and ye shall see the son of man sitting on the right hand of power and coming in the clouds of heaven
then the high priest rent his clothes and saith what need we any further witnesses
ye have heard the blasphemy what think ye and they all condemned him to be guilty of death
and some began to spit on him and to cover his face and to buffet him and to say unto him prophesy and the servants did strike him with the palms of their hands
and as peter was beneath in the palace there cometh one of the maids of the high priest
and when she saw peter warming himself she looked upon him and said and thou also wast with jesus of nazareth
but he denied saying i know not neither understand i what thou sayest and he went out into the porch and the cock crew
and a maid saw him again and began to say to them that stood by this is one of them
and he denied it again and a little after they that stood by said again to peter surely thou art one of them for thou art a galilaean and thy speech agreeth thereto
but he began to curse and to swear saying i know not this man of whom ye speak
and the second time the cock crew and peter called to mind the word that jesus said unto him before the cock crow twice thou shalt deny me thrice and when he thought thereon he wept
and straightway in the morning the chief priests held a consultation with the elders and scribes and the whole council and bound jesus and carried him away and delivered him to pilate
and pilate asked him art thou the king of the jews and he answering said unto him thou sayest it
and the chief priests accused him of many things but he answered nothing
and pilate asked him again saying answerest thou nothing behold how many things they witness against thee
but jesus yet answered nothing so that pilate marvelled
now at that feast he released unto them one prisoner whomsoever they desired
and there was one named barabbas which lay bound with them that had made insurrection with him who had committed murder in the insurrection
and the multitude crying aloud began to desire him to do as he had ever done unto them
but pilate answered them saying will ye that i release unto you the king of the jews
for he knew that the chief priests had delivered him for envy
but the chief priests moved the people that he should rather release barabbas unto them
and pilate answered and said again unto them what will ye then that i shall do unto him whom ye call the king of the jews
and they cried out again crucify him
then pilate said unto them why what evil hath he done and they cried out the more exceedingly crucify him
and so pilate willing to content the people released barabbas unto them and delivered jesus when he had scourged him to be crucified
and the soldiers led him away into the hall called praetorium and they call together the whole band
and they clothed him with purple and platted a crown of thorns and put it about his head
and began to salute him hail king of the jews
and they smote him on the head with a reed and did spit upon him and bowing their knees worshipped him
and when they had mocked him they took off the purple from him and put his own clothes on him and led him out to crucify him
and they compel one simon a cyrenian who passed by coming out of the country the father of alexander and rufus to bear his cross
and they bring him unto the place golgotha which is being interpreted the place of a skull
and they gave him to drink wine mingled with myrrh but he received it not
and when they had crucified him they parted his garments casting lots upon them what every man should take
and it was the third hour and they crucified him
and the superscription of his accusation was written over the king of the jews
and with him they crucify two thieves the one on his right hand and the other on his left
and the scripture was fulfilled which saith and he was numbered with the transgressors
and they that passed by railed on him wagging their heads and saying ah thou that destroyest the temple and buildest it in three days
save thyself and come down from the cross
likewise also the chief priests mocking said among themselves with the scribes he saved others himself he cannot save
let christ the king of israel descend now from the cross that we may see and believe and they that were crucified with him reviled him
and when the sixth hour was come there was darkness over the whole land until the ninth hour
and at the ninth hour jesus cried with a loud voice saying eloi eloi lama sabachthani which is being interpreted my god my god why hast thou forsaken me
and some of them that stood by when they heard it said behold he calleth elias
and one ran and filled a spunge full of vinegar and put it on a reed and gave him to drink saying let alone let us see whether elias will come to take him down
and jesus cried with a loud voice and gave up the ghost
and the veil of the temple was rent in twain from the top to the bottom
and when the centurion which stood over against him saw that he so cried out and gave up the ghost he said truly this man was the son of god
there were also women looking on afar off among whom was mary magdalene and mary the mother of james the less and of joses and salome
who also when he was in galilee followed him and ministered unto him and many other women which came up with him unto jerusalem
and now when the even was come because it was the preparation that is the day before the sabbath
joseph of arimathaea an honourable counsellor which also waited for the kingdom of god came and went in boldly unto pilate and craved the body of jesus
and pilate marvelled if he were already dead and calling unto him the centurion he asked him whether he had been any while dead
and when he knew it of the centurion he gave the body to joseph
and he bought fine linen and took him down and wrapped him in the linen and laid him in a sepulchre which was hewn out of a rock and rolled a stone unto the door of the sepulchre
and mary magdalene and mary the mother of joses beheld where he was laid
and when the sabbath was past mary magdalene and mary the mother of james and salome had bought sweet spices that they might come and anoint him
and very early in the morning the first day of the week they came unto the sepulchre at the rising of the sun
and they said among themselves who shall roll us away the stone from the door of the sepulchre
and when they looked they saw that the stone was rolled away for it was very great
and entering into the sepulchre they saw a young man sitting on the right side clothed in a long white garment and they were affrighted
and he saith unto them be not affrighted ye seek jesus of nazareth which was crucified he is risen he is not here behold the place where they laid him
but go your way tell his disciples and peter that he goeth before you into galilee there shall ye see him as he said unto you
and they went out quickly and fled from the sepulchre for they trembled and were amazed neither said they any thing to any man for they were afraid
now when jesus was risen early the first day of the week he appeared first to mary magdalene out of whom he had cast seven devils
and she went and told them that had been with him as they mourned and wept
and they when they had heard that he was alive and had been seen of her believed not
after that he appeared in another form unto two of them as they walked and went into the country
and they went and told it unto the residue neither believed they them
afterward he appeared unto the eleven as they sat at meat and upbraided them with their unbelief and hardness of heart because they believed not them which had seen him after he was risen
and he said unto them go ye into all the world and preach the gospel to every creature
he that believeth and is baptized shall be saved but he that believeth not shall be damned
and these signs shall follow them that believe in my name shall they cast out devils they shall speak with new tongues
they shall take up serpents and if they drink any deadly thing it shall not hurt them they shall lay hands on the sick and they shall recover
so then after the lord had spoken unto them he was received up into heaven and sat on the right hand of god
and they went forth and preached every where the lord working with them and confirming the word with signs following amen
forasmuch as many have taken in hand to set forth in order a declaration of those things which are most surely believed among us
even as they delivered them unto us which from the beginning were eyewitnesses and ministers of the word
it seemed good to me also having had perfect understanding of all things from the very first to write unto thee in order most excellent theophilus
that thou mightest know the certainty of those things wherein thou hast been instructed
there was in the days of herod the king of judaea a certain priest named zacharias of the course of abia and his wife was of the daughters of aaron and her name was elisabeth
and they were both righteous before god walking in all the commandments and ordinances of the lord blameless
and they had no child because that elisabeth was barren and they both were now well stricken in years
and it came to pass that while he executed the priest's office before god in the order of his course
according to the custom of the priest's office his lot was to burn incense when he went into the temple of the lord
and the whole multitude of the people were praying without at the time of incense
and there appeared unto him an angel of the lord standing on the right side of the altar of incense
and when zacharias saw him he was troubled and fear fell upon him
but the angel said unto him fear not zacharias for thy prayer is heard and thy wife elisabeth shall bear thee a son and thou shalt call his name john
and thou shalt have joy and gladness and many shall rejoice at his birth
for he shall be great in the sight of the lord and shall drink neither wine nor strong drink and he shall be filled with the holy ghost even from his mother's womb
and many of the children of israel shall he turn to the lord their god
and he shall go before him in the spirit and power of elias to turn the hearts of the fathers to the children and the disobedient to the wisdom of the just to make ready a people prepared for the lord
and zacharias said unto the angel whereby shall i know this for i am an old man and my wife well stricken in years
and the angel answering said unto him i am gabriel that stand in the presence of god and am sent to speak unto thee and to shew thee these glad tidings
and behold thou shalt be dumb and not able to speak until the day that these things shall be performed because thou believest not my words which shall be fulfilled in their season
and the people waited for zacharias and marvelled that he tarried so long in the temple
and when he came out he could not speak unto them and they perceived that he had seen a vision in the temple for he beckoned unto them and remained speechless
and it came to pass that as soon as the days of his ministration were accomplished he departed to his own house
and after those days his wife elisabeth conceived and hid herself five months saying
thus hath the lord dealt with me in the days wherein he looked on me to take away my reproach among men
and in the sixth month the angel gabriel was sent from god unto a city of galilee named nazareth
to a virgin espoused to a man whose name was joseph of the house of david and the virgin's name was mary
and the angel came in unto her and said hail thou that art highly favoured the lord is with thee blessed art thou among women
and when she saw him she was troubled at his saying and cast in her mind what manner of salutation this should be
and the angel said unto her fear not mary for thou hast found favour with god
and behold thou shalt conceive in thy womb and bring forth a son and shalt call his name jesus
he shall be great and shall be called the son of the highest and the lord god shall give unto him the throne of his father david
and he shall reign over the house of jacob for ever and of his kingdom there shall be no end
then said mary unto the angel how shall this be seeing i know not a man
and the angel answered and said unto her the holy ghost shall come upon thee and the power of the highest shall overshadow thee therefore also that holy thing which shall be born of thee shall be called the son of god
and behold thy cousin elisabeth she hath also conceived a son in her old age and this is the sixth month with her who was called barren
for with god nothing shall be impossible
and mary said behold the handmaid of the lord be it unto me according to thy word and the angel departed from her
and mary arose in those days and went into the hill country with haste into a city of juda
and entered into the house of zacharias and saluted elisabeth
and it came to pass that when elisabeth heard the salutation of mary the babe leaped in her womb and elisabeth was filled with the holy ghost
and she spake out with a loud voice and said blessed art thou among women and blessed is the fruit of thy womb
and whence is this to me that the mother of my lord should come to me
for lo as soon as the voice of thy salutation sounded in mine ears the babe leaped in my womb for joy
and blessed is she that believed for there shall be a performance of those things which were told her from the lord
and mary said my soul doth magnify the lord
and my spirit hath rejoiced in god my saviour
for he hath regarded the low estate of his handmaiden for behold from henceforth all generations shall call me blessed
for he that is mighty hath done to me great things and holy is his name
and his mercy is on them that fear him from generation to generation
he hath shewed strength with his arm he hath scattered the proud in the imagination of their hearts
he hath put down the mighty from their seats and exalted them of low degree
he hath filled the hungry with good things and the rich he hath sent empty away
he hath holpen his servant israel in remembrance of his mercy
as he spake to our fathers to abraham and to his seed for ever
and mary abode with her about three months and returned to her own house
now elisabeth's full time came that she should be delivered and she brought forth a son
and her neighbours and her cousins heard how the lord had shewed great mercy upon her and they rejoiced with her
and it came to pass that on the eighth day they came to circumcise the child and they called him zacharias after the name of his father
and his mother answered and said not so but he shall be called john
and they said unto her there is none of thy kindred that is called by this name
and they made signs to his father how he would have him called
and he asked for a writing table and wrote saying his name is john and they marvelled all
and his mouth was opened immediately and his tongue loosed and he spake and praised god
and fear came on all that dwelt round about them and all these sayings were noised abroad throughout all the hill country of judaea
and all they that heard them laid them up in their hearts saying what manner of child shall this be and the hand of the lord was with him
and his father zacharias was filled with the holy ghost and prophesied saying
blessed be the lord god of israel for he hath visited and redeemed his people
and hath raised up an horn of salvation for us in the house of his servant david
as he spake by the mouth of his holy prophets which have been since the world began
that we should be saved from our enemies and from the hand of all that hate us
to perform the mercy promised to our fathers and to remember his holy covenant
the oath which he sware to our father abraham
that he would grant unto us that we being delivered out of the hand of our enemies might serve him without fear
in holiness and righteousness before him all the days of our life
and thou child shalt be called the prophet of the highest for thou shalt go before the face of the lord to prepare his ways
to give knowledge of salvation unto his people by the remission of their sins
through the tender mercy of our god whereby the dayspring from on high hath visited us
to give light to them that sit in darkness and in the shadow of death to guide our feet into the way of peace
and the child grew and waxed strong in spirit and was in the deserts till the day of his shewing unto israel
and it came to pass in those days that there went out a decree from caesar augustus that all the world should be taxed
and this taxing was first made when cyrenius was governor of syria
and all went to be taxed every one into his own city
and joseph also went up from galilee out of the city of nazareth into judaea unto the city of david which is called bethlehem because he was of the house and lineage of david
to be taxed with mary his espoused wife being great with child
and so it was that while they were there the days were accomplished that she should be delivered
and she brought forth her firstborn son and wrapped him in swaddling clothes and laid him in a manger because there was no room for them in the inn
and there were in the same country shepherds abiding in the field keeping watch over their flock by night
and lo the angel of the lord came upon them and the glory of the lord shone round about them and they were sore afraid
and the angel said unto them fear not for behold i bring you good tidings of great joy which shall be to all people
for unto you is born this day in the city of david a saviour which is christ the lord
and this shall be a sign unto you ye shall find the babe wrapped in swaddling clothes lying in a manger
and suddenly there was with the angel a multitude of the heavenly host praising god and saying
glory to god in the highest and on earth peace good will toward men
and it came to pass as the angels were gone away from them into heaven the shepherds said one to another let us now go even unto bethlehem and see this thing which is come to pass which the lord hath made known unto us
and they came with haste and found mary and joseph and the babe lying in a manger
and when they had seen it they made known abroad the saying which was told them concerning this child
and all they that heard it wondered at those things which were told them by the shepherds
but mary kept all these things and pondered them in her heart
and the shepherds returned glorifying and praising god for all the things that they had heard and seen as it was told unto them
and when eight days were accomplished for the circumcising of the child his name was called jesus which was so named of the angel before he was conceived in the womb
and when the days of her purification according to the law of moses were accomplished they brought him to jerusalem to present him to the lord
as it is written in the law of the lord every male that openeth the womb shall be called holy to the lord
and to offer a sacrifice according to that which is said in the law of the lord a pair of turtledoves or two young pigeons
