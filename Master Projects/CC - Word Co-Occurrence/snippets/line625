 1 king henry iv
act v
scene i king henry iv's camp near shrewsbury
 enter king henry prince henry lord john of
 lancaster earl of westmoreland sir walter blunt
 and falstaff
king henry iv how bloodily the sun begins to peer
 above yon busky hill the day looks pale
 at his distemperature
prince henry the southern wind
 doth play the trumpet to his purposes
 and by his hollow whistling in the leaves
 foretells a tempest and a blustering day
king henry iv then with the losers let it sympathize
 for nothing can seem foul to those that win
 the trumpet sounds
 enter worcester and vernon
 how now my lord of worcester tis not well
 that you and i should meet upon such terms
 as now we meet you have deceived our trust
 and made us doff our easy robes of peace
 to crush our old limbs in ungentle steel
 this is not well my lord this is not well
 what say you to it will you again unknit
 this curlish knot of allabhorred war
 and move in that obedient orb again
 where you did give a fair and natural light
 and be no more an exhaled meteor
 a prodigy of fear and a portent
 of broached mischief to the unborn times
earl of worcester hear me my liege
 for mine own part i could be well content
 to entertain the lagend of my life
 with quiet hours for i do protest
 i have not sought the day of this dislike
king henry iv you have not sought it how comes it then
falstaff rebellion lay in his way and he found it
prince henry peace chewet peace
earl of worcester it pleased your majesty to turn your looks
 of favour from myself and all our house
 and yet i must remember you my lord
 we were the first and dearest of your friends
 for you my staff of office did i break
 in richard's time and posted day and night
 to meet you on the way and kiss your hand
 when yet you were in place and in account
 nothing so strong and fortunate as i
 it was myself my brother and his son
 that brought you home and boldly did outdare
 the dangers of the time you swore to us
 and you did swear that oath at doncaster
 that you did nothing purpose gainst the state
 nor claim no further than your newfall'n right
 the seat of gaunt dukedom of lancaster
 to this we swore our aid but in short space
 it rain'd down fortune showering on your head
 and such a flood of greatness fell on you
 what with our help what with the absent king
 what with the injuries of a wanton time
 the seeming sufferances that you had borne
 and the contrarious winds that held the king
 so long in his unlucky irish wars
 that all in england did repute him dead
 and from this swarm of fair advantages
 you took occasion to be quickly woo'd
 to gripe the general sway into your hand
 forget your oath to us at doncaster
 and being fed by us you used us so
 as that ungentle hull the cuckoo's bird
 useth the sparrow did oppress our nest
 grew by our feeding to so great a bulk
 that even our love durst not come near your sight
 for fear of swallowing but with nimble wing
 we were enforced for safety sake to fly
 out of sight and raise this present head
 whereby we stand opposed by such means
 as you yourself have forged against yourself
 by unkind usage dangerous countenance
 and violation of all faith and troth
 sworn to us in your younger enterprise
king henry iv these things indeed you have articulate
 proclaim'd at marketcrosses read in churches
 to face the garment of rebellion
 with some fine colour that may please the eye
 of fickle changelings and poor discontents
 which gape and rub the elbow at the news
 of hurlyburly innovation
 and never yet did insurrection want
 such watercolours to impaint his cause
 nor moody beggars starving for a time
 of pellmell havoc and confusion
prince henry in both your armies there is many a soul
 shall pay full dearly for this encounter
 if once they join in trial tell your nephew
 the prince of wales doth join with all the world
 in praise of henry percy by my hopes
 this present enterprise set off his head
 i do not think a braver gentleman
 more activevaliant or more valiantyoung
 more daring or more bold is now alive
 to grace this latter age with noble deeds
 for my part i may speak it to my shame
 i have a truant been to chivalry
 and so i hear he doth account me too
 yet this before my father's majesty
 i am content that he shall take the odds
 of his great name and estimation
 and will to save the blood on either side
 try fortune with him in a single fight
king henry iv and prince of wales so dare we venture thee
 albeit considerations infinite
 do make against it no good worcester no
 we love our people well even those we love
 that are misled upon your cousin's part
 and will they take the offer of our grace
 both he and they and you every man
 shall be my friend again and i'll be his
 so tell your cousin and bring me word
 what he will do but if he will not yield
 rebuke and dread correction wait on us
 and they shall do their office so be gone
 we will not now be troubled with reply
 we offer fair take it advisedly
 exeunt worcester and vernon
prince henry it will not be accepted on my life
 the douglas and the hotspur both together
 are confident against the world in arms
king henry iv hence therefore every leader to his charge
 for on their answer will we set on them
 and god befriend us as our cause is just
 exeunt all but prince henry and falstaff
falstaff hal if thou see me down in the battle and bestride
 me so tis a point of friendship
prince henry nothing but a colossus can do thee that friendship
 say thy prayers and farewell
falstaff i would twere bedtime hal and all well
prince henry why thou owest god a death
 exit prince henry
falstaff tis not due yet i would be loath to pay him before
 his day what need i be so forward with him that
 calls not on me well tis no matter honour pricks
 me on yea but how if honour prick me off when i
 come on how then can honour set to a leg no or
 an arm no or take away the grief of a wound no
 honour hath no skill in surgery then no what is
 honour a word what is in that word honour what
 is that honour air a trim reckoning who hath it
 he that died o wednesday doth he feel it no
 doth he hear it no tis insensible then yea
 to the dead but will it not live with the living
 no why detraction will not suffer it therefore
 i'll none of it honour is a mere scutcheon and so
 ends my catechism
 exit
 1 king henry iv
act v
scene ii the rebel camp
 enter worcester and vernon
earl of worcester o no my nephew must not know sir richard
 the liberal and kind offer of the king
vernon twere best he did
earl of worcester then are we all undone
 it is not possible it cannot be
 the king should keep his word in loving us
 he will suspect us still and find a time
 to punish this offence in other faults
 suspicion all our lives shall be stuck full of eyes
 for treason is but trusted like the fox
 who ne'er so tame so cherish'd and lock'd up
 will have a wild trick of his ancestors
 look how we can or sad or merrily
 interpretation will misquote our looks
 and we shall feed like oxen at a stall
 the better cherish'd still the nearer death
 my nephew's trespass may be well forgot
 it hath the excuse of youth and heat of blood
 and an adopted name of privilege
 a hairbrain'd hotspur govern'd by a spleen
 all his offences live upon my head
 and on his father's we did train him on
