prospero let them be hunted soundly at this hour
 lie at my mercy all mine enemies
 shortly shall all my labours end and thou
 shalt have the air at freedom for a little
 follow and do me service
 exeunt
 the tempest
act v
scene i before prospero's cell
 enter prospero in his magic robes and ariel
prospero now does my project gather to a head
 my charms crack not my spirits obey and time
 goes upright with his carriage how's the day
ariel on the sixth hour at which time my lord
 you said our work should cease
prospero i did say so
 when first i raised the tempest say my spirit
 how fares the king and's followers
ariel confined together
 in the same fashion as you gave in charge
 just as you left them all prisoners sir
 in the linegrove which weatherfends your cell
 they cannot budge till your release the king
 his brother and yours abide all three distracted
 and the remainder mourning over them
 brimful of sorrow and dismay but chiefly
 him that you term'd sir the good old lord gonzalo'
 his tears run down his beard like winter's drops
 from eaves of reeds your charm so strongly works em
 that if you now beheld them your affections
 would become tender
prospero dost thou think so spirit
ariel mine would sir were i human
prospero and mine shall
 hast thou which art but air a touch a feeling
 of their afflictions and shall not myself
 one of their kind that relish all as sharply
 passion as they be kindlier moved than thou art
 though with their high wrongs i am struck to the quick
 yet with my nobler reason gaitist my fury
 do i take part the rarer action is
 in virtue than in vengeance they being penitent
 the sole drift of my purpose doth extend
 not a frown further go release them ariel
 my charms i'll break their senses i'll restore
 and they shall be themselves
ariel i'll fetch them sir
 exit
prospero ye elves of hills brooks standing lakes and groves
 and ye that on the sands with printless foot
 do chase the ebbing neptune and do fly him
 when he comes back you demipuppets that
 by moonshine do the green sour ringlets make
 whereof the ewe not bites and you whose pastime
 is to make midnight mushrooms that rejoice
 to hear the solemn curfew by whose aid
 weak masters though ye be i have bedimm'd
 the noontide sun call'd forth the mutinous winds
 and twixt the green sea and the azured vault
 set roaring war to the dread rattling thunder
 have i given fire and rifted jove's stout oak
 with his own bolt the strongbased promontory
 have i made shake and by the spurs pluck'd up
 the pine and cedar graves at my command
 have waked their sleepers oped and let em forth
 by my so potent art but this rough magic
 i here abjure and when i have required
 some heavenly music which even now i do
 to work mine end upon their senses that
 this airy charm is for i'll break my staff
 bury it certain fathoms in the earth
 and deeper than did ever plummet sound
 i'll drown my book
 solemn music
 reenter ariel before then alonso with a
 frantic gesture attended by gonzalo
 sebastian and antonio in like manner
 attended by adrian and francisco they all
 enter the circle which prospero had made
 and there stand charmed which prospero
 observing speaks
 a solemn air and the best comforter
 to an unsettled fancy cure thy brains
 now useless boil'd within thy skull there stand
 for you are spellstopp'd
 holy gonzalo honourable man
 mine eyes even sociable to the show of thine
 fall fellowly drops the charm dissolves apace
 and as the morning steals upon the night
 melting the darkness so their rising senses
 begin to chase the ignorant fumes that mantle
 their clearer reason o good gonzalo
 my true preserver and a loyal sir
 to him you follow'st i will pay thy graces
 home both in word and deed most cruelly
 didst thou alonso use me and my daughter
 thy brother was a furtherer in the act
 thou art pinch'd fort now sebastian flesh and blood
 you brother mine that entertain'd ambition
 expell'd remorse and nature who with sebastian
 whose inward pinches therefore are most strong
 would here have kill'd your king i do forgive thee
 unnatural though thou art their understanding
 begins to swell and the approaching tide
 will shortly fill the reasonable shore
 that now lies foul and muddy not one of them
 that yet looks on me or would know me ariel
 fetch me the hat and rapier in my cell
 i will discase me and myself present
 as i was sometime milan quickly spirit
 thou shalt ere long be free
 ariel sings and helps to attire him
 where the bee sucks there suck i
 in a cowslip's bell i lie
 there i couch when owls do cry
 on the bat's back i do fly
 after summer merrily
 merrily merrily shall i live now
 under the blossom that hangs on the bough
prospero why that's my dainty ariel i shall miss thee
 but yet thou shalt have freedom so so so
 to the king's ship invisible as thou art
 there shalt thou find the mariners asleep
 under the hatches the master and the boatswain
 being awake enforce them to this place
 and presently i prithee
ariel i drink the air before me and return
 or ere your pulse twice beat
 exit
gonzalo all torment trouble wonder and amazement
 inhabits here some heavenly power guide us
 out of this fearful country
prospero behold sir king
 the wronged duke of milan prospero
 for more assurance that a living prince
 does now speak to thee i embrace thy body
 and to thee and thy company i bid
 a hearty welcome
alonso whether thou best he or no
 or some enchanted trifle to abuse me
 as late i have been i not know thy pulse
 beats as of flesh and blood and since i saw thee
 the affliction of my mind amends with which
 i fear a madness held me this must crave
 an if this be at all a most strange story
 thy dukedom i resign and do entreat
 thou pardon me my wrongs but how should prospero
 be living and be here
prospero first noble friend
 let me embrace thine age whose honour cannot
 be measured or confined
gonzalo whether this be
 or be not i'll not swear
prospero you do yet taste
 some subtilties o the isle that will not let you
 believe things certain welcome my friends all
 aside to sebastian and antonio
 but you my brace of lords were i so minded
 i here could pluck his highness frown upon you
 and justify you traitors at this time
 i will tell no tales
sebastian aside the devil speaks in him
prospero no
 for you most wicked sir whom to call brother
 would even infect my mouth i do forgive
 thy rankest fault all of them and require
 my dukedom of thee which perforce i know
 thou must restore
alonso if thou be'st prospero
 give us particulars of thy preservation
 how thou hast met us here who three hours since
 were wreck'd upon this shore where i have lost
 how sharp the point of this remembrance is
 my dear son ferdinand
prospero i am woe for't sir
alonso irreparable is the loss and patience
 says it is past her cure
prospero i rather think
 you have not sought her help of whose soft grace
 for the like loss i have her sovereign aid
 and rest myself content
alonso you the like loss
prospero as great to me as late and supportable
 to make the dear loss have i means much weaker
 than you may call to comfort you for i
 have lost my daughter
alonso a daughter
 o heavens that they were living both in naples
 the king and queen there that they were i wish
 myself were mudded in that oozy bed
 where my son lies when did you lose your daughter
prospero in this last tempest i perceive these lords
 at this encounter do so much admire
 that they devour their reason and scarce think
 their eyes do offices of truth their words
 are natural breath but howsoe'er you have
 been justled from your senses know for certain
 that i am prospero and that very duke
 which was thrust forth of milan who most strangely
 upon this shore where you were wreck'd was landed
