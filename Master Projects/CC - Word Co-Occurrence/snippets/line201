 and a most instant tetter bark'd about
 most lazarlike with vile and loathsome crust
 all my smooth body
 thus was i sleeping by a brother's hand
 of life of crown of queen at once dispatch'd
 cut off even in the blossoms of my sin
 unhousel'd disappointed unanel'd
 no reckoning made but sent to my account
 with all my imperfections on my head
 o horrible o horrible most horrible
 if thou hast nature in thee bear it not
 let not the royal bed of denmark be
 a couch for luxury and damned incest
 but howsoever thou pursuest this act
 taint not thy mind nor let thy soul contrive
 against thy mother aught leave her to heaven
 and to those thorns that in her bosom lodge
 to prick and sting her fare thee well at once
 the glowworm shows the matin to be near
 and gins to pale his uneffectual fire
 adieu adieu hamlet remember me
 exit
hamlet o all you host of heaven o earth what else
 and shall i couple hell o fie hold hold my heart
 and you my sinews grow not instant old
 but bear me stiffly up remember thee
 ay thou poor ghost while memory holds a seat
 in this distracted globe remember thee
 yea from the table of my memory
 i'll wipe away all trivial fond records
 all saws of books all forms all pressures past
 that youth and observation copied there
 and thy commandment all alone shall live
 within the book and volume of my brain
 unmix'd with baser matter yes by heaven
 o most pernicious woman
 o villain villain smiling damned villain
 my tablesmeet it is i set it down
 that one may smile and smile and be a villain
 at least i'm sure it may be so in denmark
 writing
 so uncle there you are now to my word
 it is adieu adieu remember me'

 but he's an arrant knave
horatio there needs no ghost my lord come from the grave
 to tell us this
hamlet why right you are i the right
 and so without more circumstance at all
 i hold it fit that we shake hands and part
 you as your business and desire shall point you
 for every man has business and desire
 such as it is and for mine own poor part
 look you i'll go pray
horatio these are but wild and whirling words my lord
hamlet i'm sorry they offend you heartily
 yes faith heartily

 and much offence too touching this vision here

hamlet and therefore as a stranger give it welcome
 there are more things in heaven and earth horatio
 than are dreamt of in your philosophy but come
 here as before never so help you mercy
 how strange or odd soe'er i bear myself
 as i perchance hereafter shall think meet
 to put an antic disposition on
 that you at such times seeing me never shall
 with arms encumber'd thus or this headshake
 or by pronouncing of some doubtful phrase
 as well well we know or we could an if we would'
 or if we list to speak or there be an if they might'
 or such ambiguous giving out to note
 that you know aught of me this not to do
 so grace and mercy at your most need help you swear
ghost beneath swear
hamlet rest rest perturbed spirit
 they swear
 so gentlemen
 with all my love i do commend me to you
 and what so poor a man as hamlet is
 may do to express his love and friending to you
 god willing shall not lack let us go in together
 and still your fingers on your lips i pray
 the time is out of joint o cursed spite
 that ever i was born to set it right
 nay come let's go together
 exeunt
 hamlet
act ii
scene i a room in polonius house
 enter polonius and reynaldo
lord polonius give him this money and these notes reynaldo
reynaldo i will my lord
lord polonius you shall do marvellous wisely good reynaldo
 before you visit him to make inquire
 of his behavior
reynaldo my lord i did intend it
lord polonius marry well said very well said look you sir
 inquire me first what danskers are in paris
 and how and who what means and where they keep
 what company at what expense and finding
 by this encompassment and drift of question
 that they do know my son come you more nearer
 than your particular demands will touch it
 take you as twere some distant knowledge of him
 as thus i know his father and his friends
 and in part him  do you mark this reynaldo
reynaldo ay very well my lord
lord polonius and in part him but you may say not well
 but if't be he i mean he's very wild
 addicted so and so and there put on him
 what forgeries you please marry none so rank
 as may dishonour him take heed of that
 but sir such wanton wild and usual slips
 as are companions noted and most known
 to youth and liberty
reynaldo as gaming my lord
lord polonius ay or drinking fencing swearing quarrelling
 drabbing you may go so far
reynaldo my lord that would dishonour him
lord polonius faith no as you may season it in the charge
 you must not put another scandal on him
 that he is open to incontinency
 that's not my meaning but breathe his faults so quaintly
 that they may seem the taints of liberty
 the flash and outbreak of a fiery mind
 a savageness in unreclaimed blood
 of general assault
reynaldo but my good lord
lord polonius wherefore should you do this
reynaldo ay my lord
 i would know that
lord polonius marry sir here's my drift
 and i believe it is a fetch of wit
 you laying these slight sullies on my son
 as twere a thing a little soil'd i the working mark you
 your party in converse him you would sound
 having ever seen in the prenominate crimes
 the youth you breathe of guilty be assured
 he closes with you in this consequence
 good sir or so or friend or gentleman'
 according to the phrase or the addition
