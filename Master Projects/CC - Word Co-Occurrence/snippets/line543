act iii
scene i before prospero's cell
 enter ferdinand bearing a log
ferdinand there be some sports are painful and their labour
 delight in them sets off some kinds of baseness
 are nobly undergone and most poor matters
 point to rich ends this my mean task
 would be as heavy to me as odious but
 the mistress which i serve quickens what's dead
 and makes my labours pleasures o she is
 ten times more gentle than her father's crabbed
 and he's composed of harshness i must remove
 some thousands of these logs and pile them up
 upon a sore injunction my sweet mistress
 weeps when she sees me work and says such baseness
 had never like executor i forget
 but these sweet thoughts do even refresh my labours
 most busy lest when i do it
 enter miranda and prospero at a distance unseen
miranda alas now pray you
 work not so hard i would the lightning had
 burnt up those logs that you are enjoin'd to pile
 pray set it down and rest you when this burns
 twill weep for having wearied you my father
 is hard at study pray now rest yourself
 he's safe for these three hours
ferdinand o most dear mistress
 the sun will set before i shall discharge
 what i must strive to do
miranda if you'll sit down
 i'll bear your logs the while pray give me that
 i'll carry it to the pile
ferdinand no precious creature
 i had rather crack my sinews break my back
 than you should such dishonour undergo
 while i sit lazy by
miranda it would become me
 as well as it does you and i should do it
 with much more ease for my good will is to it
 and yours it is against
prospero poor worm thou art infected
 this visitation shows it
miranda you look wearily
ferdinand no noble mistress'tis fresh morning with me
 when you are by at night i do beseech you
 chiefly that i might set it in my prayers
 what is your name
miranda mirandao my father
 i have broke your hest to say so
ferdinand admired miranda
 indeed the top of admiration worth
 what's dearest to the world full many a lady
 i have eyed with best regard and many a time
 the harmony of their tongues hath into bondage
 brought my too diligent ear for several virtues
 have i liked several women never any
 with so fun soul but some defect in her
 did quarrel with the noblest grace she owed
 and put it to the foil but you o you
 so perfect and so peerless are created
 of every creature's best
miranda i do not know
 one of my sex no woman's face remember
 save from my glass mine own nor have i seen
 more that i may call men than you good friend
 and my dear father how features are abroad
 i am skilless of but by my modesty
 the jewel in my dower i would not wish
 any companion in the world but you
 nor can imagination form a shape
 besides yourself to like of but i prattle
 something too wildly and my father's precepts
 i therein do forget
ferdinand i am in my condition
 a prince miranda i do think a king
 i would not soand would no more endure
 this wooden slavery than to suffer
 the fleshfly blow my mouth hear my soul speak
 the very instant that i saw you did
 my heart fly to your service there resides
 to make me slave to it and for your sake
 am i this patient logman
miranda do you love me
ferdinand o heaven o earth bear witness to this sound
 and crown what i profess with kind event
 if i speak true if hollowly invert
 what best is boded me to mischief i
 beyond all limit of what else i the world
 do love prize honour you
miranda i am a fool
 to weep at what i am glad of
prospero fair encounter
 of two most rare affections heavens rain grace
 on that which breeds between em
ferdinand wherefore weep you
miranda at mine unworthiness that dare not offer
 what i desire to give and much less take
 what i shall die to want but this is trifling
 and all the more it seeks to hide itself
 the bigger bulk it shows hence bashful cunning
 and prompt me plain and holy innocence
 i am your wife it you will marry me
 if not i'll die your maid to be your fellow
 you may deny me but i'll be your servant
 whether you will or no
ferdinand my mistress dearest
 and i thus humble ever
miranda my husband then
ferdinand ay with a heart as willing
 as bondage e'er of freedom here's my hand
miranda and mine with my heart in't and now farewell
 till half an hour hence
ferdinand a thousand thousand
 exeunt ferdinand and miranda severally
prospero so glad of this as they i cannot be
 who are surprised withal but my rejoicing
 at nothing can be more i'll to my book
 for yet ere suppertime must i perform
 much business appertaining
