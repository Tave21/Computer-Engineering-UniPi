 the chief cause concerns his grace of canterbury
gardiner has he had knowledge of it
cromwell yes
norfolk who waits there
keeper without my noble lords
gardiner yes
keeper my lord archbishop
 and has done half an hour to know your pleasures
chancellor let him come in
keeper your grace may enter now
 cranmer enters and approaches the counciltable
chancellor my good lord archbishop i'm very sorry
 to sit here at this present and behold
 that chair stand empty but we all are men
 in our own natures frail and capable
 of our flesh few are angels out of which frailty
 and want of wisdom you that best should teach us
 have misdemean'd yourself and not a little
 toward the king first then his laws in filling
 the whole realm by your teaching and your chaplains
 for so we are inform'd with new opinions
 divers and dangerous which are heresies
 and not reform'd may prove pernicious
gardiner which reformation must be sudden too
 my noble lords for those that tame wild horses
 pace em not in their hands to make em gentle
 but stop their mouths with stubborn bits and spur em
 till they obey the manage if we suffer
 out of our easiness and childish pity
 to one man's honour this contagious sickness
 farewell all physic and what follows then
 commotions uproars with a general taint
 of the whole state as of late days our neighbours
 the upper germany can dearly witness
 yet freshly pitied in our memories
cranmer my good lords hitherto in all the progress
 both of my life and office i have labour'd
 and with no little study that my teaching
 and the strong course of my authority
 might go one way and safely and the end
 was ever to do well nor is there living
 i speak it with a single heart my lords
 a man that more detests more stirs against
 both in his private conscience and his place
 defacers of a public peace than i do
 pray heaven the king may never find a heart
 with less allegiance in it men that make
 envy and crooked malice nourishment
 dare bite the best i do beseech your lordships
 that in this case of justice my accusers
 be what they will may stand forth face to face
 and freely urge against me
suffolk nay my lord
 that cannot be you are a counsellor
 and by that virtue no man dare accuse you
gardiner my lord because we have business of more moment
 we will be short with you tis his highness pleasure
 and our consent for better trial of you
 from hence you be committed to the tower
 where being but a private man again
 you shall know many dare accuse you boldly
 more than i fear you are provided for
cranmer ah my good lord of winchester i thank you
 you are always my good friend if your will pass
 i shall both find your lordship judge and juror
 you are so merciful i see your end
 tis my undoing love and meekness lord
 become a churchman better than ambition
 win straying souls with modesty again
 cast none away that i shall clear myself
 lay all the weight ye can upon my patience
 i make as little doubt as you do conscience
 in doing daily wrongs i could say more
 but reverence to your calling makes me modest
gardiner my lord my lord you are a sectary
 that's the plain truth your painted gloss discovers
 to men that understand you words and weakness
cromwell my lord of winchester you are a little
 by your good favour too sharp men so noble
 however faulty yet should find respect
 for what they have been tis a cruelty
 to load a falling man
gardiner good master secretary
 i cry your honour mercy you may worst
 of all this table say so
cromwell why my lord
gardiner do not i know you for a favourer
 of this new sect ye are not sound
cromwell not sound
gardiner not sound i say
cromwell would you were half so honest
 men's prayers then would seek you not their fears
gardiner i shall remember this bold language
cromwell do
 remember your bold life too
chancellor this is too much
 forbear for shame my lords
gardiner i have done
cromwell and i
chancellor then thus for you my lord it stands agreed
 i take it by all voices that forthwith
 you be convey'd to the tower a prisoner
 there to remain till the king's further pleasure
 be known unto us are you all agreed lords
all we are
cranmer is there no other way of mercy
 but i must needs to the tower my lords
gardiner what other
 would you expect you are strangely troublesome
 let some o the guard be ready there
 enter guard
cranmer for me
 must i go like a traitor thither
gardiner receive him
 and see him safe i the tower
cranmer stay good my lords
 i have a little yet to say look there my lords
 by virtue of that ring i take my cause
 out of the gripes of cruel men and give it
 to a most noble judge the king my master
chamberlain this is the king's ring
surrey tis no counterfeit
suffolk tis the right ring by heaven i told ye all
 when ye first put this dangerous stone arolling
 twould fall upon ourselves
norfolk do you think my lords
 the king will suffer but the little finger
 of this man to be vex'd
chancellor tis now too certain
 how much more is his life in value with him
 would i were fairly out on't
cromwell my mind gave me
 in seeking tales and informations
 against this man whose honesty the devil
 and his disciples only envy at
 ye blew the fire that burns ye now have at ye
 enter king frowning on them takes his seat
gardiner dread sovereign how much are we bound to heaven
 in daily thanks that gave us such a prince
 not only good and wise but most religious
 one that in all obedience makes the church
 the chief aim of his honour and to strengthen
 that holy duty out of dear respect
 his royal self in judgment comes to hear
 the cause betwixt her and this great offender
king henry viii you were ever good at sudden commendations
 bishop of winchester but know i come not
 to hear such flattery now and in my presence
 they are too thin and bare to hide offences
 to me you cannot reach you play the spaniel
 and think with wagging of your tongue to win me
 but whatsoe'er thou takest me for i'm sure
 thou hast a cruel nature and a bloody
 to cranmer
 good man sit down now let me see the proudest
 he that dares most but wag his finger at thee
 by all that's holy he had better starve
 than but once think this place becomes thee not
surrey may it please your grace
king henry viii no sir it does not please me
 i had thought i had had men of some understanding
 and wisdom of my council but i find none
 was it discretion lords to let this man
 this good manfew of you deserve that title
 this honest man wait like a lousy footboy
 at chamberdoor and one as great as you are
 why what a shame was this did my commission
 bid ye so far forget yourselves i gave ye
 power as he was a counsellor to try him
 not as a groom there's some of ye i see
 more out of malice than integrity
 would try him to the utmost had ye mean
 which ye shall never have while i live
chancellor thus far
 my most dread sovereign may it like your grace
 to let my tongue excuse all what was purposed
 concerning his imprisonment was rather
 if there be faith in men meant for his trial
 and fair purgation to the world than malice
 i'm sure in me
king henry viii well well my lords respect him
 take him and use him well he's worthy of it
 i will say thus much for him if a prince
 may be beholding to a subject i
 am for his love and service so to him
 make me no more ado but all embrace him
 be friends for shame my lords my lord of
 canterbury
 i have a suit which you must not deny me
 that is a fair young maid that yet wants baptism
 you must be godfather and answer for her
cranmer the greatest monarch now alive may glory
 in such an honour how may i deserve it
 that am a poor and humble subject to you
king henry viii come come my lord you'ld spare your spoons you
 shall have two noble partners with you the old
 duchess of norfolk and lady marquess dorset will
 these please you
 once more my lord of winchester i charge you
 embrace and love this man
