 or rudely visit them in parts remote
 to fright them ere destroy but come in
 let me commend thee first to those that shall
 say yea to thy desires a thousand welcomes
 and more a friend than e'er an enemy
 yet marcius that was much your hand most welcome
 exeunt coriolanus and aufidius the two
 servingmen come forward
first servingman here's a strange alteration
second servingman by my hand i had thought to have strucken him with
 a cudgel and yet my mind gave me his clothes made a
 false report of him
first servingman what an arm he has he turned me about with his
 finger and his thumb as one would set up a top
second servingman nay i knew by his face that there was something in
 him he had sir a kind of face methoughti
 cannot tell how to term it
first servingman he had so looking as it werewould i were hanged
 but i thought there was more in him than i could think
second servingman so did i i'll be sworn he is simply the rarest
 man i the world
first servingman i think he is but a greater soldier than he you wot on
second servingman who my master
first servingman nay it's no matter for that
second servingman worth six on him
first servingman nay not so neither but i take him to be the
 greater soldier
second servingman faith look you one cannot tell how to say that
 for the defence of a town our general is excellent
first servingman ay and for an assault too
 reenter third servingman
third servingman o slaves i can tell you news news you rascals
first servingman 
 what what what let's partake
second servingman 
third servingman i would not be a roman of all nations i had as
 lieve be a condemned man
first servingman 
 wherefore wherefore
second servingman 
third servingman why here's he that was wont to thwack our general
 caius marcius
first servingman why do you say thwack our general 
third servingman i do not say thwack our general but he was always
 good enough for him
second servingman come we are fellows and friends he was ever too
 hard for him i have heard him say so himself
first servingman he was too hard for him directly to say the troth
 on't before corioli he scotched him and notched
 him like a carbon ado
second servingman an he had been cannibally given he might have
 broiled and eaten him too
first servingman but more of thy news
third servingman why he is so made on here within as if he were son
 and heir to mars set at upper end o the table no
 question asked him by any of the senators but they
 stand bald before him our general himself makes a
 mistress of him sanctifies himself with's hand and
 turns up the white o the eye to his discourse but
 the bottom of the news is that our general is cut i'
 the middle and but one half of what he was
 yesterday for the other has half by the entreaty
 and grant of the whole table he'll go he says
 and sowl the porter of rome gates by the ears he
 will mow all down before him and leave his passage polled
second servingman and he's as like to do't as any man i can imagine
third servingman do't he will do't for look you sir he has as
 many friends as enemies which friends sir as it
 were durst not look you sir show themselves as
 we term it his friends whilst he's in directitude
first servingman directitude what's that
third servingman but when they shall see sir his crest up again
 and the man in blood they will out of their
 burrows like conies after rain and revel all with
 him
first servingman but when goes this forward
third servingman tomorrow today presently you shall have the
 drum struck up this afternoon tis as it were a
 parcel of their feast and to be executed ere they
 wipe their lips
second servingman why then we shall have a stirring world again
 this peace is nothing but to rust iron increase
 tailors and breed balladmakers
first servingman let me have war say i it exceeds peace as far as
 day does night it's spritely waking audible and
 full of vent peace is a very apoplexy lethargy
 mulled deaf sleepy insensible a getter of more
 bastard children than war's a destroyer of men
second servingman tis so and as war in some sort may be said to
 be a ravisher so it cannot be denied but peace is a
 great maker of cuckolds
first servingman ay and it makes men hate one another
third servingman reason because they then less need one another
 the wars for my money i hope to see romans as cheap
 as volscians they are rising they are rising
all in in in in
 exeunt
 coriolanus
act iv
scene vi rome a public place
 enter sicinius and brutus
sicinius we hear not of him neither need we fear him
 his remedies are tame i the present peace
 and quietness of the people which before
 were in wild hurry here do we make his friends
 blush that the world goes well who rather had
 though they themselves did suffer by't behold
 dissentious numbers pestering streets than see
 our tradesmen with in their shops and going
 about their functions friendly
brutus we stood to't in good time
 enter menenius
 is this menenius
sicinius tis he'tis he o he is grown most kind of late
both tribunes hail sir
menenius hail to you both
sicinius your coriolanus
 is not much miss'd but with his friends
 the commonwealth doth stand and so would do
 were he more angry at it
menenius all's well and might have been much better if
 he could have temporized
sicinius where is he hear you
menenius nay i hear nothing his mother and his wife
 hear nothing from him
 enter three or four citizens
citizens the gods preserve you both
sicinius godden our neighbours
brutus godden to you all godden to you all
first citizen ourselves our wives and children on our knees
 are bound to pray for you both
sicinius live and thrive
brutus farewell kind neighbours we wish'd coriolanus
 had loved you as we did
citizens now the gods keep you
both tribunes farewell farewell
 exeunt citizens
sicinius this is a happier and more comely time
 than when these fellows ran about the streets
 crying confusion
brutus caius marcius was
 a worthy officer i the war but insolent
 o'ercome with pride ambitious past all thinking
 selfloving
sicinius and affecting one sole throne
 without assistance
menenius i think not so
sicinius we should by this to all our lamentation
 if he had gone forth consul found it so
brutus the gods have well prevented it and rome
 sits safe and still without him
 enter an aedile
aedile worthy tribunes
 there is a slave whom we have put in prison
 reports the volsces with two several powers
 are enter'd in the roman territories
 and with the deepest malice of the war
 destroy what lies before em
menenius tis aufidius
 who hearing of our marcius banishment
 thrusts forth his horns again into the world
 which were inshell'd when marcius stood for rome
 and durst not once peep out
sicinius come what talk you
 of marcius
brutus go see this rumourer whipp'd it cannot be
 the volsces dare break with us
menenius cannot be
 we have record that very well it can
 and three examples of the like have been
 within my age but reason with the fellow
 before you punish him where he heard this
 lest you shall chance to whip your information
 and beat the messenger who bids beware
 of what is to be dreaded
sicinius tell not me
 i know this cannot be
brutus not possible
 enter a messenger
messenger the nobles in great earnestness are going
 all to the senatehouse some news is come
 that turns their countenances
sicinius tis this slave
 go whip him fore the people's eyeshis raising
 nothing but his report
messenger yes worthy sir
 the slave's report is seconded and more
 more fearful is deliver'd
sicinius what more fearful
messenger it is spoke freely out of many mouths
 how probable i do not knowthat marcius
 join'd with aufidius leads a power gainst rome
 and vows revenge as spacious as between
 the young'st and oldest thing
sicinius this is most likely
brutus raised only that the weaker sort may wish
 good marcius home again
sicinius the very trick on't
menenius this is unlikely
 he and aufidius can no more atone
