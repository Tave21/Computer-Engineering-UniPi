 and in conclusion she shall watch all night
 and if she chance to nod i'll rail and brawl
 and with the clamour keep her still awake
 this is a way to kill a wife with kindness
 and thus i'll curb her mad and headstrong humour
 he that knows better how to tame a shrew
 now let him speak tis charity to show

 the taming of the shrew
act iv
scene ii padua before baptista's house
 enter tranio and hortensio
tranio is't possible friend licio that mistress bianca
 doth fancy any other but lucentio
 i tell you sir she bears me fair in hand
hortensio sir to satisfy you in what i have said
 stand by and mark the manner of his teaching
 enter bianca and lucentio
lucentio now mistress profit you in what you read
bianca what master read you first resolve me that
lucentio i read that i profess the art to love
bianca and may you prove sir master of your art
lucentio while you sweet dear prove mistress of my heart
hortensio quick proceeders marry now tell me i pray
 you that durst swear at your mistress bianca
 loved none in the world so well as lucentio
tranio o despiteful love unconstant womankind
 i tell thee licio this is wonderful
hortensio mistake no more i am not licio
 nor a musician as i seem to be
 but one that scorn to live in this disguise
 for such a one as leaves a gentleman
 and makes a god of such a cullion
 know sir that i am call'd hortensio
tranio signior hortensio i have often heard
 of your entire affection to bianca
 and since mine eyes are witness of her lightness
 i will with you if you be so contented
 forswear bianca and her love for ever
hortensio see how they kiss and court signior lucentio
 here is my hand and here i firmly vow
 never to woo her no more but do forswear her
 as one unworthy all the former favours
 that i have fondly flatter'd her withal
tranio and here i take the unfeigned oath
 never to marry with her though she would entreat
 fie on her see how beastly she doth court him
hortensio would all the world but he had quite forsworn
 for me that i may surely keep mine oath
 i will be married to a wealthy widow
 ere three days pass which hath as long loved me
 as i have loved this proud disdainful haggard
 and so farewell signior lucentio
 kindness in women not their beauteous looks
 shall win my love and so i take my leave
 in resolution as i swore before
 exit
tranio mistress bianca bless you with such grace
 as longeth to a lover's blessed case
 nay i have ta'en you napping gentle love
 and have forsworn you with hortensio
bianca tranio you jest but have you both forsworn me
tranio mistress we have
lucentio then we are rid of licio
tranio i faith he'll have a lusty widow now
 that shall be wood and wedded in a day
bianca god give him joy
tranio ay and he'll tame her
bianca he says so tranio
tranio faith he is gone unto the tamingschool
bianca the tamingschool what is there such a place
tranio ay mistress and petruchio is the master
 that teacheth tricks eleven and twenty long
 to tame a shrew and charm her chattering tongue
 enter biondello
biondello o master master i have watch'd so long
 that i am dogweary but at last i spied
 an ancient angel coming down the hill
 will serve the turn
tranio what is he biondello
biondello master a mercatante or a pedant
 i know not what but format in apparel
 in gait and countenance surely like a father
lucentio and what of him tranio
tranio if he be credulous and trust my tale
 i'll make him glad to seem vincentio
 and give assurance to baptista minola
 as if he were the right vincentio
 take in your love and then let me alone
 exeunt lucentio and bianca
 enter a pedant
pedant god save you sir
tranio and you sir you are welcome
 travel you far on or are you at the farthest
pedant sir at the farthest for a week or two
 but then up farther and as for as rome
 and so to tripoli if god lend me life
tranio what countryman i pray
pedant of mantua
tranio of mantua sir marry god forbid
 and come to padua careless of your life
pedant my life sir how i pray for that goes hard
tranio tis death for any one in mantua
 to come to padua know you not the cause
 your ships are stay'd at venice and the duke
 for private quarrel twixt your duke and him
 hath publish'd and proclaim'd it openly
 tis marvel but that you are but newly come
 you might have heard it else proclaim'd about
pedant alas sir it is worse for me than so
 for i have bills for money by exchange
 from florence and must here deliver them
tranio well sir to do you courtesy
 this will i do and this i will advise you
 first tell me have you ever been at pisa
pedant ay sir in pisa have i often been
 pisa renowned for grave citizens
tranio among them know you one vincentio
pedant i know him not but i have heard of him
 a merchant of incomparable wealth
tranio he is my father sir and sooth to say
 in countenance somewhat doth resemble you
biondello aside as much as an apple doth an oyster
 and all one
tranio to save your life in this extremity
 this favour will i do you for his sake
 and think it not the worst of an your fortunes
 that you are like to sir vincentio
 his name and credit shall you undertake
 and in my house you shall be friendly lodged
 look that you take upon you as you should
 you understand me sir so shall you stay
 till you have done your business in the city
 if this be courtesy sir accept of it
pedant o sir i do and will repute you ever
 the patron of my life and liberty
tranio then go with me to make the matter good
 this by the way i let you understand
 my father is here look'd for every day
 to pass assurance of a dower in marriage
 twixt me and one baptista's daughter here
 in all these circumstances i'll instruct you
 go with me to clothe you as becomes you

act iv
scene iii a room in petruchio's house
 enter katharina and grumio
grumio no no forsooth i dare not for my life
katharina the more my wrong the more his spite appears
 what did he marry me to famish me
 beggars that come unto my father's door
 upon entreaty have a present aims
 if not elsewhere they meet with charity
 but i who never knew how to entreat
 nor never needed that i should entreat
 am starved for meat giddy for lack of sleep
 with oath kept waking and with brawling fed
 and that which spites me more than all these wants
 he does it under name of perfect love
 as who should say if i should sleep or eat
 twere deadly sickness or else present death
 i prithee go and get me some repast
 i care not what so it be wholesome food
grumio what say you to a neat's foot
katharina tis passing good i prithee let me have it
grumio i fear it is too choleric a meat
 how say you to a fat tripe finely broil'd
katharina i like it well good grumio fetch it me
grumio i cannot tell i fear tis choleric
 what say you to a piece of beef and mustard
katharina a dish that i do love to feed upon
grumio ay but the mustard is too hot a little
katharina why then the beef and let the mustard rest
grumio nay then i will not you shall have the mustard
 or else you get no beef of grumio
katharina then both or one or any thing thou wilt
grumio why then the mustard without the beef
katharina go get thee gone thou false deluding slave
 beats him
 that feed'st me with the very name of meat
 sorrow on thee and all the pack of you
 that triumph thus upon my misery
 go get thee gone i say
 enter petruchio and hortensio with meat
petruchio how fares my kate what sweeting all amort
hortensio mistress what cheer
katharina faith as cold as can be
petruchio pluck up thy spirits look cheerfully upon me
 here love thou see'st how diligent i am
 to dress thy meat myself and bring it thee
 i am sure sweet kate this kindness merits thanks
 what not a word nay then thou lovest it not
 and all my pains is sorted to no proof
 here take away this dish
katharina i pray you let it stand
petruchio the poorest service is repaid with thanks
 and so shall mine before you touch the meat
katharina i thank you sir
hortensio signior petruchio fie you are to blame
