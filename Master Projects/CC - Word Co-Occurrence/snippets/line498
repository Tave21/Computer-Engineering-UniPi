don pedro come lady come you have lost the heart of
 signior benedick
beatrice indeed my lord he lent it me awhile and i gave
 him use for it a double heart for his single one
 marry once before he won it of me with false dice
 therefore your grace may well say i have lost it

beatrice so i would not he should do me my lord lest i
 should prove the mother of fools i have brought
 count claudio whom you sent me to seek
don pedro why how now count wherefore are you sad
claudio not sad my lord

beatrice the count is neither sad nor sick nor merry nor
 well but civil count civil as an orange and
 something of that jealous complexion

 false here claudio i have wooed in thy name and
 fair hero is won i have broke with her father
 and his good will obtained name the day of
 marriage and god give thee joy
leonato count take of me my daughter and with her my
 fortunes his grace hath made the match and an
 grace say amen to it

 but little happy if i could say how much lady as

 with a kiss and let not him speak neither

 the windy side of care my cousin tells him in his
 ear that he is in her heart

 world but i and i am sunburnt i may sit in a
 corner and cry heighho for a husband

 father got excellent husbands if a maid could come by them
don pedro will you have me lady

 workingdays your grace is too costly to wear
 every day but i beseech your grace pardon me i
 was born to speak all mirth and no matter

 was a star danced and under that was i born
 cousins god give you joy

beatrice i cry you mercy uncle by your grace's pardon
 exit
don pedro by my troth a pleasantspirited lady
leonato there's little of the melancholy element in her my
 lord she is never sad but when she sleeps and
 not ever sad then for i have heard my daughter say
 she hath often dreamed of unhappiness and waked
 herself with laughing
don pedro she cannot endure to hear tell of a husband
leonato o by no means she mocks all her wooers out of suit
don pedro she were an excellent wife for benedict
leonato o lord my lord if they were but a week married
 they would talk themselves mad
don pedro county claudio when mean you to go to church
claudio tomorrow my lord time goes on crutches till love
 have all his rites
leonato not till monday my dear son which is hence a just
 sevennight and a time too brief too to have all
 things answer my mind
don pedro come you shake the head at so long a breathing
 but i warrant thee claudio the time shall not go
 dully by us i will in the interim undertake one of
 hercules labours which is to bring signior
 benedick and the lady beatrice into a mountain of
 affection the one with the other i would fain have
 it a match and i doubt not but to fashion it if
 you three will but minister such assistance as i
 shall give you direction
leonato my lord i am for you though it cost me ten
 nights watchings
claudio and i my lord
don pedro and you too gentle hero
hero i will do any modest office my lord to help my
 cousin to a good husband
don pedro and benedick is not the unhopefullest husband that
 i know thus far can i praise him he is of a noble
 strain of approved valour and confirmed honesty i
 will teach you how to humour your cousin that she
 shall fall in love with benedick and i with your
 two helps will so practise on benedick that in
 despite of his quick wit and his queasy stomach he
 shall fall in love with beatrice if we can do this
 cupid is no longer an archer his glory shall be
 ours for we are the only lovegods go in with me
 and i will tell you my drift
 exeunt
 much ado about nothing
act ii
scene ii the same
 enter don john and borachio
don john it is so the count claudio shall marry the
 daughter of leonato
borachio yea my lord but i can cross it
don john any bar any cross any impediment will be
 medicinable to me i am sick in displeasure to him
 and whatsoever comes athwart his affection ranges
 evenly with mine how canst thou cross this marriage
borachio not honestly my lord but so covertly that no
 dishonesty shall appear in me
don john show me briefly how
borachio i think i told your lordship a year since how much
 i am in the favour of margaret the waiting
 gentlewoman to hero
don john i remember
borachio i can at any unseasonable instant of the night
 appoint her to look out at her lady's chamber window
don john what life is in that to be the death of this marriage
borachio the poison of that lies in you to temper go you to
 the prince your brother spare not to tell him that
 he hath wronged his honour in marrying the renowned
 claudiowhose estimation do you mightily hold
 upto a contaminated stale such a one as hero
don john what proof shall i make of that
borachio proof enough to misuse the prince to vex claudio
 to undo hero and kill leonato look you for any
 other issue
don john only to despite them i will endeavour any thing
borachio go then find me a meet hour to draw don pedro and
 the count claudio alone tell them that you know
 that hero loves me intend a kind of zeal both to the
 prince and claudio asin love of your brother's
 honour who hath made this match and his friend's
 reputation who is thus like to be cozened with the
 semblance of a maidthat you have discovered
 thus they will scarcely believe this without trial
 offer them instances which shall bear no less
 likelihood than to see me at her chamberwindow
 hear me call margaret hero hear margaret term me
 claudio and bring them to see this the very night
 before the intended weddingfor in the meantime i
 will so fashion the matter that hero shall be
 absentand there shall appear such seeming truth
 of hero's disloyalty that jealousy shall be called
 assurance and all the preparation overthrown
don john grow this to what adverse issue it can i will put
 it in practise be cunning in the working this and
 thy fee is a thousand ducats
borachio be you constant in the accusation and my cunning
 shall not shame me
don john i will presently go learn their day of marriage
 exeunt
 much ado about nothing
act ii
scene iii leonato's orchard
 enter benedick
benedick boy
 enter boy
boy signior
benedick in my chamberwindow lies a book bring it hither
 to me in the orchard
boy i am here already sir
benedick i know that but i would have thee hence and here again
 exit boy
 i do much wonder that one man seeing how much
 another man is a fool when he dedicates his
 behaviors to love will after he hath laughed at
 such shallow follies in others become the argument
 of his own scorn by failing in love and such a man
 is claudio i have known when there was no music
 with him but the drum and the fife and now had he
 rather hear the tabour and the pipe i have known
 when he would have walked ten mile afoot to see a
 good armour and now will he lie ten nights awake
 carving the fashion of a new doublet he was wont to
 speak plain and to the purpose like an honest man
 and a soldier and now is he turned orthography his
 words are a very fantastical banquet just so many
 strange dishes may i be so converted and see with
 these eyes i cannot tell i think not i will not
 be sworn but love may transform me to an oyster but
 i'll take my oath on it till he have made an oyster
 of me he shall never make me such a fool one woman
 is fair yet i am well another is wise yet i am
 well another virtuous yet i am well but till all
 graces be in one woman one woman shall not come in
 my grace rich she shall be that's certain wise
 or i'll none virtuous or i'll never cheapen her
 fair or i'll never look on her mild or come not
 near me noble or not i for an angel of good
 discourse an excellent musician and her hair shall
 be of what colour it please god ha the prince and
