 i told you what would come of this beseech you
 of your own state take care this dream of mine
 being now awake i'll queen it no inch farther
 but milk my ewes and weep
camillo why how now father
 speak ere thou diest
shepherd i cannot speak nor think
 nor dare to know that which i know o sir
 you have undone a man of fourscore three
 that thought to fill his grave in quiet yea
 to die upon the bed my father died
 to lie close by his honest bones but now
 some hangman must put on my shroud and lay me
 where no priest shovels in dust o cursed wretch
 that knew'st this was the prince
 and wouldst adventure
 to mingle faith with him undone undone
 if i might die within this hour i have lived
 to die when i desire
 exit
florizel why look you so upon me
 i am but sorry not afeard delay'd
 but nothing alter'd what i was i am
 more straining on for plucking back not following
 my leash unwillingly
camillo gracious my lord
 you know your father's temper at this time
 he will allow no speech which i do guess
 you do not purpose to him and as hardly
 will he endure your sight as yet i fear
 then till the fury of his highness settle
 come not before him
florizel i not purpose it
 i think camillo
camillo even he my lord
perdita how often have i told you twould be thus
 how often said my dignity would last
 but till twere known
florizel it cannot fail but by
 the violation of my faith and then
 let nature crush the sides o the earth together
 and mar the seeds within lift up thy looks
 from my succession wipe me father i
 am heir to my affection
camillo be advised
florizel i am and by my fancy if my reason
 will thereto be obedient i have reason
 if not my senses better pleased with madness
 do bid it welcome
camillo this is desperate sir
florizel so call it but it does fulfil my vow
 i needs must think it honesty camillo
 not for bohemia nor the pomp that may
 be thereat glean'd for all the sun sees or
 the close earth wombs or the profound sea hides
 in unknown fathoms will i break my oath
 to this my fair beloved therefore i pray you
 as you have ever been my father's honour'd friend
 when he shall miss meas in faith i mean not
 to see him any morecast your good counsels
 upon his passion let myself and fortune
 tug for the time to come this you may know
 and so deliver i am put to sea
 with her whom here i cannot hold on shore
 and most opportune to our need i have
 a vessel rides fast by but not prepared
 for this design what course i mean to hold
 shall nothing benefit your knowledge nor
 concern me the reporting
camillo o my lord
 i would your spirit were easier for advice
 or stronger for your need
florizel hark perdita
 drawing her aside
 i'll hear you by and by
camillo he's irremoveable
 resolved for flight now were i happy if
 his going i could frame to serve my turn
 save him from danger do him love and honour
 purchase the sight again of dear sicilia
 and that unhappy king my master whom
 i so much thirst to see
florizel now good camillo
 i am so fraught with curious business that
 i leave out ceremony
camillo sir i think
 you have heard of my poor services i the love
 that i have borne your father
florizel very nobly
 have you deserved it is my father's music
 to speak your deeds not little of his care
 to have them recompensed as thought on
camillo well my lord
 if you may please to think i love the king
 and through him what is nearest to him which is
 your gracious self embrace but my direction
 if your more ponderous and settled project
 may suffer alteration on mine honour
 i'll point you where you shall have such receiving
 as shall become your highness where you may
 enjoy your mistress from the whom i see
 there's no disjunction to be made but by
 as heavens forefendyour ruin marry her
 and with my best endeavours in your absence
 your discontenting father strive to qualify
 and bring him up to liking
florizel how camillo
 may this almost a miracle be done
 that i may call thee something more than man
 and after that trust to thee
camillo have you thought on
 a place whereto you'll go
florizel not any yet
 but as the unthoughton accident is guilty
 to what we wildly do so we profess
 ourselves to be the slaves of chance and flies
 of every wind that blows
camillo then list to me
 this follows if you will not change your purpose
 but undergo this flight make for sicilia
 and there present yourself and your fair princess
 for so i see she must be fore leontes
 she shall be habited as it becomes
 the partner of your bed methinks i see
 leontes opening his free arms and weeping
 his welcomes forth asks thee the son forgiveness
 as twere i the father's person kisses the hands
 of your fresh princess o'er and o'er divides him
 twixt his unkindness and his kindness the one
 he chides to hell and bids the other grow
 faster than thought or time
florizel worthy camillo
 what colour for my visitation shall i
 hold up before him
camillo sent by the king your father
 to greet him and to give him comforts sir
 the manner of your bearing towards him with
 what you as from your father shall deliver
 things known betwixt us three i'll write you down
 the which shall point you forth at every sitting
 what you must say that he shall not perceive
 but that you have your father's bosom there
 and speak his very heart
florizel i am bound to you
 there is some sap in this
camillo a cause more promising
 than a wild dedication of yourselves
 to unpath'd waters undream'd shores most certain
 to miseries enough no hope to help you
 but as you shake off one to take another
 nothing so certain as your anchors who
 do their best office if they can but stay you
 where you'll be loath to be besides you know
 prosperity's the very bond of love
 whose fresh complexion and whose heart together
 affliction alters
perdita one of these is true
 i think affliction may subdue the cheek
 but not take in the mind
camillo yea say you so
 there shall not at your father's house these
 seven years
 be born another such
florizel my good camillo
 she is as forward of her breeding as
 she is i the rear our birth
camillo i cannot say tis pity
 she lacks instructions for she seems a mistress
 to most that teach
perdita your pardon sir for this
 i'll blush you thanks
florizel my prettiest perdita
 but o the thorns we stand upon camillo
 preserver of my father now of me
 the medicine of our house how shall we do
 we are not furnish'd like bohemia's son
 nor shall appear in sicilia
camillo my lord
 fear none of this i think you know my fortunes
 do all lie there it shall be so my care
 to have you royally appointed as if
 the scene you play were mine for instance sir
 that you may know you shall not want one word
 they talk aside
 reenter autolycus
autolycus ha ha what a fool honesty is and trust his
 sworn brother a very simple gentleman i have sold
 all my trumpery not a counterfeit stone not a
 ribbon glass pomander brooch tablebook ballad
 knife tape glove shoetie bracelet hornring
 to keep my pack from fasting they throng who
 should buy first as if my trinkets had been
 hallowed and brought a benediction to the buyer
 by which means i saw whose purse was best in
 picture and what i saw to my good use i
 remembered my clown who wants but something to
 be a reasonable man grew so in love with the
 wenches song that he would not stir his pettitoes
 till he had both tune and words which so drew the
 rest of the herd to me that all their other senses
