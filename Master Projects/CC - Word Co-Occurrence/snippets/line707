scene ii the french camp
 enter the dauphin orleans rambures and others
orleans the sun doth gild our armour up my lords
dauphin montez a cheval my horse varlet laquais ha
orleans o brave spirit
dauphin via les eaux et la terre
orleans rien puis l'air et la feu
dauphin ciel cousin orleans
 enter constable
 now my lord constable
constable hark how our steeds for present service neigh
dauphin mount them and make incision in their hides
 that their hot blood may spin in english eyes
 and dout them with superfluous courage ha
rambures what will you have them weep our horses blood
 how shall we then behold their natural tears
 enter messenger
messenger the english are embattled you french peers
constable to horse you gallant princes straight to horse
 do but behold yon poor and starved band
 and your fair show shall suck away their souls
 leaving them but the shales and husks of men
 there is not work enough for all our hands
 scarce blood enough in all their sickly veins
 to give each naked curtleaxe a stain
 that our french gallants shall today draw out
 and sheathe for lack of sport let us but blow on them
 the vapour of our valour will o'erturn them
 tis positive gainst all exceptions lords
 that our superfluous lackeys and our peasants
 who in unnecessary action swarm
 about our squares of battle were enow
 to purge this field of such a hilding foe
 though we upon this mountain's basis by
 took stand for idle speculation
 but that our honours must not what's to say
 a very little little let us do
 and all is done then let the trumpets sound
 the tucket sonance and the note to mount
 for our approach shall so much dare the field
 that england shall couch down in fear and yield
 enter grandpre
grandpre why do you stay so long my lords of france
 yon island carrions desperate of their bones
 illfavouredly become the morning field
 their ragged curtains poorly are let loose
 and our air shakes them passing scornfully
 big mars seems bankrupt in their beggar'd host
 and faintly through a rusty beaver peeps
 the horsemen sit like fixed candlesticks
 with torchstaves in their hand and their poor jades
 lob down their heads dropping the hides and hips
 the gum downroping from their paledead eyes
 and in their pale dull mouths the gimmal bit
 lies foul with chew'd grass still and motionless
 and their executors the knavish crows
 fly o'er them all impatient for their hour
 description cannot suit itself in words
 to demonstrate the life of such a battle
 in life so lifeless as it shows itself
constable they have said their prayers and they stay for death
dauphin shall we go send them dinners and fresh suits
 and give their fasting horses provender
 and after fight with them
constable i stay but for my guidon to the field
 i will the banner from a trumpet take
 and use it for my haste come come away
 the sun is high and we outwear the day

act iv
scene iii the english camp
 enter gloucester bedford exeter erpingham with
 all his host salisbury and westmoreland
gloucester where is the king
bedford the king himself is rode to view their battle
westmoreland of fighting men they have full three score thousand
exeter there's five to one besides they all are fresh
salisbury god's arm strike with us tis a fearful odds
 god be wi you princes all i'll to my charge
 if we no more meet till we meet in heaven
 then joyfully my noble lord of bedford
 my dear lord gloucester and my good lord exeter
 and my kind kinsman warriors all adieu
bedford farewell good salisbury and good luck go with thee
exeter farewell kind lord fight valiantly today
 and yet i do thee wrong to mind thee of it
 for thou art framed of the firm truth of valour
 exit salisbury
bedford he is full of valour as of kindness
 princely in both
 enter the king
westmoreland o that we now had here
 but one ten thousand of those men in england
 that do no work today
king henry v what's he that wishes so
 my cousin westmoreland no my fair cousin
 if we are mark'd to die we are enow
 to do our country loss and if to live
 the fewer men the greater share of honour
 god's will i pray thee wish not one man more
 by jove i am not covetous for gold
 nor care i who doth feed upon my cost
 it yearns me not if men my garments wear
 such outward things dwell not in my desires
 but if it be a sin to covet honour
 i am the most offending soul alive
 no faith my coz wish not a man from england
 god's peace i would not lose so great an honour
 as one man more methinks would share from me
 for the best hope i have o do not wish one more
 rather proclaim it westmoreland through my host
 that he which hath no stomach to this fight
 let him depart his passport shall be made
 and crowns for convoy put into his purse
 we would not die in that man's company
 that fears his fellowship to die with us
 this day is called the feast of crispian
 he that outlives this day and comes safe home
 will stand a tiptoe when the day is named
 and rouse him at the name of crispian
 he that shall live this day and see old age
 will yearly on the vigil feast his neighbours
 and say tomorrow is saint crispian'
 then will he strip his sleeve and show his scars
 and say these wounds i had on crispin's day'
 old men forget yet all shall be forgot
 but he'll remember with advantages
 what feats he did that day then shall our names
 familiar in his mouth as household words
 harry the king bedford and exeter
 warwick and talbot salisbury and gloucester
 be in their flowing cups freshly remember'd
 this story shall the good man teach his son
 and crispin crispian shall ne'er go by
 from this day to the ending of the world
 but we in it shall be remember'd
 we few we happy few we band of brothers
 for he today that sheds his blood with me
 shall be my brother be he ne'er so vile
 this day shall gentle his condition
 and gentlemen in england now abed
 shall think themselves accursed they were not here
 and hold their manhoods cheap whiles any speaks
 that fought with us upon saint crispin's day
 reenter salisbury
salisbury my sovereign lord bestow yourself with speed
 the french are bravely in their battles set
 and will with all expedience charge on us
king henry v all things are ready if our minds be so
westmoreland perish the man whose mind is backward now
king henry v thou dost not wish more help from england coz
westmoreland god's will my liege would you and i alone
 without more help could fight this royal battle
king henry v why now thou hast unwish'd five thousand men
 which likes me better than to wish us one
 you know your places god be with you all
 tucket enter montjoy
montjoy once more i come to know of thee king harry
 if for thy ransom thou wilt now compound
 before thy most assured overthrow
 for certainly thou art so near the gulf
 thou needs must be englutted besides in mercy
 the constable desires thee thou wilt mind
 thy followers of repentance that their souls
 may make a peaceful and a sweet retire
 from off these fields where wretches their poor bodies
 must lie and fester
king henry v who hath sent thee now
montjoy the constable of france
king henry v i pray thee bear my former answer back
 bid them achieve me and then sell my bones
 good god why should they mock poor fellows thus
 the man that once did sell the lion's skin
 while the beast lived was killed with hunting him
 a many of our bodies shall no doubt
 find native graves upon the which i trust
 shall witness live in brass of this day's work
 and those that leave their valiant bones in france
 dying like men though buried in your dunghills
 they shall be famed for there the sun shall greet them
 and draw their honours reeking up to heaven
 leaving their earthly parts to choke your clime
 the smell whereof shall breed a plague in france
 mark then abounding valour in our english
 that being dead like to the bullet's grazing
 break out into a second course of mischief
 killing in relapse of mortality
 let me speak proudly tell the constable
 we are but warriors for the workingday
 our gayness and our gilt are all besmirch'd
 with rainy marching in the painful field
 there's not a piece of feather in our host
 good argument i hope we will not fly
 and time hath worn us into slovenry
 but by the mass our hearts are in the trim
 and my poor soldiers tell me yet ere night
 they'll be in fresher robes or they will pluck
 the gay new coats o'er the french soldiers heads
 and turn them out of service if they do this
