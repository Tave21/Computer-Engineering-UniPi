 and woes by wrong imaginations lose
 the knowledge of themselves

act iv
scene vii a tent in the french camp lear on a bed asleep
 soft music playing gentleman and others attending
 enter cordelia kent and doctor
cordelia o thou good kent how shall i live and work
 to match thy goodness my life will be too short
 and every measure fail me
kent to be acknowledged madam is o'erpaid
 all my reports go with the modest truth
 nor more nor clipp'd but so
cordelia be better suited
 these weeds are memories of those worser hours
 i prithee put them off
kent pardon me dear madam
 yet to be known shortens my made intent
 my boon i make it that you know me not
 till time and i think meet
cordelia then be't so my good lord
 to the doctor
 how does the king
doctor madam sleeps still
cordelia o you kind gods
 cure this great breach in his abused nature
 the untuned and jarring senses o wind up
 of this childchanged father
doctor so please your majesty
 that we may wake the king he hath slept long
cordelia be govern'd by your knowledge and proceed
 i the sway of your own will is he array'd
gentleman ay madam in the heaviness of his sleep
 we put fresh garments on him
doctor be by good madam when we do awake him
 i doubt not of his temperance
cordelia very well
doctor please you draw near louder the music there
cordelia o my dear father restoration hang
 thy medicine on my lips and let this kiss
 repair those violent harms that my two sisters
 have in thy reverence made
kent kind and dear princess
cordelia had you not been their father these white flakes
 had challenged pity of them was this a face
 to be opposed against the warring winds
 to stand against the deep dreadbolted thunder
 in the most terrible and nimble stroke
 of quick cross lightning to watchpoor perdu
 with this thin helm mine enemy's dog
 though he had bit me should have stood that night
 against my fire and wast thou fain poor father
 to hovel thee with swine and rogues forlorn
 in short and musty straw alack alack
 tis wonder that thy life and wits at once
 had not concluded all he wakes speak to him
doctor madam do you tis fittest
cordelia how does my royal lord how fares your majesty
king lear you do me wrong to take me out o the grave
 thou art a soul in bliss but i am bound
 upon a wheel of fire that mine own tears
 do scald like moulten lead
cordelia sir do you know me
king lear you are a spirit i know when did you die
cordelia still still far wide
doctor he's scarce awake let him alone awhile
king lear where have i been where am i fair daylight
 i am mightily abused i should e'en die with pity
 to see another thus i know not what to say
 i will not swear these are my hands let's see
 i feel this pin prick would i were assured
 of my condition
cordelia o look upon me sir
 and hold your hands in benediction o'er me
 no sir you must not kneel
king lear pray do not mock me
 i am a very foolish fond old man
 fourscore and upward not an hour more nor less
 and to deal plainly
 i fear i am not in my perfect mind
 methinks i should know you and know this man
 yet i am doubtful for i am mainly ignorant
 what place this is and all the skill i have
 remembers not these garments nor i know not
 where i did lodge last night do not laugh at me
 for as i am a man i think this lady
 to be my child cordelia
cordelia and so i am i am
king lear be your tears wet yes faith i pray weep not
 if you have poison for me i will drink it
 i know you do not love me for your sisters
 have as i do remember done me wrong
 you have some cause they have not
cordelia no cause no cause
king lear am i in france
kent in your own kingdom sir
king lear do not abuse me
doctor be comforted good madam the great rage
 you see is kill'd in him and yet it is danger
 to make him even o'er the time he has lost
 desire him to go in trouble him no more
 till further settling
cordelia will't please your highness walk
king lear you must bear with me
 pray you now forget and forgive i am old and foolish

act v
scene i the british camp near dover

 gentlemen and soldiers
edmund know of the duke if his last purpose hold
 or whether since he is advised by aught
 to change the course he's full of alteration
 and selfreproving bring his constant pleasure
 to a gentleman who goes out

edmund in honour'd love
regan but have you never found my brother's way

 and bosom'd with her as far as we call hers
edmund no by mine honour madam
regan i never shall endure her dear my lord
 be not familiar with her
edmund fear me not
 she and the duke her husband
 enter with drum and colours albany goneril and soldiers
goneril aside i had rather lose the battle than that sister
 should loosen him and me
albany our very loving sister well bemet
 sir this i hear the king is come to his daughter
 with others whom the rigor of our state
 forced to cry out where i could not be honest
 i never yet was valiant for this business
 it toucheth us as france invades our land
 not bolds the king with others whom i fear
 most just and heavy causes make oppose
edmund sir you speak nobly
regan why is this reason'd
goneril combine together gainst the enemy
 for these domestic and particular broils
 are not the question here
albany let's then determine
 with the ancient of war on our proceedings
edmund i shall attend you presently at your tent
regan sister you'll go with us
goneril no
regan tis most convenient pray you go with us
goneril aside o ho i know the riddlei will go

edgar if e'er your grace had speech with man so poor
 hear me one word
albany i'll overtake you speak
 exeunt all but albany and edgar
edgar before you fight the battle ope this letter
 if you have victory let the trumpet sound
 for him that brought it wretched though i seem
 i can produce a champion that will prove
 what is avouched there if you miscarry
 your business of the world hath so an end
 and machination ceases fortune love you
albany stay till i have read the letter
edgar i was forbid it
 when time shall serve let but the herald cry
 and i'll appear again
albany why fare thee well i will o'erlook thy paper
 exit edgar
 reenter edmund
edmund the enemy's in view draw up your powers
 here is the guess of their true strength and forces
 by diligent discovery but your haste
 is now urged on you
albany we will greet the time
