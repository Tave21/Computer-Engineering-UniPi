 upon the next tree shalt thou hang alive
 till famine cling thee if thy speech be sooth
 i care not if thou dost for me as much
 i pull in resolution and begin
 to doubt the equivocation of the fiend
 that lies like truth fear not till birnam wood
 do come to dunsinane and now a wood
 comes toward dunsinane arm arm and out
 if this which he avouches does appear
 there is nor flying hence nor tarrying here
 i gin to be aweary of the sun
 and wish the estate o the world were now undone
 ring the alarumbell blow wind come wrack
 at least we'll die with harness on our back

 enter young siward
young siward what is thy name
macbeth thou'lt be afraid to hear it
young siward no though thou call'st thyself a hotter name
 than any is in hell
macbeth my name's macbeth
young siward the devil himself could not pronounce a title
 more hateful to mine ear
macbeth no nor more fearful
young siward thou liest abhorred tyrant with my sword
 i'll prove the lie thou speak'st
 they fight and young siward is slain
macbeth thou wast born of woman
 but swords i smile at weapons laugh to scorn
 brandish'd by man that's of a woman born
 exit
 alarums enter macduff
macduff that way the noise is tyrant show thy face
 if thou be'st slain and with no stroke of mine
 my wife and children's ghosts will haunt me still
 i cannot strike at wretched kerns whose arms
 are hired to bear their staves either thou macbeth
 or else my sword with an unbatter'd edge
 i sheathe again undeeded there thou shouldst be
 by this great clatter one of greatest note
 seems bruited let me find him fortune
 and more i beg not
 exit alarums
 enter malcolm and siward
siward this way my lord the castle's gently render'd
 the tyrant's people on both sides do fight
 the noble thanes do bravely in the war

macbeth why should i play the roman fool and die
 on mine own sword whiles i see lives the gashes
 do better upon them
 enter macduff
macduff turn hellhound turn
macbeth of all men else i have avoided thee
 but get thee back my soul is too much charged
 with blood of thine already
macduff i have no words
 my voice is in my sword thou bloodier villain
 than terms can give thee out
 they fight
macbeth thou losest labour
 as easy mayst thou the intrenchant air
 with thy keen sword impress as make me bleed
 let fall thy blade on vulnerable crests
 i bear a charmed life which must not yield
 to one of woman born
macduff despair thy charm
 and let the angel whom thou still hast served
 tell thee macduff was from his mother's womb
 untimely ripp'd
macbeth accursed be that tongue that tells me so
 for it hath cow'd my better part of man
 and be these juggling fiends no more believed
 that palter with us in a double sense
 that keep the word of promise to our ear
 and break it to our hope i'll not fight with thee
macduff then yield thee coward
 and live to be the show and gaze o the time
 we'll have thee as our rarer monsters are
 painted on a pole and underwrit
 here may you see the tyrant'
macbeth i will not yield
 to kiss the ground before young malcolm's feet
 and to be baited with the rabble's curse
 though birnam wood be come to dunsinane
 and thou opposed being of no woman born
 yet i will try the last before my body
 i throw my warlike shield lay on macduff
 and damn'd be him that first cries hold enough'

 malcolm siward ross the other thanes and soldiers
malcolm i would the friends we miss were safe arrived
siward some must go off and yet by these i see
 so great a day as this is cheaply bought
malcolm macduff is missing and your noble son
ross your son my lord has paid a soldier's debt
 he only lived but till he was a man
 the which no sooner had his prowess confirm'd
 in the unshrinking station where he fought
 but like a man he died
siward then he is dead
ross ay and brought off the field your cause of sorrow
 must not be measured by his worth for then
 it hath no end
siward had he his hurts before
ross ay on the front
siward why then god's soldier be he
 had i as many sons as i have hairs
 i would not wish them to a fairer death
 and so his knell is knoll'd
malcolm he's worth more sorrow
 and that i'll spend for him
siward he's worth no more
 they say he parted well and paid his score
 and so god be with him here comes newer comfort
 reenter macduff with macbeth's head
macduff hail king for so thou art behold where stands
 the usurper's cursed head the time is free
 i see thee compass'd with thy kingdom's pearl
 that speak my salutation in their minds
 whose voices i desire aloud with mine
 hail king of scotland
all hail king of scotland
 flourish
malcolm we shall not spend a large expense of time
 before we reckon with your several loves
 and make us even with you my thanes and kinsmen
 henceforth be earls the first that ever scotland
 in such an honour named what's more to do
 which would be planted newly with the time
 as calling home our exiled friends abroad
 that fled the snares of watchful tyranny
 producing forth the cruel ministers
 of this dead butcher and his fiendlike queen
 who as tis thought by self and violent hands
 took off her life this and what needful else
 that calls upon us by the grace of grace
 we will perform in measure time and place
 so thanks to all at once and to each one
 whom we invite to see us crown'd at scone
