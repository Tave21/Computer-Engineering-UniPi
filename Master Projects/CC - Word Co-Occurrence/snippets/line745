bastard o i am scalded with my violent motion
 and spleen of speed to see your majesty
king john o cousin thou art come to set mine eye
 the tackle of my heart is crack'd and burn'd
 and all the shrouds wherewith my life should sail
 are turned to one thread one little hair
 my heart hath one poor string to stay it by
 which holds but till thy news be uttered
 and then all this thou seest is but a clod
 and module of confounded royalty
bastard the dauphin is preparing hitherward
 where heaven he knows how we shall answer him
 for in a night the best part of my power
 as i upon advantage did remove
 were in the washes all unwarily
 devoured by the unexpected flood
 king john dies
salisbury you breathe these dead news in as dead an ear
 my liege my lord but now a king now thus
prince henry even so must i run on and even so stop
 what surety of the world what hope what stay
 when this was now a king and now is clay
bastard art thou gone so i do but stay behind
 to do the office for thee of revenge
 and then my soul shall wait on thee to heaven
 as it on earth hath been thy servant still
 now now you stars that move in your right spheres
 where be your powers show now your mended faiths
 and instantly return with me again
 to push destruction and perpetual shame
 out of the weak door of our fainting land
 straight let us seek or straight we shall be sought
 the dauphin rages at our very heels
salisbury it seems you know not then so much as we
 the cardinal pandulph is within at rest
 who half an hour since came from the dauphin
 and brings from him such offers of our peace
 as we with honour and respect may take
 with purpose presently to leave this war
bastard he will the rather do it when he sees
 ourselves well sinewed to our defence
salisbury nay it is in a manner done already
 for many carriages he hath dispatch'd
 to the seaside and put his cause and quarrel
 to the disposing of the cardinal
 with whom yourself myself and other lords
 if you think meet this afternoon will post
 to consummate this business happily
bastard let it be so and you my noble prince
 with other princes that may best be spared
 shall wait upon your father's funeral
prince henry at worcester must his body be interr'd
 for so he will'd it
bastard thither shall it then
 and happily may your sweet self put on
 the lineal state and glory of the land
 to whom with all submission on my knee
 i do bequeath my faithful services
 and true subjection everlastingly
salisbury and the like tender of our love we make
 to rest without a spot for evermore
prince henry i have a kind soul that would give you thanks
 and knows not how to do it but with tears
bastard o let us pay the time but needful woe
 since it hath been beforehand with our griefs
 this england never did nor never shall
 lie at the proud foot of a conqueror
 but when it first did help to wound itself
 now these her princes are come home again
 come the three corners of the world in arms
 and we shall shock them nought shall make us rue
 if england to itself do rest but true

act i
scene i london king richard ii's palace
 enter king richard ii john of gaunt with other
 nobles and attendants
king richard ii old john of gaunt timehonour'd lancaster
 hast thou according to thy oath and band
 brought hither henry hereford thy bold son
 here to make good the boisterous late appeal
 which then our leisure would not let us hear
 against the duke of norfolk thomas mowbray
john of gaunt i have my liege
king richard ii tell me moreover hast thou sounded him
 if he appeal the duke on ancient malice
 or worthily as a good subject should
 on some known ground of treachery in him
john of gaunt as near as i could sift him on that argument
 on some apparent danger seen in him
 aim'd at your highness no inveterate malice
king richard ii then call them to our presence face to face
 and frowning brow to brow ourselves will hear
 the accuser and the accused freely speak
 highstomach'd are they both and full of ire
 in rage deaf as the sea hasty as fire
 enter henry bolingbroke and thomas mowbray
henry bolingbroke many years of happy days befal
 my gracious sovereign my most loving liege
thomas mowbray each day still better other's happiness
 until the heavens envying earth's good hap
 add an immortal title to your crown
king richard ii we thank you both yet one but flatters us
 as well appeareth by the cause you come
 namely to appeal each other of high treason
 cousin of hereford what dost thou object
 against the duke of norfolk thomas mowbray
henry bolingbroke first heaven be the record to my speech
 in the devotion of a subject's love
 tendering the precious safety of my prince
 and free from other misbegotten hate
 come i appellant to this princely presence
 now thomas mowbray do i turn to thee
 and mark my greeting well for what i speak
 my body shall make good upon this earth
 or my divine soul answer it in heaven
 thou art a traitor and a miscreant
 too good to be so and too bad to live
 since the more fair and crystal is the sky
 the uglier seem the clouds that in it fly
 once more the more to aggravate the note
 with a foul traitor's name stuff i thy throat
 and wish so please my sovereign ere i move
 what my tongue speaks my right drawn sword may prove
thomas mowbray let not my cold words here accuse my zeal
 tis not the trial of a woman's war
 the bitter clamour of two eager tongues
 can arbitrate this cause betwixt us twain
 the blood is hot that must be cool'd for this
 yet can i not of such tame patience boast
 as to be hush'd and nought at all to say
 first the fair reverence of your highness curbs me
 from giving reins and spurs to my free speech
 which else would post until it had return'd
 these terms of treason doubled down his throat
 setting aside his high blood's royalty
 and let him be no kinsman to my liege
 i do defy him and i spit at him
 call him a slanderous coward and a villain
 which to maintain i would allow him odds
 and meet him were i tied to run afoot
 even to the frozen ridges of the alps
 or any other ground inhabitable
 where ever englishman durst set his foot
 mean time let this defend my loyalty
 by all my hopes most falsely doth he lie
henry bolingbroke pale trembling coward there i throw my gage
 disclaiming here the kindred of the king
 and lay aside my high blood's royalty
 which fear not reverence makes thee to except
