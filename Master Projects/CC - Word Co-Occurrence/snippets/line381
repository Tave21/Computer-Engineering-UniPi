 first for his weeping into the needless stream
 poor deer quoth he thou makest a testament
 as worldlings do giving thy sum of more
 to that which had too much then being there alone
 left and abandon'd of his velvet friends
 'tis right quoth he thus misery doth part
 the flux of company anon a careless herd
 full of the pasture jumps along by him
 and never stays to greet him ay quoth jaques
 sweep on you fat and greasy citizens
 tis just the fashion wherefore do you look
 upon that poor and broken bankrupt there'
 thus most invectively he pierceth through
 the body of the country city court
 yea and of this our life swearing that we
 are mere usurpers tyrants and what's worse
 to fright the animals and to kill them up
 in their assign'd and native dwellingplace
duke senior and did you leave him in this contemplation
second lord we did my lord weeping and commenting
 upon the sobbing deer
duke senior show me the place
 i love to cope him in these sullen fits
 for then he's full of matter
first lord i'll bring you to him straight

act ii
scene ii a room in the palace
 enter duke frederick with lords
duke frederick can it be possible that no man saw them
 it cannot be some villains of my court
 are of consent and sufferance in this
first lord i cannot hear of any that did see her
 the ladies her attendants of her chamber
 saw her abed and in the morning early
 they found the bed untreasured of their mistress
second lord my lord the roynish clown at whom so oft
 your grace was wont to laugh is also missing
 hisperia the princess gentlewoman
 confesses that she secretly o'erheard
 your daughter and her cousin much commend
 the parts and graces of the wrestler
 that did but lately foil the sinewy charles
 and she believes wherever they are gone
 that youth is surely in their company
duke frederick send to his brother fetch that gallant hither
 if he be absent bring his brother to me
 i'll make him find him do this suddenly
 and let not search and inquisition quail
 to bring again these foolish runaways

scene iii before oliver's house
 enter orlando and adam meeting
orlando who's there
adam what my young master o my gentle master
 o my sweet master o you memory
 of old sir rowland why what make you here
 why are you virtuous why do people love you
 and wherefore are you gentle strong and valiant
 why would you be so fond to overcome
 the bonny priser of the humorous duke
 your praise is come too swiftly home before you
 know you not master to some kind of men
 their graces serve them but as enemies
 no more do yours your virtues gentle master
 are sanctified and holy traitors to you
 o what a world is this when what is comely
 envenoms him that bears it
orlando why what's the matter
adam o unhappy youth
 come not within these doors within this roof
 the enemy of all your graces lives
 your brotherno no brother yet the son
 yet not the son i will not call him son
 of him i was about to call his father
 hath heard your praises and this night he means
 to burn the lodging where you use to lie
 and you within it if he fail of that
 he will have other means to cut you off
 i overheard him and his practises
 this is no place this house is but a butchery
 abhor it fear it do not enter it
orlando why whither adam wouldst thou have me go
adam no matter whither so you come not here
orlando what wouldst thou have me go and beg my food
 or with a base and boisterous sword enforce
 a thievish living on the common road
 this i must do or know not what to do
 yet this i will not do do how i can
 i rather will subject me to the malice
 of a diverted blood and bloody brother
adam but do not so i have five hundred crowns
 the thrifty hire i saved under your father
 which i did store to be my fosternurse
 when service should in my old limbs lie lame
 and unregarded age in corners thrown
 take that and he that doth the ravens feed
 yea providently caters for the sparrow
 be comfort to my age here is the gold
 and all this i give you let me be your servant
 though i look old yet i am strong and lusty
 for in my youth i never did apply
 hot and rebellious liquors in my blood
 nor did not with unbashful forehead woo
 the means of weakness and debility
 therefore my age is as a lusty winter
 frosty but kindly let me go with you
 i'll do the service of a younger man
 in all your business and necessities
orlando o good old man how well in thee appears
 the constant service of the antique world
 when service sweat for duty not for meed
 thou art not for the fashion of these times
 where none will sweat but for promotion
 and having that do choke their service up
 even with the having it is not so with thee
 but poor old man thou prunest a rotten tree
 that cannot so much as a blossom yield
 in lieu of all thy pains and husbandry
 but come thy ways well go along together
 and ere we have thy youthful wages spent
 we'll light upon some settled low content
adam master go on and i will follow thee
 to the last gasp with truth and loyalty
 from seventeen years till now almost fourscore
 here lived i but now live here no more
 at seventeen years many their fortunes seek
 but at fourscore it is too late a week
 yet fortune cannot recompense me better
 than to die well and not my master's debtor

act ii
scene iv the forest of arden
 enter rosalind for ganymede celia for aliena
 and touchstone
rosalind o jupiter how weary are my spirits
touchstone i care not for my spirits if my legs were not weary
rosalind i could find in my heart to disgrace my man's
 apparel and to cry like a woman but i must comfort
 the weaker vessel as doublet and hose ought to show
 itself courageous to petticoat therefore courage
 good aliena
celia i pray you bear with me i cannot go no further
touchstone for my part i had rather bear with you than bear
 you yet i should bear no cross if i did bear you
 for i think you have no money in your purse
rosalind well this is the forest of arden
touchstone ay now am i in arden the more fool i when i was
 at home i was in a better place but travellers
 must be content
rosalind ay be so good touchstone
 enter corin and silvius
 look you who comes here a young man and an old in
 solemn talk
corin that is the way to make her scorn you still
silvius o corin that thou knew'st how i do love her
corin i partly guess for i have loved ere now
silvius no corin being old thou canst not guess
 though in thy youth thou wast as true a lover
 as ever sigh'd upon a midnight pillow
 but if thy love were ever like to mine
 as sure i think did never man love so
 how many actions most ridiculous
 hast thou been drawn to by thy fantasy
corin into a thousand that i have forgotten
silvius o thou didst then ne'er love so heartily
 if thou remember'st not the slightest folly
 that ever love did make thee run into
 thou hast not loved
 or if thou hast not sat as i do now
 wearying thy hearer in thy mistress praise
 thou hast not loved
 or if thou hast not broke from company
 abruptly as my passion now makes me
 thou hast not loved
 o phebe phebe phebe
 exit
rosalind alas poor shepherd searching of thy wound
 i have by hard adventure found mine own
touchstone and i mine i remember when i was in love i broke
 my sword upon a stone and bid him take that for
 coming anight to jane smile and i remember the
 kissing of her batlet and the cow's dugs that her
 pretty chopt hands had milked and i remember the
 wooing of a peascod instead of her from whom i took
 two cods and giving her them again said with
 weeping tears wear these for my sake we that are
 true lovers run into strange capers but as all is
 mortal in nature so is all nature in love mortal in folly
rosalind thou speakest wiser than thou art ware of
touchstone nay i shall ne'er be ware of mine own wit till i
 break my shins against it
rosalind jove jove this shepherd's passion
 is much upon my fashion
touchstone and mine but it grows something stale with me
celia i pray you one of you question yond man
