juliet by whose direction found'st thou out this place
romeo by love who first did prompt me to inquire
 he lent me counsel and i lent him eyes
 i am no pilot yet wert thou as far
 as that vast shore wash'd with the farthest sea
 i would adventure for such merchandise
juliet thou know'st the mask of night is on my face
 else would a maiden blush bepaint my cheek
 for that which thou hast heard me speak tonight
 fain would i dwell on form fain fain deny
 what i have spoke but farewell compliment
 dost thou love me i know thou wilt say ay'
 and i will take thy word yet if thou swear'st
 thou mayst prove false at lovers perjuries
 then say jove laughs o gentle romeo
 if thou dost love pronounce it faithfully
 or if thou think'st i am too quickly won
 i'll frown and be perverse an say thee nay
 so thou wilt woo but else not for the world
 in truth fair montague i am too fond
 and therefore thou mayst think my havior light
 but trust me gentleman i'll prove more true
 than those that have more cunning to be strange
 i should have been more strange i must confess
 but that thou overheard'st ere i was ware
 my true love's passion therefore pardon me
 and not impute this yielding to light love
 which the dark night hath so discovered
romeo lady by yonder blessed moon i swear
 that tips with silver all these fruittree tops
juliet o swear not by the moon the inconstant moon
 that monthly changes in her circled orb
 lest that thy love prove likewise variable
romeo what shall i swear by
juliet do not swear at all
 or if thou wilt swear by thy gracious self
 which is the god of my idolatry
 and i'll believe thee
romeo if my heart's dear love
juliet well do not swear although i joy in thee
 i have no joy of this contract tonight
 it is too rash too unadvised too sudden
 too like the lightning which doth cease to be
 ere one can say it lightens sweet good night
 this bud of love by summer's ripening breath
 may prove a beauteous flower when next we meet
 good night good night as sweet repose and rest
 come to thy heart as that within my breast
romeo o wilt thou leave me so unsatisfied
juliet what satisfaction canst thou have tonight
romeo the exchange of thy love's faithful vow for mine
juliet i gave thee mine before thou didst request it
 and yet i would it were to give again
romeo wouldst thou withdraw it for what purpose love
juliet but to be frank and give it thee again
 and yet i wish but for the thing i have
 my bounty is as boundless as the sea
 my love as deep the more i give to thee
 the more i have for both are infinite
 nurse calls within
 i hear some noise within dear love adieu
 anon good nurse sweet montague be true
 stay but a little i will come again
 exit above
romeo o blessed blessed night i am afeard
 being in night all this is but a dream
 too flatteringsweet to be substantial
 reenter juliet above
juliet three words dear romeo and good night indeed
 if that thy bent of love be honourable
 thy purpose marriage send me word tomorrow
 by one that i'll procure to come to thee
 where and what time thou wilt perform the rite
 and all my fortunes at thy foot i'll lay
 and follow thee my lord throughout the world
nurse within madam
juliet i come anonbut if thou mean'st not well
 i do beseech thee
nurse within madam
juliet by and by i come
 to cease thy suit and leave me to my grief
 tomorrow will i send
romeo so thrive my soul
juliet a thousand times good night
 exit above
romeo a thousand times the worse to want thy light
 love goes toward love as schoolboys from
 their books
 but love from love toward school with heavy looks
 retiring
 reenter juliet above
juliet hist romeo hist o for a falconer's voice
 to lure this tasselgentle back again
 bondage is hoarse and may not speak aloud
 else would i tear the cave where echo lies
 and make her airy tongue more hoarse than mine
 with repetition of my romeo's name
romeo it is my soul that calls upon my name
 how silversweet sound lovers tongues by night
 like softest music to attending ears
juliet romeo
romeo my dear
juliet at what o'clock tomorrow
 shall i send to thee
romeo at the hour of nine
juliet i will not fail tis twenty years till then
 i have forgot why i did call thee back
romeo let me stand here till thou remember it
juliet i shall forget to have thee still stand there
 remembering how i love thy company
romeo and i'll still stay to have thee still forget
 forgetting any other home but this
juliet tis almost morning i would have thee gone
 and yet no further than a wanton's bird
 who lets it hop a little from her hand
 like a poor prisoner in his twisted gyves
 and with a silk thread plucks it back again
 so lovingjealous of his liberty
romeo i would i were thy bird
juliet sweet so would i
 yet i should kill thee with much cherishing
 good night good night parting is such
 sweet sorrow
 that i shall say good night till it be morrow
 exit above
romeo sleep dwell upon thine eyes peace in thy breast
 would i were sleep and peace so sweet to rest
 hence will i to my ghostly father's cell
 his help to crave and my dear hap to tell
 exit
 romeo and juliet
act ii
scene iii friar laurence's cell
 enter friar laurence with a basket
friar laurence the greyeyed morn smiles on the frowning night
 chequering the eastern clouds with streaks of light
 and flecked darkness like a drunkard reels
 from forth day's path and titan's fiery wheels
 now ere the sun advance his burning eye
 the day to cheer and night's dank dew to dry
 i must upfill this osier cage of ours
 with baleful weeds and preciousjuiced flowers
 the earth that's nature's mother is her tomb
 what is her burying grave that is her womb
 and from her womb children of divers kind
 we sucking on her natural bosom find
 many for many virtues excellent
 none but for some and yet all different
 o mickle is the powerful grace that lies
 in herbs plants stones and their true qualities
 for nought so vile that on the earth doth live
 but to the earth some special good doth give
 nor aught so good but strain'd from that fair use
 revolts from true birth stumbling on abuse
 virtue itself turns vice being misapplied
 and vice sometimes by action dignified
 within the infant rind of this small flower
 poison hath residence and medicine power
 for this being smelt with that part cheers each part
 being tasted slays all senses with the heart
 two such opposed kings encamp them still
 in man as well as herbs grace and rude will
 and where the worser is predominant
 full soon the canker death eats up that plant
 enter romeo
romeo good morrow father
friar laurence benedicite
 what early tongue so sweet saluteth me
 young son it argues a distemper'd head
 so soon to bid good morrow to thy bed
 care keeps his watch in every old man's eye
 and where care lodges sleep will never lie
 but where unbruised youth with unstuff'd brain
 doth couch his limbs there golden sleep doth reign
 therefore thy earliness doth me assure
 thou art uproused by some distemperature
 or if not so then here i hit it right
 our romeo hath not been in bed tonight
romeo that last is true the sweeter rest was mine
friar laurence god pardon sin wast thou with rosaline
romeo with rosaline my ghostly father no
 i have forgot that name and that name's woe
friar laurence that's my good son but where hast thou been then
romeo i'll tell thee ere thou ask it me again
 i have been feasting with mine enemy
 where on a sudden one hath wounded me
 that's by me wounded both our remedies
 within thy help and holy physic lies
 i bear no hatred blessed man for lo
 my intercession likewise steads my foe
friar laurence be plain good son and homely in thy drift
 riddling confession finds but riddling shrift
romeo then plainly know my heart's dear love is set
 on the fair daughter of rich capulet
 as mine on hers so hers is set on mine
 and all combined save what thou must combine
 by holy marriage when and where and how
 we met we woo'd and made exchange of vow
 i'll tell thee as we pass but this i pray
 that thou consent to marry us today
