and thou shalt take the atonement money of the children of israel and shalt appoint it for the service of the tabernacle of the congregation that it may be a memorial unto the children of israel before the lord to make an atonement for your souls
and the lord spake unto moses saying
thou shalt also make a laver of brass and his foot also of brass to wash withal and thou shalt put it between the tabernacle of the congregation and the altar and thou shalt put water therein
for aaron and his sons shall wash their hands and their feet thereat
when they go into the tabernacle of the congregation they shall wash with water that they die not or when they come near to the altar to minister to burn offering made by fire unto the lord
so they shall wash their hands and their feet that they die not and it shall be a statute for ever to them even to him and to his seed throughout their generations
moreover the lord spake unto moses saying
take thou also unto thee principal spices of pure myrrh five hundred shekels and of sweet cinnamon half so much even two hundred and fifty shekels and of sweet calamus two hundred and fifty shekels
and of cassia five hundred shekels after the shekel of the sanctuary and of oil olive an hin
and thou shalt make it an oil of holy ointment an ointment compound after the art of the apothecary it shall be an holy anointing oil
and thou shalt anoint the tabernacle of the congregation therewith and the ark of the testimony
and the table and all his vessels and the candlestick and his vessels and the altar of incense
and the altar of burnt offering with all his vessels and the laver and his foot
and thou shalt sanctify them that they may be most holy whatsoever toucheth them shall be holy
and thou shalt anoint aaron and his sons and consecrate them that they may minister unto me in the priest's office
and thou shalt speak unto the children of israel saying this shall be an holy anointing oil unto me throughout your generations
upon man's flesh shall it not be poured neither shall ye make any other like it after the composition of it it is holy and it shall be holy unto you
whosoever compoundeth any like it or whosoever putteth any of it upon a stranger shall even be cut off from his people
and the lord said unto moses take unto thee sweet spices stacte and onycha and galbanum these sweet spices with pure frankincense of each shall there be a like weight
and thou shalt make it a perfume a confection after the art of the apothecary tempered together pure and holy
and thou shalt beat some of it very small and put of it before the testimony in the tabernacle of the congregation where i will meet with thee it shall be unto you most holy
and as for the perfume which thou shalt make ye shall not make to yourselves according to the composition thereof it shall be unto thee holy for the lord
whosoever shall make like unto that to smell thereto shall even be cut off from his people
and the lord spake unto moses saying
see i have called by name bezaleel the son of uri the son of hur of the tribe of judah
and i have filled him with the spirit of god in wisdom and in understanding and in knowledge and in all manner of workmanship
to devise cunning works to work in gold and in silver and in brass
and in cutting of stones to set them and in carving of timber to work in all manner of workmanship
and i behold i have given with him aholiab the son of ahisamach of the tribe of dan and in the hearts of all that are wise hearted i have put wisdom that they may make all that i have commanded thee
the tabernacle of the congregation and the ark of the testimony and the mercy seat that is thereupon and all the furniture of the tabernacle
and the table and his furniture and the pure candlestick with all his furniture and the altar of incense
and the altar of burnt offering with all his furniture and the laver and his foot
and the cloths of service and the holy garments for aaron the priest and the garments of his sons to minister in the priest's office
and the anointing oil and sweet incense for the holy place according to all that i have commanded thee shall they do
and the lord spake unto moses saying
speak thou also unto the children of israel saying verily my sabbaths ye shall keep for it is a sign between me and you throughout your generations that ye may know that i am the lord that doth sanctify you
ye shall keep the sabbath therefore for it is holy unto you every one that defileth it shall surely be put to death for whosoever doeth any work therein that soul shall be cut off from among his people
six days may work be done but in the seventh is the sabbath of rest holy to the lord whosoever doeth any work in the sabbath day he shall surely be put to death
wherefore the children of israel shall keep the sabbath to observe the sabbath throughout their generations for a perpetual covenant
it is a sign between me and the children of israel for ever for in six days the lord made heaven and earth and on the seventh day he rested and was refreshed
and he gave unto moses when he had made an end of communing with him upon mount sinai two tables of testimony tables of stone written with the finger of god
and when the people saw that moses delayed to come down out of the mount the people gathered themselves together unto aaron and said unto him up make us gods which shall go before us for as for this moses the man that brought us up out of the land of egypt we wot not what is become of him
and aaron said unto them break off the golden earrings which are in the ears of your wives of your sons and of your daughters and bring them unto me
and all the people brake off the golden earrings which were in their ears and brought them unto aaron
and he received them at their hand and fashioned it with a graving tool after he had made it a molten calf and they said these be thy gods o israel which brought thee up out of the land of egypt
and when aaron saw it he built an altar before it and aaron made proclamation and said to morrow is a feast to the lord
and they rose up early on the morrow and offered burnt offerings and brought peace offerings and the people sat down to eat and to drink and rose up to play
and the lord said unto moses go get thee down for thy people which thou broughtest out of the land of egypt have corrupted themselves
they have turned aside quickly out of the way which i commanded them they have made them a molten calf and have worshipped it and have sacrificed thereunto and said these be thy gods o israel which have brought thee up out of the land of egypt
and the lord said unto moses i have seen this people and behold it is a stiffnecked people
now therefore let me alone that my wrath may wax hot against them and that i may consume them and i will make of thee a great nation
and moses besought the lord his god and said lord why doth thy wrath wax hot against thy people which thou hast brought forth out of the land of egypt with great power and with a mighty hand
wherefore should the egyptians speak and say for mischief did he bring them out to slay them in the mountains and to consume them from the face of the earth turn from thy fierce wrath and repent of this evil against thy people
remember abraham isaac and israel thy servants to whom thou swarest by thine own self and saidst unto them i will multiply your seed as the stars of heaven and all this land that i have spoken of will i give unto your seed and they shall inherit it for ever
and the lord repented of the evil which he thought to do unto his people
and moses turned and went down from the mount and the two tables of the testimony were in his hand the tables were written on both their sides on the one side and on the other were they written
and the tables were the work of god and the writing was the writing of god graven upon the tables
and when joshua heard the noise of the people as they shouted he said unto moses there is a noise of war in the camp
and he said it is not the voice of them that shout for mastery neither is it the voice of them that cry for being overcome but the noise of them that sing do i hear
and it came to pass as soon as he came nigh unto the camp that he saw the calf and the dancing and moses anger waxed hot and he cast the tables out of his hands and brake them beneath the mount
and he took the calf which they had made and burnt it in the fire and ground it to powder and strawed it upon the water and made the children of israel drink of it
and moses said unto aaron what did this people unto thee that thou hast brought so great a sin upon them
and aaron said let not the anger of my lord wax hot thou knowest the people that they are set on mischief
for they said unto me make us gods which shall go before us for as for this moses the man that brought us up out of the land of egypt we wot not what is become of him
and i said unto them whosoever hath any gold let them break it off so they gave it me then i cast it into the fire and there came out this calf
and when moses saw that the people were naked for aaron had made them naked unto their shame among their enemies
then moses stood in the gate of the camp and said who is on the lord's side let him come unto me and all the sons of levi gathered themselves together unto him
and he said unto them thus saith the lord god of israel put every man his sword by his side and go in and out from gate to gate throughout the camp and slay every man his brother and every man his companion and every man his neighbour
and the children of levi did according to the word of moses and there fell of the people that day about three thousand men
for moses had said consecrate yourselves today to the lord even every man upon his son and upon his brother that he may bestow upon you a blessing this day
and it came to pass on the morrow that moses said unto the people ye have sinned a great sin and now i will go up unto the lord peradventure i shall make an atonement for your sin
and moses returned unto the lord and said oh this people have sinned a great sin and have made them gods of gold
yet now if thou wilt forgive their sin and if not blot me i pray thee out of thy book which thou hast written
and the lord said unto moses whosoever hath sinned against me him will i blot out of my book
therefore now go lead the people unto the place of which i have spoken unto thee behold mine angel shall go before thee nevertheless in the day when i visit i will visit their sin upon them
and the lord plagued the people because they made the calf which aaron made
and the lord said unto moses depart and go up hence thou and the people which thou hast brought up out of the land of egypt unto the land which i sware unto abraham to isaac and to jacob saying unto thy seed will i give it
and i will send an angel before thee and i will drive out the canaanite the amorite and the hittite and the perizzite the hivite and the jebusite
unto a land flowing with milk and honey for i will not go up in the midst of thee for thou art a stiffnecked people lest i consume thee in the way
and when the people heard these evil tidings they mourned and no man did put on him his ornaments
for the lord had said unto moses say unto the children of israel ye are a stiffnecked people i will come up into the midst of thee in a moment and consume thee therefore now put off thy ornaments from thee that i may know what to do unto thee
and the children of israel stripped themselves of their ornaments by the mount horeb
and moses took the tabernacle and pitched it without the camp afar off from the camp and called it the tabernacle of the congregation and it came to pass that every one which sought the lord went out unto the tabernacle of the congregation which was without the camp
and it came to pass when moses went out unto the tabernacle that all the people rose up and stood every man at his tent door and looked after moses until he was gone into the tabernacle
and it came to pass as moses entered into the tabernacle the cloudy pillar descended and stood at the door of the tabernacle and the lord talked with moses
and all the people saw the cloudy pillar stand at the tabernacle door and all the people rose up and worshipped every man in his tent door
and the lord spake unto moses face to face as a man speaketh unto his friend and he turned again into the camp but his servant joshua the son of nun a young man departed not out of the tabernacle
and moses said unto the lord see thou sayest unto me bring up this people and thou hast not let me know whom thou wilt send with me yet thou hast said i know thee by name and thou hast also found grace in my sight
now therefore i pray thee if i have found grace in thy sight shew me now thy way that i may know thee that i may find grace in thy sight and consider that this nation is thy people
and he said my presence shall go with thee and i will give thee rest
and he said unto him if thy presence go not with me carry us not up hence
for wherein shall it be known here that i and thy people have found grace in thy sight is it not in that thou goest with us so shall we be separated i and thy people from all the people that are upon the face of the earth
and the lord said unto moses i will do this thing also that thou hast spoken for thou hast found grace in my sight and i know thee by name
and he said i beseech thee shew me thy glory
and he said i will make all my goodness pass before thee and i will proclaim the name of the lord before thee and will be gracious to whom i will be gracious and will shew mercy on whom i will shew mercy
and he said thou canst not see my face for there shall no man see me and live
and the lord said behold there is a place by me and thou shalt stand upon a rock
and it shall come to pass while my glory passeth by that i will put thee in a clift of the rock and will cover thee with my hand while i pass by
and i will take away mine hand and thou shalt see my back parts but my face shall not be seen
and the lord said unto moses hew thee two tables of stone like unto the first and i will write upon these tables the words that were in the first tables which thou brakest
and be ready in the morning and come up in the morning unto mount sinai and present thyself there to me in the top of the mount
and no man shall come up with thee neither let any man be seen throughout all the mount neither let the flocks nor herds feed before that mount
and he hewed two tables of stone like unto the first and moses rose up early in the morning and went up unto mount sinai as the lord had commanded him and took in his hand the two tables of stone
and the lord descended in the cloud and stood with him there and proclaimed the name of the lord
and the lord passed by before him and proclaimed the lord the lord god merciful and gracious longsuffering and abundant in goodness and truth
keeping mercy for thousands forgiving iniquity and transgression and sin and that will by no means clear the guilty visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children and upon the children's children unto the third and to the fourth generation
and moses made haste and bowed his head toward the earth and worshipped
and he said if now i have found grace in thy sight o lord let my lord i pray thee go among us for it is a stiffnecked people and pardon our iniquity and our sin and take us for thine inheritance
and he said behold i make a covenant before all thy people i will do marvels such as have not been done in all the earth nor in any nation and all the people among which thou art shall see the work of the lord for it is a terrible thing that i will do with thee
observe thou that which i command thee this day behold i drive out before thee the amorite and the canaanite and the hittite and the perizzite and the hivite and the jebusite
take heed to thyself lest thou make a covenant with the inhabitants of the land whither thou goest lest it be for a snare in the midst of thee
but ye shall destroy their altars break their images and cut down their groves
for thou shalt worship no other god for the lord whose name is jealous is a jealous god
lest thou make a covenant with the inhabitants of the land and they go a whoring after their gods and do sacrifice unto their gods and one call thee and thou eat of his sacrifice
and thou take of their daughters unto thy sons and their daughters go a whoring after their gods and make thy sons go a whoring after their gods
thou shalt make thee no molten gods
the feast of unleavened bread shalt thou keep seven days thou shalt eat unleavened bread as i commanded thee in the time of the month abib for in the month abib thou camest out from egypt
all that openeth the matrix is mine and every firstling among thy cattle whether ox or sheep that is male
but the firstling of an ass thou shalt redeem with a lamb and if thou redeem him not then shalt thou break his neck all the firstborn of thy sons thou shalt redeem and none shall appear before me empty
six days thou shalt work but on the seventh day thou shalt rest in earing time and in harvest thou shalt rest
and thou shalt observe the feast of weeks of the firstfruits of wheat harvest and the feast of ingathering at the year's end
thrice in the year shall all your menchildren appear before the lord god the god of israel
for i will cast out the nations before thee and enlarge thy borders neither shall any man desire thy land when thou shalt go up to appear before the lord thy god thrice in the year
thou shalt not offer the blood of my sacrifice with leaven neither shall the sacrifice of the feast of the passover be left unto the morning
the first of the firstfruits of thy land thou shalt bring unto the house of the lord thy god thou shalt not seethe a kid in his mother's milk
and the lord said unto moses write thou these words for after the tenor of these words i have made a covenant with thee and with israel
and he was there with the lord forty days and forty nights he did neither eat bread nor drink water and he wrote upon the tables the words of the covenant the ten commandments
and it came to pass when moses came down from mount sinai with the two tables of testimony in moses hand when he came down from the mount that moses wist not that the skin of his face shone while he talked with him
and when aaron and all the children of israel saw moses behold the skin of his face shone and they were afraid to come nigh him
and moses called unto them and aaron and all the rulers of the congregation returned unto him and moses talked with them
and afterward all the children of israel came nigh and he gave them in commandment all that the lord had spoken with him in mount sinai
and till moses had done speaking with them he put a vail on his face
but when moses went in before the lord to speak with him he took the vail off until he came out and he came out and spake unto the children of israel that which he was commanded
and the children of israel saw the face of moses that the skin of moses face shone and moses put the vail upon his face again until he went in to speak with him
and moses gathered all the congregation of the children of israel together and said unto them these are the words which the lord hath commanded that ye should do them
six days shall work be done but on the seventh day there shall be to you an holy day a sabbath of rest to the lord whosoever doeth work therein shall be put to death
ye shall kindle no fire throughout your habitations upon the sabbath day
and moses spake unto all the congregation of the children of israel saying this is the thing which the lord commanded saying
take ye from among you an offering unto the lord whosoever is of a willing heart let him bring it an offering of the lord gold and silver and brass
and blue and purple and scarlet and fine linen and goats hair
and rams skins dyed red and badgers skins and shittim wood
and oil for the light and spices for anointing oil and for the sweet incense
and onyx stones and stones to be set for the ephod and for the breastplate
and every wise hearted among you shall come and make all that the lord hath commanded
the tabernacle his tent and his covering his taches and his boards his bars his pillars and his sockets
the ark and the staves thereof with the mercy seat and the vail of the covering
the table and his staves and all his vessels and the shewbread

the pins of the tabernacle and the pins of the court and their cords
the cloths of service to do service in the holy place the holy garments for aaron the priest and the garments of his sons to minister in the priest's office
and all the congregation of the children of israel departed from the presence of moses
and they came every one whose heart stirred him up and every one whom his spirit made willing and they brought the lord's offering to the work of the tabernacle of the congregation and for all his service and for the holy garments
and they came both men and women as many as were willing hearted and brought bracelets and earrings and rings and tablets all jewels of gold and every man that offered offered an offering of gold unto the lord
and every man with whom was found blue and purple and scarlet and fine linen and goats hair and red skins of rams and badgers skins brought them
every one that did offer an offering of silver and brass brought the lord's offering and every man with whom was found shittim wood for any work of the service brought it
and all the women that were wise hearted did spin with their hands and brought that which they had spun both of blue and of purple and of scarlet and of fine linen
and all the women whose heart stirred them up in wisdom spun goats hair
and the rulers brought onyx stones and stones to be set for the ephod and for the breastplate
and spice and oil for the light and for the anointing oil and for the sweet incense
the children of israel brought a willing offering unto the lord every man and woman whose heart made them willing to bring for all manner of work which the lord had commanded to be made by the hand of moses
and moses said unto the children of israel see the lord hath called by name bezaleel the son of uri the son of hur of the tribe of judah
and he hath filled him with the spirit of god in wisdom in understanding and in knowledge and in all manner of workmanship
and to devise curious works to work in gold and in silver and in brass
and in the cutting of stones to set them and in carving of wood to make any manner of cunning work
and he hath put in his heart that he may teach both he and aholiab the son of ahisamach of the tribe of dan
them hath he filled with wisdom of heart to work all manner of work of the engraver and of the cunning workman and of the embroiderer in blue and in purple in scarlet and in fine linen and of the weaver even of them that do any work and of those that devise cunning work
then wrought bezaleel and aholiab and every wise hearted man in whom the lord put wisdom and understanding to know how to work all manner of work for the service of the sanctuary according to all that the lord had commanded
and moses called bezaleel and aholiab and every wise hearted man in whose heart the lord had put wisdom even every one whose heart stirred him up to come unto the work to do it
and they received of moses all the offering which the children of israel had brought for the work of the service of the sanctuary to make it withal and they brought yet unto him free offerings every morning
and all the wise men that wrought all the work of the sanctuary came every man from his work which they made
and they spake unto moses saying the people bring much more than enough for the service of the work which the lord commanded to make
and moses gave commandment and they caused it to be proclaimed throughout the camp saying let neither man nor woman make any more work for the offering of the sanctuary so the people were restrained from bringing
for the stuff they had was sufficient for all the work to make it and too much
and every wise hearted man among them that wrought the work of the tabernacle made ten curtains of fine twined linen and blue and purple and scarlet with cherubims of cunning work made he them
the length of one curtain was twenty and eight cubits and the breadth of one curtain four cubits the curtains were all of one size
and he coupled the five curtains one unto another and the other five curtains he coupled one unto another
and he made loops of blue on the edge of one curtain from the selvedge in the coupling likewise he made in the uttermost side of another curtain in the coupling of the second
fifty loops made he in one curtain and fifty loops made he in the edge of the curtain which was in the coupling of the second the loops held one curtain to another
and he made fifty taches of gold and coupled the curtains one unto another with the taches so it became one tabernacle
and he made curtains of goats hair for the tent over the tabernacle eleven curtains he made them
the length of one curtain was thirty cubits and four cubits was the breadth of one curtain the eleven curtains were of one size
and he coupled five curtains by themselves and six curtains by themselves
and he made fifty loops upon the uttermost edge of the curtain in the coupling and fifty loops made he upon the edge of the curtain which coupleth the second
and he made fifty taches of brass to couple the tent together that it might be one
and he made a covering for the tent of rams skins dyed red and a covering of badgers skins above that
and he made boards for the tabernacle of shittim wood standing up
the length of a board was ten cubits and the breadth of a board one cubit and a half
one board had two tenons equally distant one from another thus did he make for all the boards of the tabernacle
