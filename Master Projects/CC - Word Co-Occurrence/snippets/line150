for this man was counted worthy of more glory than moses inasmuch as he who hath builded the house hath more honour than the house
for every house is builded by some man but he that built all things is god
and moses verily was faithful in all his house as a servant for a testimony of those things which were to be spoken after
but christ as a son over his own house whose house are we if we hold fast the confidence and the rejoicing of the hope firm unto the end
wherefore as the holy ghost saith to day if ye will hear his voice
harden not your hearts as in the provocation in the day of temptation in the wilderness
when your fathers tempted me proved me and saw my works forty years
wherefore i was grieved with that generation and said they do alway err in their heart and they have not known my ways
so i sware in my wrath they shall not enter into my rest
take heed brethren lest there be in any of you an evil heart of unbelief in departing from the living god
but exhort one another daily while it is called to day lest any of you be hardened through the deceitfulness of sin
for we are made partakers of christ if we hold the beginning of our confidence stedfast unto the end
while it is said to day if ye will hear his voice harden not your hearts as in the provocation
for some when they had heard did provoke howbeit not all that came out of egypt by moses
but with whom was he grieved forty years was it not with them that had sinned whose carcases fell in the wilderness
and to whom sware he that they should not enter into his rest but to them that believed not
so we see that they could not enter in because of unbelief
let us therefore fear lest a promise being left us of entering into his rest any of you should seem to come short of it
for unto us was the gospel preached as well as unto them but the word preached did not profit them not being mixed with faith in them that heard it
for we which have believed do enter into rest as he said as i have sworn in my wrath if they shall enter into my rest although the works were finished from the foundation of the world
for he spake in a certain place of the seventh day on this wise and god did rest the seventh day from all his works
and in this place again if they shall enter into my rest
seeing therefore it remaineth that some must enter therein and they to whom it was first preached entered not in because of unbelief
again he limiteth a certain day saying in david to day after so long a time as it is said to day if ye will hear his voice harden not your hearts
for if jesus had given them rest then would he not afterward have spoken of another day
there remaineth therefore a rest to the people of god
for he that is entered into his rest he also hath ceased from his own works as god did from his
let us labour therefore to enter into that rest lest any man fall after the same example of unbelief
for the word of god is quick and powerful and sharper than any twoedged sword piercing even to the dividing asunder of soul and spirit and of the joints and marrow and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart
neither is there any creature that is not manifest in his sight but all things are naked and opened unto the eyes of him with whom we have to do
seeing then that we have a great high priest that is passed into the heavens jesus the son of god let us hold fast our profession
for we have not an high priest which cannot be touched with the feeling of our infirmities but was in all points tempted like as we are yet without sin
let us therefore come boldly unto the throne of grace that we may obtain mercy and find grace to help in time of need
for every high priest taken from among men is ordained for men in things pertaining to god that he may offer both gifts and sacrifices for sins
who can have compassion on the ignorant and on them that are out of the way for that he himself also is compassed with infirmity
and by reason hereof he ought as for the people so also for himself to offer for sins
and no man taketh this honour unto himself but he that is called of god as was aaron
so also christ glorified not himself to be made an high priest but he that said unto him thou art my son to day have i begotten thee
as he saith also in another place thou art a priest for ever after the order of melchisedec
who in the days of his flesh when he had offered up prayers and supplications with strong crying and tears unto him that was able to save him from death and was heard in that he feared
though he were a son yet learned he obedience by the things which he suffered
and being made perfect he became the author of eternal salvation unto all them that obey him
called of god an high priest after the order of melchisedec
of whom we have many things to say and hard to be uttered seeing ye are dull of hearing
for when for the time ye ought to be teachers ye have need that one teach you again which be the first principles of the oracles of god and are become such as have need of milk and not of strong meat
for every one that useth milk is unskilful in the word of righteousness for he is a babe
but strong meat belongeth to them that are of full age even those who by reason of use have their senses exercised to discern both good and evil
therefore leaving the principles of the doctrine of christ let us go on unto perfection not laying again the foundation of repentance from dead works and of faith toward god
of the doctrine of baptisms and of laying on of hands and of resurrection of the dead and of eternal judgment
and this will we do if god permit
for it is impossible for those who were once enlightened and have tasted of the heavenly gift and were made partakers of the holy ghost
and have tasted the good word of god and the powers of the world to come
if they shall fall away to renew them again unto repentance seeing they crucify to themselves the son of god afresh and put him to an open shame
for the earth which drinketh in the rain that cometh oft upon it and bringeth forth herbs meet for them by whom it is dressed receiveth blessing from god
but that which beareth thorns and briers is rejected and is nigh unto cursing whose end is to be burned
but beloved we are persuaded better things of you and things that accompany salvation though we thus speak
for god is not unrighteous to forget your work and labour of love which ye have shewed toward his name in that ye have ministered to the saints and do minister
and we desire that every one of you do shew the same diligence to the full assurance of hope unto the end
that ye be not slothful but followers of them who through faith and patience inherit the promises
for when god made promise to abraham because he could swear by no greater he sware by himself
saying surely blessing i will bless thee and multiplying i will multiply thee
and so after he had patiently endured he obtained the promise
for men verily swear by the greater and an oath for confirmation is to them an end of all strife
wherein god willing more abundantly to shew unto the heirs of promise the immutability of his counsel confirmed it by an oath
that by two immutable things in which it was impossible for god to lie we might have a strong consolation who have fled for refuge to lay hold upon the hope set before us
which hope we have as an anchor of the soul both sure and stedfast and which entereth into that within the veil
whither the forerunner is for us entered even jesus made an high priest for ever after the order of melchisedec
for this melchisedec king of salem priest of the most high god who met abraham returning from the slaughter of the kings and blessed him
to whom also abraham gave a tenth part of all first being by interpretation king of righteousness and after that also king of salem which is king of peace
without father without mother without descent having neither beginning of days nor end of life but made like unto the son of god abideth a priest continually
now consider how great this man was unto whom even the patriarch abraham gave the tenth of the spoils
and verily they that are of the sons of levi who receive the office of the priesthood have a commandment to take tithes of the people according to the law that is of their brethren though they come out of the loins of abraham
but he whose descent is not counted from them received tithes of abraham and blessed him that had the promises
and without all contradiction the less is blessed of the better
and here men that die receive tithes but there he receiveth them of whom it is witnessed that he liveth
and as i may so say levi also who receiveth tithes payed tithes in abraham
for he was yet in the loins of his father when melchisedec met him
if therefore perfection were by the levitical priesthood for under it the people received the law what further need was there that another priest should rise after the order of melchisedec and not be called after the order of aaron
for the priesthood being changed there is made of necessity a change also of the law
for he of whom these things are spoken pertaineth to another tribe of which no man gave attendance at the altar
for it is evident that our lord sprang out of juda of which tribe moses spake nothing concerning priesthood
and it is yet far more evident for that after the similitude of melchisedec there ariseth another priest
who is made not after the law of a carnal commandment but after the power of an endless life
for he testifieth thou art a priest for ever after the order of melchisedec
for there is verily a disannulling of the commandment going before for the weakness and unprofitableness thereof
for the law made nothing perfect but the bringing in of a better hope did by the which we draw nigh unto god
and inasmuch as not without an oath he was made priest
for those priests were made without an oath but this with an oath by him that said unto him the lord sware and will not repent thou art a priest for ever after the order of melchisedec
by so much was jesus made a surety of a better testament
and they truly were many priests because they were not suffered to continue by reason of death
but this man because he continueth ever hath an unchangeable priesthood
wherefore he is able also to save them to the uttermost that come unto god by him seeing he ever liveth to make intercession for them
for such an high priest became us who is holy harmless undefiled separate from sinners and made higher than the heavens
who needeth not daily as those high priests to offer up sacrifice first for his own sins and then for the people's for this he did once when he offered up himself
for the law maketh men high priests which have infirmity but the word of the oath which was since the law maketh the son who is consecrated for evermore
now of the things which we have spoken this is the sum we have such an high priest who is set on the right hand of the throne of the majesty in the heavens
a minister of the sanctuary and of the true tabernacle which the lord pitched and not man
for every high priest is ordained to offer gifts and sacrifices wherefore it is of necessity that this man have somewhat also to offer
for if he were on earth he should not be a priest seeing that there are priests that offer gifts according to the law
who serve unto the example and shadow of heavenly things as moses was admonished of god when he was about to make the tabernacle for see saith he that thou make all things according to the pattern shewed to thee in the mount
but now hath he obtained a more excellent ministry by how much also he is the mediator of a better covenant which was established upon better promises
for if that first covenant had been faultless then should no place have been sought for the second
for finding fault with them he saith behold the days come saith the lord when i will make a new covenant with the house of israel and with the house of judah
not according to the covenant that i made with their fathers in the day when i took them by the hand to lead them out of the land of egypt because they continued not in my covenant and i regarded them not saith the lord
for this is the covenant that i will make with the house of israel after those days saith the lord i will put my laws into their mind and write them in their hearts and i will be to them a god and they shall be to me a people
and they shall not teach every man his neighbour and every man his brother saying know the lord for all shall know me from the least to the greatest
for i will be merciful to their unrighteousness and their sins and their iniquities will i remember no more
in that he saith a new covenant he hath made the first old now that which decayeth and waxeth old is ready to vanish away
then verily the first covenant had also ordinances of divine service and a worldly sanctuary
for there was a tabernacle made the first wherein was the candlestick and the table and the shewbread which is called the sanctuary
and after the second veil the tabernacle which is called the holiest of all
which had the golden censer and the ark of the covenant overlaid round about with gold wherein was the golden pot that had manna and aaron's rod that budded and the tables of the covenant
and over it the cherubims of glory shadowing the mercyseat of which we cannot now speak particularly
now when these things were thus ordained the priests went always into the first tabernacle accomplishing the service of god
but into the second went the high priest alone once every year not without blood which he offered for himself and for the errors of the people
the holy ghost this signifying that the way into the holiest of all was not yet made manifest while as the first tabernacle was yet standing
which was a figure for the time then present in which were offered both gifts and sacrifices that could not make him that did the service perfect as pertaining to the conscience
which stood only in meats and drinks and divers washings and carnal ordinances imposed on them until the time of reformation
but christ being come an high priest of good things to come by a greater and more perfect tabernacle not made with hands that is to say not of this building
neither by the blood of goats and calves but by his own blood he entered in once into the holy place having obtained eternal redemption for us
for if the blood of bulls and of goats and the ashes of an heifer sprinkling the unclean sanctifieth to the purifying of the flesh
how much more shall the blood of christ who through the eternal spirit offered himself without spot to god purge your conscience from dead works to serve the living god
and for this cause he is the mediator of the new testament that by means of death for the redemption of the transgressions that were under the first testament they which are called might receive the promise of eternal inheritance
for where a testament is there must also of necessity be the death of the testator
for a testament is of force after men are dead otherwise it is of no strength at all while the testator liveth
whereupon neither the first testament was dedicated without blood
for when moses had spoken every precept to all the people according to the law he took the blood of calves and of goats with water and scarlet wool and hyssop and sprinkled both the book and all the people
saying this is the blood of the testament which god hath enjoined unto you
moreover he sprinkled with blood both the tabernacle and all the vessels of the ministry
and almost all things are by the law purged with blood and without shedding of blood is no remission
it was therefore necessary that the patterns of things in the heavens should be purified with these but the heavenly things themselves with better sacrifices than these
for christ is not entered into the holy places made with hands which are the figures of the true but into heaven itself now to appear in the presence of god for us
nor yet that he should offer himself often as the high priest entereth into the holy place every year with blood of others
for then must he often have suffered since the foundation of the world but now once in the end of the world hath he appeared to put away sin by the sacrifice of himself
and as it is appointed unto men once to die but after this the judgment
so christ was once offered to bear the sins of many and unto them that look for him shall he appear the second time without sin unto salvation
for the law having a shadow of good things to come and not the very image of the things can never with those sacrifices which they offered year by year continually make the comers thereunto perfect
for then would they not have ceased to be offered because that the worshippers once purged should have had no more conscience of sins
but in those sacrifices there is a remembrance again made of sins every year
for it is not possible that the blood of bulls and of goats should take away sins
wherefore when he cometh into the world he saith sacrifice and offering thou wouldest not but a body hast thou prepared me
in burnt offerings and sacrifices for sin thou hast had no pleasure
then said i lo i come in the volume of the book it is written of me to do thy will o god
above when he said sacrifice and offering and burnt offerings and offering for sin thou wouldest not neither hadst pleasure therein which are offered by the law
then said he lo i come to do thy will o god he taketh away the first that he may establish the second
by the which will we are sanctified through the offering of the body of jesus christ once for all
and every priest standeth daily ministering and offering oftentimes the same sacrifices which can never take away sins
but this man after he had offered one sacrifice for sins for ever sat down on the right hand of god
from henceforth expecting till his enemies be made his footstool
for by one offering he hath perfected for ever them that are sanctified
whereof the holy ghost also is a witness to us for after that he had said before
this is the covenant that i will make with them after those days saith the lord i will put my laws into their hearts and in their minds will i write them
and their sins and iniquities will i remember no more
now where remission of these is there is no more offering for sin
having therefore brethren boldness to enter into the holiest by the blood of jesus
by a new and living way which he hath consecrated for us through the veil that is to say his flesh
and having an high priest over the house of god
let us draw near with a true heart in full assurance of faith having our hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience and our bodies washed with pure water
let us hold fast the profession of our faith without wavering for he is faithful that promised
and let us consider one another to provoke unto love and to good works
not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together as the manner of some is but exhorting one another and so much the more as ye see the day approaching
for if we sin wilfully after that we have received the knowledge of the truth there remaineth no more sacrifice for sins
but a certain fearful looking for of judgment and fiery indignation which shall devour the adversaries
he that despised moses law died without mercy under two or three witnesses
of how much sorer punishment suppose ye shall he be thought worthy who hath trodden under foot the son of god and hath counted the blood of the covenant wherewith he was sanctified an unholy thing and hath done despite unto the spirit of grace
for we know him that hath said vengeance belongeth unto me i will recompense saith the lord and again the lord shall judge his people
it is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living god
but call to remembrance the former days in which after ye were illuminated ye endured a great fight of afflictions
partly whilst ye were made a gazingstock both by reproaches and afflictions and partly whilst ye became companions of them that were so used
for ye had compassion of me in my bonds and took joyfully the spoiling of your goods knowing in yourselves that ye have in heaven a better and an enduring substance
cast not away therefore your confidence which hath great recompence of reward
for ye have need of patience that after ye have done the will of god ye might receive the promise
for yet a little while and he that shall come will come and will not tarry
now the just shall live by faith but if any man draw back my soul shall have no pleasure in him
but we are not of them who draw back unto perdition but of them that believe to the saving of the soul
now faith is the substance of things hoped for the evidence of things not seen
for by it the elders obtained a good report
through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of god so that things which are seen were not made of things which do appear
by faith abel offered unto god a more excellent sacrifice than cain by which he obtained witness that he was righteous god testifying of his gifts and by it he being dead yet speaketh
by faith enoch was translated that he should not see death and was not found because god had translated him for before his translation he had this testimony that he pleased god
but without faith it is impossible to please him for he that cometh to god must believe that he is and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him
by faith noah being warned of god of things not seen as yet moved with fear prepared an ark to the saving of his house by the which he condemned the world and became heir of the righteousness which is by faith
by faith abraham when he was called to go out into a place which he should after receive for an inheritance obeyed and he went out not knowing whither he went
by faith he sojourned in the land of promise as in a strange country dwelling in tabernacles with isaac and jacob the heirs with him of the same promise
for he looked for a city which hath foundations whose builder and maker is god
through faith also sara herself received strength to conceive seed and was delivered of a child when she was past age because she judged him faithful who had promised
therefore sprang there even of one and him as good as dead so many as the stars of the sky in multitude and as the sand which is by the sea shore innumerable
these all died in faith not having received the promises but having seen them afar off and were persuaded of them and embraced them and confessed that they were strangers and pilgrims on the earth
for they that say such things declare plainly that they seek a country
and truly if they had been mindful of that country from whence they came out they might have had opportunity to have returned
but now they desire a better country that is an heavenly wherefore god is not ashamed to be called their god for he hath prepared for them a city
by faith abraham when he was tried offered up isaac and he that had received the promises offered up his only begotten son
of whom it was said that in isaac shall thy seed be called
accounting that god was able to raise him up even from the dead from whence also he received him in a figure
by faith isaac blessed jacob and esau concerning things to come
by faith jacob when he was a dying blessed both the sons of joseph and worshipped leaning upon the top of his staff
by faith joseph when he died made mention of the departing of the children of israel and gave commandment concerning his bones
by faith moses when he was born was hid three months of his parents because they saw he was a proper child and they were not afraid of the king's commandment
by faith moses when he was come to years refused to be called the son of pharaoh's daughter
choosing rather to suffer affliction with the people of god than to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a season
