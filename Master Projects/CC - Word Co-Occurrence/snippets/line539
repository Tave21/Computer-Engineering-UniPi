 when i arrived and heard thee that made gape
 the pine and let thee out
ariel i thank thee master
prospero if thou more murmur'st i will rend an oak
 and peg thee in his knotty entrails till
 thou hast howl'd away twelve winters
ariel pardon master
 i will be correspondent to command
 and do my spiriting gently
prospero do so and after two days
 i will discharge thee
ariel that's my noble master
 what shall i do say what what shall i do
prospero go make thyself like a nymph o the sea be subject
 to no sight but thine and mine invisible
 to every eyeball else go take this shape
 and hither come in't go hence with diligence
 exit ariel
 awake dear heart awake thou hast slept well awake
miranda the strangeness of your story put
 heaviness in me
prospero shake it off come on
 we'll visit caliban my slave who never
 yields us kind answer
miranda tis a villain sir
 i do not love to look on
prospero but as tis
 we cannot miss him he does make our fire
 fetch in our wood and serves in offices
 that profit us what ho slave caliban
 thou earth thou speak
caliban within there's wood enough within
prospero come forth i say there's other business for thee
 come thou tortoise when
 reenter ariel like a waternymph
 fine apparition my quaint ariel
 hark in thine ear
ariel my lord it shall be done
 exit
prospero thou poisonous slave got by the devil himself
 upon thy wicked dam come forth
 enter caliban
caliban as wicked dew as e'er my mother brush'd
 with raven's feather from unwholesome fen
 drop on you both a southwest blow on ye
 and blister you all o'er
prospero for this be sure tonight thou shalt have cramps
 sidestitches that shall pen thy breath up urchins
 shall for that vast of night that they may work
 all exercise on thee thou shalt be pinch'd
 as thick as honeycomb each pinch more stinging
 than bees that made em
caliban i must eat my dinner
 this island's mine by sycorax my mother
 which thou takest from me when thou camest first
 thou strokedst me and madest much of me wouldst give me
 water with berries in't and teach me how
 to name the bigger light and how the less
 that burn by day and night and then i loved thee
 and show'd thee all the qualities o the isle
 the fresh springs brinepits barren place and fertile
 cursed be i that did so all the charms
 of sycorax toads beetles bats light on you
 for i am all the subjects that you have
 which first was mine own king and here you sty me
 in this hard rock whiles you do keep from me
 the rest o the island
prospero thou most lying slave
 whom stripes may move not kindness i have used thee
 filth as thou art with human care and lodged thee
 in mine own cell till thou didst seek to violate
 the honour of my child
caliban o ho o ho would't had been done
 thou didst prevent me i had peopled else
 this isle with calibans
prospero abhorred slave
 which any print of goodness wilt not take
 being capable of all ill i pitied thee
 took pains to make thee speak taught thee each hour
 one thing or other when thou didst not savage
 know thine own meaning but wouldst gabble like
 a thing most brutish i endow'd thy purposes
 with words that made them known but thy vile race
 though thou didst learn had that in't which
 good natures
 could not abide to be with therefore wast thou
 deservedly confined into this rock
 who hadst deserved more than a prison
caliban you taught me language and my profit on't
 is i know how to curse the red plague rid you
 for learning me your language
prospero hagseed hence
 fetch us in fuel and be quick thou'rt best
 to answer other business shrug'st thou malice
 if thou neglect'st or dost unwillingly
 what i command i'll rack thee with old cramps
 fill all thy bones with aches make thee roar
 that beasts shall tremble at thy din
caliban no pray thee
 aside
 i must obey his art is of such power
 it would control my dam's god setebos
 and make a vassal of him
prospero so slave hence
 exit caliban
 reenter ariel invisible playing and singing
 ferdinand following
 ariel's song
 come unto these yellow sands
 and then take hands
 courtsied when you have and kiss'd
 the wild waves whist
 foot it featly here and there
 and sweet sprites the burthen bear
 hark hark
 burthen dispersedly within bowwow
 the watchdogs bark
 burthen bowwow
 hark hark i hear
 the strain of strutting chanticleer
 cry cockadiddledow
ferdinand where should this music be i the air or the earth
 it sounds no more and sure it waits upon
 some god o the island sitting on a bank
 weeping again the king my father's wreck
 this music crept by me upon the waters
 allaying both their fury and my passion
 with its sweet air thence i have follow'd it
 or it hath drawn me rather but tis gone
 no it begins again
 ariel sings
 full fathom five thy father lies
 of his bones are coral made
 those are pearls that were his eyes
 nothing of him that doth fade
 but doth suffer a seachange
 into something rich and strange
 seanymphs hourly ring his knell
 burthen dingdong
 hark now i hear themdingdong bell
ferdinand the ditty does remember my drown'd father
 this is no mortal business nor no sound
 that the earth owes i hear it now above me
prospero the fringed curtains of thine eye advance
 and say what thou seest yond
miranda what is't a spirit
 lord how it looks about believe me sir
 it carries a brave form but tis a spirit
prospero no wench it eats and sleeps and hath such senses
 as we have such this gallant which thou seest
 was in the wreck and but he's something stain'd
 with grief that's beauty's canker thou mightst call him
 a goodly person he hath lost his fellows
 and strays about to find em
miranda i might call him
 a thing divine for nothing natural
 i ever saw so noble
prospero aside it goes on i see
 as my soul prompts it spirit fine spirit i'll free thee
 within two days for this
ferdinand most sure the goddess
 on whom these airs attend vouchsafe my prayer
 may know if you remain upon this island
 and that you will some good instruction give
 how i may bear me here my prime request
 which i do last pronounce is o you wonder
 if you be maid or no
miranda no wonder sir
 but certainly a maid
ferdinand my language heavens
 i am the best of them that speak this speech
 were i but where tis spoken
prospero how the best
 what wert thou if the king of naples heard thee
ferdinand a single thing as i am now that wonders
 to hear thee speak of naples he does hear me
 and that he does i weep myself am naples
 who with mine eyes never since at ebb beheld
 the king my father wreck'd
miranda alack for mercy
ferdinand yes faith and all his lords the duke of milan
 and his brave son being twain
prospero aside the duke of milan
 and his more braver daughter could control thee
 if now twere fit to do't at the first sight
 they have changed eyes delicate ariel
 i'll set thee free for this
 to ferdinand
 a word good sir
 i fear you have done yourself some wrong a word
miranda why speaks my father so ungently this
 is the third man that e'er i saw the first
 that e'er i sigh'd for pity move my father
 to be inclined my way
ferdinand o if a virgin
 and your affection not gone forth i'll make you
 the queen of naples
prospero soft sir one word more
 aside
 they are both in either's powers but this swift business
