act i
scene vii macbeth's castle
 hautboys and torches enter a sewer and divers
 servants with dishes and service and pass over the
 stage then enter macbeth
macbeth if it were done when tis done then twere well
 it were done quickly if the assassination
 could trammel up the consequence and catch
 with his surcease success that but this blow
 might be the beall and the endall here
 but here upon this bank and shoal of time
 we'ld jump the life to come but in these cases
 we still have judgment here that we but teach
 bloody instructions which being taught return
 to plague the inventor this evenhanded justice
 commends the ingredients of our poison'd chalice
 to our own lips he's here in double trust
 first as i am his kinsman and his subject
 strong both against the deed then as his host
 who should against his murderer shut the door
 not bear the knife myself besides this duncan
 hath borne his faculties so meek hath been
 so clear in his great office that his virtues
 will plead like angels trumpettongued against
 the deep damnation of his takingoff
 and pity like a naked newborn babe
 striding the blast or heaven's cherubim horsed
 upon the sightless couriers of the air
 shall blow the horrid deed in every eye
 that tears shall drown the wind i have no spur
 to prick the sides of my intent but only
 vaulting ambition which o'erleaps itself
 and falls on the other
 enter lady macbeth
 how now what news
lady macbeth he has almost supp'd why have you left the chamber
macbeth hath he ask'd for me
lady macbeth know you not he has
macbeth we will proceed no further in this business
 he hath honour'd me of late and i have bought
 golden opinions from all sorts of people
 which would be worn now in their newest gloss
 not cast aside so soon
lady macbeth was the hope drunk
 wherein you dress'd yourself hath it slept since
 and wakes it now to look so green and pale
 at what it did so freely from this time
 such i account thy love art thou afeard
 to be the same in thine own act and valour
 as thou art in desire wouldst thou have that
 which thou esteem'st the ornament of life
 and live a coward in thine own esteem
 letting i dare not wait upon i would'
 like the poor cat i the adage
macbeth prithee peace
 i dare do all that may become a man
 who dares do more is none
lady macbeth what beast was't then
 that made you break this enterprise to me
 when you durst do it then you were a man
 and to be more than what you were you would
 be so much more the man nor time nor place
 did then adhere and yet you would make both
 they have made themselves and that their fitness now
 does unmake you i have given suck and know
 how tender tis to love the babe that milks me
 i would while it was smiling in my face
 have pluck'd my nipple from his boneless gums
 and dash'd the brains out had i so sworn as you
 have done to this
macbeth if we should fail
lady macbeth we fail
 but screw your courage to the stickingplace
 and we'll not fail when duncan is asleep
 whereto the rather shall his day's hard journey
 soundly invite himhis two chamberlains
 will i with wine and wassail so convince
 that memory the warder of the brain
 shall be a fume and the receipt of reason
 a limbeck only when in swinish sleep
 their drenched natures lie as in a death
 what cannot you and i perform upon
 the unguarded duncan what not put upon
 his spongy officers who shall bear the guilt
 of our great quell
macbeth bring forth menchildren only
 for thy undaunted mettle should compose
 nothing but males will it not be received
 when we have mark'd with blood those sleepy two
 of his own chamber and used their very daggers
 that they have done't
lady macbeth who dares receive it other
 as we shall make our griefs and clamour roar
 upon his death
macbeth i am settled and bend up
 each corporal agent to this terrible feat
 away and mock the time with fairest show
 false face must hide what the false heart doth know

act ii
scene i court of macbeth's castle
 enter banquo and fleance bearing a torch before him
banquo how goes the night boy
fleance the moon is down i have not heard the clock
banquo and she goes down at twelve
fleance i take't tis later sir
banquo hold take my sword there's husbandry in heaven
 their candles are all out take thee that too
 a heavy summons lies like lead upon me
 and yet i would not sleep merciful powers
 restrain in me the cursed thoughts that nature
 gives way to in repose
 enter macbeth and a servant with a torch
 give me my sword
 who's there
macbeth a friend
banquo what sir not yet at rest the king's abed
 he hath been in unusual pleasure and
 sent forth great largess to your offices
 this diamond he greets your wife withal
 by the name of most kind hostess and shut up
 in measureless content
macbeth being unprepared
 our will became the servant to defect
 which else should free have wrought
banquo all's well
 i dreamt last night of the three weird sisters
 to you they have show'd some truth
macbeth i think not of them
 yet when we can entreat an hour to serve
 we would spend it in some words upon that business
 if you would grant the time
banquo at your kind'st leisure
macbeth if you shall cleave to my consent when tis
 it shall make honour for you
banquo so i lose none
 in seeking to augment it but still keep
 my bosom franchised and allegiance clear
 i shall be counsell'd
macbeth good repose the while
banquo thanks sir the like to you
 exeunt banquo and fleance
macbeth go bid thy mistress when my drink is ready
 she strike upon the bell get thee to bed
 exit servant
 is this a dagger which i see before me
 the handle toward my hand come let me clutch thee
 i have thee not and yet i see thee still
 art thou not fatal vision sensible
 to feeling as to sight or art thou but
 a dagger of the mind a false creation
 proceeding from the heatoppressed brain
 i see thee yet in form as palpable
 as this which now i draw
 thou marshall'st me the way that i was going
 and such an instrument i was to use
 mine eyes are made the fools o the other senses
 or else worth all the rest i see thee still
 and on thy blade and dudgeon gouts of blood
 which was not so before there's no such thing
 it is the bloody business which informs
 thus to mine eyes now o'er the one halfworld
 nature seems dead and wicked dreams abuse
 the curtain'd sleep witchcraft celebrates
 pale hecate's offerings and wither'd murder
 alarum'd by his sentinel the wolf
 whose howl's his watch thus with his stealthy pace
 with tarquin's ravishing strides towards his design
 moves like a ghost thou sure and firmset earth
 hear not my steps which way they walk for fear
 thy very stones prate of my whereabout
 and take the present horror from the time
 which now suits with it whiles i threat he lives
 words to the heat of deeds too cold breath gives
 a bell rings
 i go and it is done the bell invites me
 hear it not duncan for it is a knell
 that summons thee to heaven or to hell
 exit

act ii
scene ii the same
 enter lady macbeth
lady macbeth that which hath made them drunk hath made me bold
 what hath quench'd them hath given me fire
 hark peace
 it was the owl that shriek'd the fatal bellman
 which gives the stern'st goodnight he is about it
 the doors are open and the surfeited grooms
 do mock their charge with snores i have drugg'd
 their possets
