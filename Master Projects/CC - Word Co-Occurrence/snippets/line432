 the nimble spirits in the arteries
 as motion and longduring action tires
 the sinewy vigour of the traveller
 now for not looking on a woman's face
 you have in that forsworn the use of eyes
 and study too the causer of your vow
 for where is any author in the world
 teaches such beauty as a woman's eye
 learning is but an adjunct to ourself
 and where we are our learning likewise is
 then when ourselves we see in ladies eyes
 do we not likewise see our learning there
 o we have made a vow to study lords
 and in that vow we have forsworn our books
 for when would you my liege or you or you
 in leaden contemplation have found out
 such fiery numbers as the prompting eyes
 of beauty's tutors have enrich'd you with
 other slow arts entirely keep the brain
 and therefore finding barren practisers
 scarce show a harvest of their heavy toil
 but love first learned in a lady's eyes
 lives not alone immured in the brain
 but with the motion of all elements
 courses as swift as thought in every power
 and gives to every power a double power
 above their functions and their offices
 it adds a precious seeing to the eye
 a lover's eyes will gaze an eagle blind
 a lover's ear will hear the lowest sound
 when the suspicious head of theft is stopp'd
 love's feeling is more soft and sensible
 than are the tender horns of cockl'd snails
 love's tongue proves dainty bacchus gross in taste
 for valour is not love a hercules
 still climbing trees in the hesperides
 subtle as sphinx as sweet and musical
 as bright apollo's lute strung with his hair
 and when love speaks the voice of all the gods
 makes heaven drowsy with the harmony
 never durst poet touch a pen to write
 until his ink were temper'd with love's sighs
 o then his lines would ravish savage ears
 and plant in tyrants mild humility
 from women's eyes this doctrine i derive
 they sparkle still the right promethean fire
 they are the books the arts the academes
 that show contain and nourish all the world
 else none at all in ought proves excellent
 then fools you were these women to forswear
 or keeping what is sworn you will prove fools
 for wisdom's sake a word that all men love
 or for love's sake a word that loves all men
 or for men's sake the authors of these women
 or women's sake by whom we men are men
 let us once lose our oaths to find ourselves
 or else we lose ourselves to keep our oaths
 it is religion to be thus forsworn
 for charity itself fulfills the law
 and who can sever love from charity
ferdinand saint cupid then and soldiers to the field
biron advance your standards and upon them lords
 pellmell down with them but be first advised
 in conflict that you get the sun of them
longaville now to plaindealing lay these glozes by
 shall we resolve to woo these girls of france
ferdinand and win them too therefore let us devise
 some entertainment for them in their tents
biron first from the park let us conduct them thither
 then homeward every man attach the hand
 of his fair mistress in the afternoon
 we will with some strange pastime solace them
 such as the shortness of the time can shape
 for revels dances masks and merry hours
 forerun fair love strewing her way with flowers
ferdinand away away no time shall be omitted
 that will betime and may by us be fitted
biron allons allons sow'd cockle reap'd no corn
 and justice always whirls in equal measure
 light wenches may prove plagues to men forsworn
 if so our copper buys no better treasure
