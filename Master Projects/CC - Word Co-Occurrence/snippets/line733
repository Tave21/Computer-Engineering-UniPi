 call for our chiefest men of discipline
 to cull the plots of best advantages
 we'll lay before this town our royal bones
 wade to the marketplace in frenchmen's blood
 but we will make it subject to this boy
constance stay for an answer to your embassy
 lest unadvised you stain your swords with blood
 my lord chatillon may from england bring
 that right in peace which here we urge in war
 and then we shall repent each drop of blood
 that hot rash haste so indirectly shed
 enter chatillon
king philip a wonder lady lo upon thy wish
 our messenger chatillon is arrived
 what england says say briefly gentle lord
 we coldly pause for thee chatillon speak
chatillon then turn your forces from this paltry siege
 and stir them up against a mightier task
 england impatient of your just demands
 hath put himself in arms the adverse winds
 whose leisure i have stay'd have given him time
 to land his legions all as soon as i
 his marches are expedient to this town
 his forces strong his soldiers confident
 with him along is come the motherqueen
 an ate stirring him to blood and strife
 with her her niece the lady blanch of spain
 with them a bastard of the king's deceased
 and all the unsettled humours of the land
 rash inconsiderate fiery voluntaries
 with ladies faces and fierce dragons spleens
 have sold their fortunes at their native homes
 bearing their birthrights proudly on their backs
 to make hazard of new fortunes here
 in brief a braver choice of dauntless spirits
 than now the english bottoms have waft o'er
 did nearer float upon the swelling tide
 to do offence and scath in christendom
 drum beats
 the interruption of their churlish drums
 cuts off more circumstance they are at hand
 to parley or to fight therefore prepare
king philip how much unlook'd for is this expedition
austria by how much unexpected by so much
 we must awake endavour for defence
 for courage mounteth with occasion
 let them be welcome then we are prepared
 enter king john queen elinor blanch the bastard
 lords and forces
king john peace be to france if france in peace permit
 our just and lineal entrance to our own
 if not bleed france and peace ascend to heaven
 whiles we god's wrathful agent do correct
 their proud contempt that beats his peace to heaven
king philip peace be to england if that war return
 from france to england there to live in peace
 england we love and for that england's sake
 with burden of our armour here we sweat
 this toil of ours should be a work of thine
 but thou from loving england art so far
 that thou hast underwrought his lawful king
 cut off the sequence of posterity
 outfaced infant state and done a rape
 upon the maiden virtue of the crown
 look here upon thy brother geffrey's face
 these eyes these brows were moulded out of his
 this little abstract doth contain that large
 which died in geffrey and the hand of time
 shall draw this brief into as huge a volume
 that geffrey was thy elder brother born
 and this his son england was geffrey's right
 and this is geffrey's in the name of god
 how comes it then that thou art call'd a king
 when living blood doth in these temples beat
 which owe the crown that thou o'ermasterest
king john from whom hast thou this great commission france
 to draw my answer from thy articles
king philip from that supernal judge that stirs good thoughts
 in any breast of strong authority
 to look into the blots and stains of right
 that judge hath made me guardian to this boy
 under whose warrant i impeach thy wrong
 and by whose help i mean to chastise it
king john alack thou dost usurp authority
king philip excuse it is to beat usurping down
queen elinor who is it thou dost call usurper france
constance let me make answer thy usurping son
queen elinor out insolent thy bastard shall be king
 that thou mayst be a queen and cheque the world
constance my bed was ever to thy son as true
 as thine was to thy husband and this boy
 liker in feature to his father geffrey
 than thou and john in manners being as like
 as rain to water or devil to his dam
 my boy a bastard by my soul i think
 his father never was so true begot
 it cannot be an if thou wert his mother
queen elinor there's a good mother boy that blots thy father
constance there's a good grandam boy that would blot thee
austria peace
bastard hear the crier
austria what the devil art thou
bastard one that will play the devil sir with you
 an a may catch your hide and you alone
 you are the hare of whom the proverb goes
 whose valour plucks dead lions by the beard
 i'll smoke your skincoat an i catch you right
 sirrah look to't i faith i will i faith
blanch o well did he become that lion's robe
 that did disrobe the lion of that robe
bastard it lies as sightly on the back of him
 as great alcides shows upon an ass
 but ass i'll take that burthen from your back
 or lay on that shall make your shoulders crack
austria what craker is this same that deafs our ears
 with this abundance of superfluous breath
king philip lewis determine what we shall do straight
lewis women and fools break off your conference
 king john this is the very sum of all
 england and ireland anjou touraine maine
 in right of arthur do i claim of thee
 wilt thou resign them and lay down thy arms
king john my life as soon i do defy thee france
 arthur of bretagne yield thee to my hand
 and out of my dear love i'll give thee more
 than e'er the coward hand of france can win
 submit thee boy
queen elinor come to thy grandam child
constance do child go to it grandam child
 give grandam kingdom and it grandam will
 give it a plum a cherry and a fig
 there's a good grandam
arthur good my mother peace
 i would that i were low laid in my grave
 i am not worth this coil that's made for me
queen elinor his mother shames him so poor boy he weeps
constance now shame upon you whether she does or no
 his grandam's wrongs and not his mother's shames
 draws those heavenmoving pearls from his poor eyes
 which heaven shall take in nature of a fee
 ay with these crystal beads heaven shall be bribed
 to do him justice and revenge on you
queen elinor thou monstrous slanderer of heaven and earth
constance thou monstrous injurer of heaven and earth
 call not me slanderer thou and thine usurp
 the dominations royalties and rights
 of this oppressed boy this is thy eld'st son's son
 infortunate in nothing but in thee
 thy sins are visited in this poor child
 the canon of the law is laid on him
 being but the second generation
 removed from thy sinconceiving womb
king john bedlam have done
constance i have but this to say
 that he is not only plagued for her sin
 but god hath made her sin and her the plague
 on this removed issue plague for her
 and with her plague her sin his injury
 her injury the beadle to her sin
 all punish'd in the person of this child
 and all for her a plague upon her
queen elinor thou unadvised scold i can produce
 a will that bars the title of thy son
constance ay who doubts that a will a wicked will
 a woman's will a canker'd grandam's will
king philip peace lady pause or be more temperate
 it ill beseems this presence to cry aim
 to these illtuned repetitions
 some trumpet summon hither to the walls
 these men of angiers let us hear them speak
 whose title they admit arthur's or john's
 trumpet sounds enter certain citizens upon the walls
first citizen who is it that hath warn'd us to the walls
king philip tis france for england
king john england for itself
 you men of angiers and my loving subjects
king philip you loving men of angiers arthur's subjects
 our trumpet call'd you to this gentle parle
king john for our advantage therefore hear us first
 these flags of france that are advanced here
 before the eye and prospect of your town
 have hither march'd to your endamagement
 the cannons have their bowels full of wrath
 and ready mounted are they to spit forth
 their iron indignation gainst your walls
 all preparation for a bloody siege
 all merciless proceeding by these french
 confronts your city's eyes your winking gates
 and but for our approach those sleeping stones
 that as a waist doth girdle you about
 by the compulsion of their ordinance
 by this time from their fixed beds of lime
 had been dishabited and wide havoc made
 for bloody power to rush upon your peace
 but on the sight of us your lawful king
 who painfully with much expedient march
 have brought a countercheque before your gates
 to save unscratch'd your city's threatened cheeks
 behold the french amazed vouchsafe a parle
 and now instead of bullets wrapp'd in fire
