cornwall i will have my revenge ere i depart his house
edmund how my lord i may be censured that nature thus
 gives way to loyalty something fears me to think
 of
cornwall i now perceive it was not altogether your
 brother's evil disposition made him seek his death
 but a provoking merit set awork by a reprovable
 badness in himself
edmund how malicious is my fortune that i must repent to
 be just this is the letter he spoke of which
 approves him an intelligent party to the advantages
 of france o heavens that this treason were not
 or not i the detector
cornwall o with me to the duchess
edmund if the matter of this paper be certain you have
 mighty business in hand
cornwall true or false it hath made thee earl of
 gloucester seek out where thy father is that he
 may be ready for our apprehension
edmund aside if i find him comforting the king it will
 stuff his suspicion more fullyi will persevere in
 my course of loyalty though the conflict be sore
 between that and my blood
cornwall i will lay trust upon thee and thou shalt find a
 dearer father in my love

edgar when we our betters see bearing our woes
 we scarcely think our miseries our foes
 who alone suffers suffers most i the mind
 leaving free things and happy shows behind
 but then the mind much sufferance doth o'er skip
 when grief hath mates and bearing fellowship
 how light and portable my pain seems now
 when that which makes me bend makes the king bow
 he childed as i father'd tom away
 mark the high noises and thyself bewray
 when false opinion whose wrong thought defiles thee
 in thy just proof repeals and reconciles thee
 what will hap more tonight safe scape the king
