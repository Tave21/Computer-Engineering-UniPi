 horses against the which he has imponed as i take
 it six french rapiers and poniards with their
 assigns as girdle hangers and so three of the
 carriages in faith are very dear to fancy very
 responsive to the hilts most delicate carriages
 and of very liberal conceit
hamlet what call you the carriages
horatio i knew you must be edified by the margent ere you had done
osric the carriages sir are the hangers
hamlet the phrase would be more german to the matter if we
 could carry cannon by our sides i would it might
 be hangers till then but on six barbary horses
 against six french swords their assigns and three
 liberalconceited carriages that's the french bet
 against the danish why is this imponed as you call it
osric the king sir hath laid that in a dozen passes
 between yourself and him he shall not exceed you
 three hits he hath laid on twelve for nine and it
 would come to immediate trial if your lordship
 would vouchsafe the answer
hamlet how if i answer no'
osric i mean my lord the opposition of your person in trial
hamlet sir i will walk here in the hall if it please his
 majesty tis the breathing time of day with me let
 the foils be brought the gentleman willing and the
 king hold his purpose i will win for him an i can
 if not i will gain nothing but my shame and the odd hits
osric shall i redeliver you e'en so
hamlet to this effect sir after what flourish your nature will
osric i commend my duty to your lordship
hamlet yours yours
 exit osric
 he does well to commend it himself there are no
 tongues else for's turn
horatio this lapwing runs away with the shell on his head
hamlet he did comply with his dug before he sucked it
 thus has heand many more of the same bevy that i
 know the dressy age dotes ononly got the tune of
 the time and outward habit of encounter a kind of
 yesty collection which carries them through and
 through the most fond and winnowed opinions and do
 but blow them to their trial the bubbles are out
 enter a lord
lord my lord his majesty commended him to you by young
 osric who brings back to him that you attend him in
 the hall he sends to know if your pleasure hold to
 play with laertes or that you will take longer time
hamlet i am constant to my purpose they follow the king's
 pleasure if his fitness speaks mine is ready now
 or whensoever provided i be so able as now
lord the king and queen and all are coming down
hamlet in happy time
lord the queen desires you to use some gentle
 entertainment to laertes before you fall to play
hamlet she well instructs me
 exit lord
horatio you will lose this wager my lord
hamlet i do not think so since he went into france i
 have been in continual practise i shall win at the
 odds but thou wouldst not think how ill all's here
 about my heart but it is no matter
horatio nay good my lord
hamlet it is but foolery but it is such a kind of
 gaingiving as would perhaps trouble a woman
horatio if your mind dislike any thing obey it i will
 forestall their repair hither and say you are not
 fit
hamlet not a whit we defy augury there's a special
 providence in the fall of a sparrow if it be now
 tis not to come if it be not to come it will be
 now if it be not now yet it will come the
 readiness is all since no man has aught of what he
 leaves what is't to leave betimes
 enter king claudius queen gertrude laertes
 lords osric and attendants with foils &c
king claudius come hamlet come and take this hand from me
 king claudius puts laertes hand into hamlet's
hamlet give me your pardon sir i've done you wrong
 but pardon't as you are a gentleman
 this presence knows
 and you must needs have heard how i am punish'd
 with sore distraction what i have done
 that might your nature honour and exception
 roughly awake i here proclaim was madness
 was't hamlet wrong'd laertes never hamlet
 if hamlet from himself be ta'en away
 and when he's not himself does wrong laertes
 then hamlet does it not hamlet denies it
 who does it then his madness if't be so
 hamlet is of the faction that is wrong'd
 his madness is poor hamlet's enemy
 sir in this audience
 let my disclaiming from a purposed evil
 free me so far in your most generous thoughts
 that i have shot mine arrow o'er the house
 and hurt my brother
laertes i am satisfied in nature
 whose motive in this case should stir me most
 to my revenge but in my terms of honour
 i stand aloof and will no reconcilement
 till by some elder masters of known honour
 i have a voice and precedent of peace
 to keep my name ungored but till that time
 i do receive your offer'd love like love
 and will not wrong it
hamlet i embrace it freely
 and will this brother's wager frankly play
 give us the foils come on
laertes come one for me
hamlet i'll be your foil laertes in mine ignorance
 your skill shall like a star i the darkest night
 stick fiery off indeed
laertes you mock me sir
hamlet no by this hand
king claudius give them the foils young osric cousin hamlet
 you know the wager
hamlet very well my lord
 your grace hath laid the odds o the weaker side
king claudius i do not fear it i have seen you both
 but since he is better'd we have therefore odds
laertes this is too heavy let me see another
hamlet this likes me well these foils have all a length
 they prepare to play
osric ay my good lord
king claudius set me the stoops of wine upon that table
 if hamlet give the first or second hit
 or quit in answer of the third exchange
 let all the battlements their ordnance fire
 the king shall drink to hamlet's better breath
 and in the cup an union shall he throw
 richer than that which four successive kings
 in denmark's crown have worn give me the cups
 and let the kettle to the trumpet speak
 the trumpet to the cannoneer without
 the cannons to the heavens the heavens to earth
 now the king dunks to hamlet come begin
 and you the judges bear a wary eye
hamlet come on sir
laertes come my lord
 they play
hamlet one
laertes no
hamlet judgment
osric a hit a very palpable hit
laertes well again
king claudius stay give me drink hamlet this pearl is thine
 here's to thy health
 trumpets sound and cannon shot off within
 give him the cup
hamlet i'll play this bout first set it by awhile come
 they play
 another hit what say you
laertes a touch a touch i do confess
king claudius our son shall win
queen gertrude he's fat and scant of breath
 here hamlet take my napkin rub thy brows
 the queen carouses to thy fortune hamlet
hamlet good madam
king claudius gertrude do not drink
queen gertrude i will my lord i pray you pardon me
king claudius aside it is the poison'd cup it is too late
hamlet i dare not drink yet madam by and by
queen gertrude come let me wipe thy face
laertes my lord i'll hit him now
king claudius i do not think't
laertes aside and yet tis almost gainst my conscience
hamlet come for the third laertes you but dally
 i pray you pass with your best violence
 i am afeard you make a wanton of me
laertes say you so come on
 they play
osric nothing neither way
laertes have at you now
 laertes wounds hamlet then in scuffling they
 change rapiers and hamlet wounds laertes
king claudius part them they are incensed
hamlet nay come again
 queen gertrude falls
osric look to the queen there ho
horatio they bleed on both sides how is it my lord
osric how is't laertes
laertes why as a woodcock to mine own springe osric
 i am justly kill'd with mine own treachery
hamlet how does the queen
king claudius she swounds to see them bleed
queen gertrude no no the drink the drinko my dear hamlet
 the drink the drink i am poison'd
 dies
hamlet o villany ho let the door be lock'd
 treachery seek it out
laertes it is here hamlet hamlet thou art slain
 no medicine in the world can do thee good
 in thee there is not half an hour of life
 the treacherous instrument is in thy hand
 unbated and envenom'd the foul practise
 hath turn'd itself on me lo here i lie
 never to rise again thy mother's poison'd
 i can no more the king the king's to blame
hamlet the pointenvenom'd too
 then venom to thy work
