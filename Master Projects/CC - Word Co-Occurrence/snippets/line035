and they said unto him ask counsel we pray thee of god that we may know whether our way which we go shall be prosperous
and the priest said unto them go in peace before the lord is your way wherein ye go
then the five men departed and came to laish and saw the people that were therein how they dwelt careless after the manner of the zidonians quiet and secure and there was no magistrate in the land that might put them to shame in any thing and they were far from the zidonians and had no business with any man
and they came unto their brethren to zorah and eshtaol and their brethren said unto them what say ye
and they said arise that we may go up against them for we have seen the land and behold it is very good and are ye still be not slothful to go and to enter to possess the land
when ye go ye shall come unto a people secure and to a large land for god hath given it into your hands a place where there is no want of any thing that is in the earth
and there went from thence of the family of the danites out of zorah and out of eshtaol six hundred men appointed with weapons of war
and they went up and pitched in kirjathjearim in judah wherefore they called that place mahanehdan unto this day behold it is behind kirjathjearim
and they passed thence unto mount ephraim and came unto the house of micah
then answered the five men that went to spy out the country of laish and said unto their brethren do ye know that there is in these houses an ephod and teraphim and a graven image and a molten image now therefore consider what ye have to do
and they turned thitherward and came to the house of the young man the levite even unto the house of micah and saluted him
and the six hundred men appointed with their weapons of war which were of the children of dan stood by the entering of the gate
and the five men that went to spy out the land went up and came in thither and took the graven image and the ephod and the teraphim and the molten image and the priest stood in the entering of the gate with the six hundred men that were appointed with weapons of war
and these went into micah's house and fetched the carved image the ephod and the teraphim and the molten image then said the priest unto them what do ye
and they said unto him hold thy peace lay thine hand upon thy mouth and go with us and be to us a father and a priest is it better for thee to be a priest unto the house of one man or that thou be a priest unto a tribe and a family in israel
and the priest's heart was glad and he took the ephod and the teraphim and the graven image and went in the midst of the people
so they turned and departed and put the little ones and the cattle and the carriage before them
and when they were a good way from the house of micah the men that were in the houses near to micah's house were gathered together and overtook the children of dan
and they cried unto the children of dan and they turned their faces and said unto micah what aileth thee that thou comest with such a company
and he said ye have taken away my gods which i made and the priest and ye are gone away and what have i more and what is this that ye say unto me what aileth thee
and the children of dan said unto him let not thy voice be heard among us lest angry fellows run upon thee and thou lose thy life with the lives of thy household
and the children of dan went their way and when micah saw that they were too strong for him he turned and went back unto his house
and they took the things which micah had made and the priest which he had and came unto laish unto a people that were at quiet and secure and they smote them with the edge of the sword and burnt the city with fire
and there was no deliverer because it was far from zidon and they had no business with any man and it was in the valley that lieth by bethrehob and they built a city and dwelt therein
and they called the name of the city dan after the name of dan their father who was born unto israel howbeit the name of the city was laish at the first
and the children of dan set up the graven image and jonathan the son of gershom the son of manasseh he and his sons were priests to the tribe of dan until the day of the captivity of the land
and they set them up micah's graven image which he made all the time that the house of god was in shiloh
and it came to pass in those days when there was no king in israel that there was a certain levite sojourning on the side of mount ephraim who took to him a concubine out of bethlehemjudah
and his concubine played the whore against him and went away from him unto her father's house to bethlehemjudah and was there four whole months
and her husband arose and went after her to speak friendly unto her and to bring her again having his servant with him and a couple of asses and she brought him into her father's house and when the father of the damsel saw him he rejoiced to meet him
and his father in law the damsel's father retained him and he abode with him three days so they did eat and drink and lodged there
and it came to pass on the fourth day when they arose early in the morning that he rose up to depart and the damsel's father said unto his son in law comfort thine heart with a morsel of bread and afterward go your way
and they sat down and did eat and drink both of them together for the damsel's father had said unto the man be content i pray thee and tarry all night and let thine heart be merry
and when the man rose up to depart his father in law urged him therefore he lodged there again
and he arose early in the morning on the fifth day to depart and the damsel's father said comfort thine heart i pray thee and they tarried until afternoon and they did eat both of them
and when the man rose up to depart he and his concubine and his servant his father in law the damsel's father said unto him behold now the day draweth toward evening i pray you tarry all night behold the day groweth to an end lodge here that thine heart may be merry and to morrow get you early on your way that thou mayest go home
but the man would not tarry that night but he rose up and departed and came over against jebus which is jerusalem and there were with him two asses saddled his concubine also was with him
and when they were by jebus the day was far spent and the servant said unto his master come i pray thee and let us turn in into this city of the jebusites and lodge in it
and his master said unto him we will not turn aside hither into the city of a stranger that is not of the children of israel we will pass over to gibeah
and he said unto his servant come and let us draw near to one of these places to lodge all night in gibeah or in ramah
and they passed on and went their way and the sun went down upon them when they were by gibeah which belongeth to benjamin
and they turned aside thither to go in and to lodge in gibeah and when he went in he sat him down in a street of the city for there was no man that took them into his house to lodging
and behold there came an old man from his work out of the field at even which was also of mount ephraim and he sojourned in gibeah but the men of the place were benjamites
and when he had lifted up his eyes he saw a wayfaring man in the street of the city and the old man said whither goest thou and whence comest thou
and he said unto him we are passing from bethlehemjudah toward the side of mount ephraim from thence am i and i went to bethlehemjudah but i am now going to the house of the lord and there is no man that receiveth me to house
yet there is both straw and provender for our asses and there is bread and wine also for me and for thy handmaid and for the young man which is with thy servants there is no want of any thing
and the old man said peace be with thee howsoever let all thy wants lie upon me only lodge not in the street
so he brought him into his house and gave provender unto the asses and they washed their feet and did eat and drink
now as they were making their hearts merry behold the men of the city certain sons of belial beset the house round about and beat at the door and spake to the master of the house the old man saying bring forth the man that came into thine house that we may know him
and the man the master of the house went out unto them and said unto them nay my brethren nay i pray you do not so wickedly seeing that this man is come into mine house do not this folly
behold here is my daughter a maiden and his concubine them i will bring out now and humble ye them and do with them what seemeth good unto you but unto this man do not so vile a thing
but the men would not hearken to him so the man took his concubine and brought her forth unto them and they knew her and abused her all the night until the morning and when the day began to spring they let her go
then came the woman in the dawning of the day and fell down at the door of the man's house where her lord was till it was light
and her lord rose up in the morning and opened the doors of the house and went out to go his way and behold the woman his concubine was fallen down at the door of the house and her hands were upon the threshold
and he said unto her up and let us be going but none answered then the man took her up upon an ass and the man rose up and gat him unto his place
and when he was come into his house he took a knife and laid hold on his concubine and divided her together with her bones into twelve pieces and sent her into all the coasts of israel
and it was so that all that saw it said there was no such deed done nor seen from the day that the children of israel came up out of the land of egypt unto this day consider of it take advice and speak your minds
then all the children of israel went out and the congregation was gathered together as one man from dan even to beersheba with the land of gilead unto the lord in mizpeh
and the chief of all the people even of all the tribes of israel presented themselves in the assembly of the people of god four hundred thousand footmen that drew sword
now the children of benjamin heard that the children of israel were gone up to mizpeh then said the children of israel tell us how was this wickedness
and the levite the husband of the woman that was slain answered and said i came into gibeah that belongeth to benjamin i and my concubine to lodge
and the men of gibeah rose against me and beset the house round about upon me by night and thought to have slain me and my concubine have they forced that she is dead
and i took my concubine and cut her in pieces and sent her throughout all the country of the inheritance of israel for they have committed lewdness and folly in israel
behold ye are all children of israel give here your advice and counsel
and all the people arose as one man saying we will not any of us go to his tent neither will we any of us turn into his house
but now this shall be the thing which we will do to gibeah we will go up by lot against it
and we will take ten men of an hundred throughout all the tribes of israel and an hundred of a thousand and a thousand out of ten thousand to fetch victual for the people that they may do when they come to gibeah of benjamin according to all the folly that they have wrought in israel
so all the men of israel were gathered against the city knit together as one man
and the tribes of israel sent men through all the tribe of benjamin saying what wickedness is this that is done among you
now therefore deliver us the men the children of belial which are in gibeah that we may put them to death and put away evil from israel but the children of benjamin would not hearken to the voice of their brethren the children of israel
but the children of benjamin gathered themselves together out of the cities unto gibeah to go out to battle against the children of israel
and the children of benjamin were numbered at that time out of the cities twenty and six thousand men that drew sword beside the inhabitants of gibeah which were numbered seven hundred chosen men
among all this people there were seven hundred chosen men lefthanded every one could sling stones at an hair breadth and not miss
and the men of israel beside benjamin were numbered four hundred thousand men that drew sword all these were men of war
and the children of israel arose and went up to the house of god and asked counsel of god and said which of us shall go up first to the battle against the children of benjamin and the lord said judah shall go up first
and the children of israel rose up in the morning and encamped against gibeah
and the men of israel went out to battle against benjamin and the men of israel put themselves in array to fight against them at gibeah
and the children of benjamin came forth out of gibeah and destroyed down to the ground of the israelites that day twenty and two thousand men
and the people the men of israel encouraged themselves and set their battle again in array in the place where they put themselves in array the first day
and the children of israel went up and wept before the lord until even and asked counsel of the lord saying shall i go up again to battle against the children of benjamin my brother and the lord said go up against him
and the children of israel came near against the children of benjamin the second day
and benjamin went forth against them out of gibeah the second day and destroyed down to the ground of the children of israel again eighteen thousand men all these drew the sword
then all the children of israel and all the people went up and came unto the house of god and wept and sat there before the lord and fasted that day until even and offered burnt offerings and peace offerings before the lord
and the children of israel enquired of the lord for the ark of the covenant of god was there in those days
and phinehas the son of eleazar the son of aaron stood before it in those days saying shall i yet again go out to battle against the children of benjamin my brother or shall i cease and the lord said go up for to morrow i will deliver them into thine hand
and israel set liers in wait round about gibeah
and the children of israel went up against the children of benjamin on the third day and put themselves in array against gibeah as at other times
and the children of benjamin went out against the people and were drawn away from the city and they began to smite of the people and kill as at other times in the highways of which one goeth up to the house of god and the other to gibeah in the field about thirty men of israel
and the children of benjamin said they are smitten down before us as at the first but the children of israel said let us flee and draw them from the city unto the highways
and all the men of israel rose up out of their place and put themselves in array at baaltamar and the liers in wait of israel came forth out of their places even out of the meadows of gibeah
and there came against gibeah ten thousand chosen men out of all israel and the battle was sore but they knew not that evil was near them
and the lord smote benjamin before israel and the children of israel destroyed of the benjamites that day twenty and five thousand and an hundred men all these drew the sword
so the children of benjamin saw that they were smitten for the men of israel gave place to the benjamites because they trusted unto the liers in wait which they had set beside gibeah
and the liers in wait hasted and rushed upon gibeah and the liers in wait drew themselves along and smote all the city with the edge of the sword
now there was an appointed sign between the men of israel and the liers in wait that they should make a great flame with smoke rise up out of the city
and when the men of israel retired in the battle benjamin began to smite and kill of the men of israel about thirty persons for they said surely they are smitten down before us as in the first battle
but when the flame began to arise up out of the city with a pillar of smoke the benjamites looked behind them and behold the flame of the city ascended up to heaven
and when the men of israel turned again the men of benjamin were amazed for they saw that evil was come upon them
therefore they turned their backs before the men of israel unto the way of the wilderness but the battle overtook them and them which came out of the cities they destroyed in the midst of them
thus they inclosed the benjamites round about and chased them and trode them down with ease over against gibeah toward the sunrising
and there fell of benjamin eighteen thousand men all these were men of valour
and they turned and fled toward the wilderness unto the rock of rimmon and they gleaned of them in the highways five thousand men and pursued hard after them unto gidom and slew two thousand men of them
so that all which fell that day of benjamin were twenty and five thousand men that drew the sword all these were men of valour
but six hundred men turned and fled to the wilderness unto the rock rimmon and abode in the rock rimmon four months
and the men of israel turned again upon the children of benjamin and smote them with the edge of the sword as well the men of every city as the beast and all that came to hand also they set on fire all the cities that they came to
now the men of israel had sworn in mizpeh saying there shall not any of us give his daughter unto benjamin to wife
and the people came to the house of god and abode there till even before god and lifted up their voices and wept sore
and said o lord god of israel why is this come to pass in israel that there should be to day one tribe lacking in israel
and it came to pass on the morrow that the people rose early and built there an altar and offered burnt offerings and peace offerings
and the children of israel said who is there among all the tribes of israel that came not up with the congregation unto the lord for they had made a great oath concerning him that came not up to the lord to mizpeh saying he shall surely be put to death
and the children of israel repented them for benjamin their brother and said there is one tribe cut off from israel this day
how shall we do for wives for them that remain seeing we have sworn by the lord that we will not give them of our daughters to wives
and they said what one is there of the tribes of israel that came not up to mizpeh to the lord and behold there came none to the camp from jabeshgilead to the assembly
for the people were numbered and behold there were none of the inhabitants of jabeshgilead there
and the congregation sent thither twelve thousand men of the valiantest and commanded them saying go and smite the inhabitants of jabeshgilead with the edge of the sword with the women and the children
and this is the thing that ye shall do ye shall utterly destroy every male and every woman that hath lain by man
and they found among the inhabitants of jabeshgilead four hundred young virgins that had known no man by lying with any male and they brought them unto the camp to shiloh which is in the land of canaan
and the whole congregation sent some to speak to the children of benjamin that were in the rock rimmon and to call peaceably unto them
and benjamin came again at that time and they gave them wives which they had saved alive of the women of jabeshgilead and yet so they sufficed them not
and the people repented them for benjamin because that the lord had made a breach in the tribes of israel
then the elders of the congregation said how shall we do for wives for them that remain seeing the women are destroyed out of benjamin
and they said there must be an inheritance for them that be escaped of benjamin that a tribe be not destroyed out of israel
howbeit we may not give them wives of our daughters for the children of israel have sworn saying cursed be he that giveth a wife to benjamin
then they said behold there is a feast of the lord in shiloh yearly in a place which is on the north side of bethel on the east side of the highway that goeth up from bethel to shechem and on the south of lebonah
therefore they commanded the children of benjamin saying go and lie in wait in the vineyards
and see and behold if the daughters of shiloh come out to dance in dances then come ye out of the vineyards and catch you every man his wife of the daughters of shiloh and go to the land of benjamin
and it shall be when their fathers or their brethren come unto us to complain that we will say unto them be favourable unto them for our sakes because we reserved not to each man his wife in the war for ye did not give unto them at this time that ye should be guilty
and the children of benjamin did so and took them wives according to their number of them that danced whom they caught and they went and returned unto their inheritance and repaired the cities and dwelt in them
and the children of israel departed thence at that time every man to his tribe and to his family and they went out from thence every man to his inheritance
in those days there was no king in israel every man did that which was right in his own eyes
now it came to pass in the days when the judges ruled that there was a famine in the land and a certain man of bethlehemjudah went to sojourn in the country of moab he and his wife and his two sons
and the name of the man was elimelech and the name of his wife naomi and the name of his two sons mahlon and chilion ephrathites of bethlehemjudah and they came into the country of moab and continued there
and elimelech naomi's husband died and she was left and her two sons
and they took them wives of the women of moab the name of the one was orpah and the name of the other ruth and they dwelled there about ten years
and mahlon and chilion died also both of them and the woman was left of her two sons and her husband
then she arose with her daughters in law that she might return from the country of moab for she had heard in the country of moab how that the lord had visited his people in giving them bread
wherefore she went forth out of the place where she was and her two daughters in law with her and they went on the way to return unto the land of judah
and naomi said unto her two daughters in law go return each to her mother's house the lord deal kindly with you as ye have dealt with the dead and with me
the lord grant you that ye may find rest each of you in the house of her husband then she kissed them and they lifted up their voice and wept
and they said unto her surely we will return with thee unto thy people
and naomi said turn again my daughters why will ye go with me are there yet any more sons in my womb that they may be your husbands
turn again my daughters go your way for i am too old to have an husband if i should say i have hope if i should have an husband also to night and should also bear sons
would ye tarry for them till they were grown would ye stay for them from having husbands nay my daughters for it grieveth me much for your sakes that the hand of the lord is gone out against me
and they lifted up their voice and wept again and orpah kissed her mother in law but ruth clave unto her
and she said behold thy sister in law is gone back unto her people and unto her gods return thou after thy sister in law
and ruth said intreat me not to leave thee or to return from following after thee for whither thou goest i will go and where thou lodgest i will lodge thy people shall be my people and thy god my god
where thou diest will i die and there will i be buried the lord do so to me and more also if ought but death part thee and me
when she saw that she was stedfastly minded to go with her then she left speaking unto her
so they two went until they came to bethlehem and it came to pass when they were come to bethlehem that all the city was moved about them and they said is this naomi
and she said unto them call me not naomi call me mara for the almighty hath dealt very bitterly with me
i went out full and the lord hath brought me home again empty why then call ye me naomi seeing the lord hath testified against me and the almighty hath afflicted me
so naomi returned and ruth the moabitess her daughter in law with her which returned out of the country of moab and they came to bethlehem in the beginning of barley harvest
and naomi had a kinsman of her husband's a mighty man of wealth of the family of elimelech and his name was boaz
and ruth the moabitess said unto naomi let me now go to the field and glean ears of corn after him in whose sight i shall find grace and she said unto her go my daughter
and she went and came and gleaned in the field after the reapers and her hap was to light on a part of the field belonging unto boaz who was of the kindred of elimelech
and behold boaz came from bethlehem and said unto the reapers the lord be with you and they answered him the lord bless thee
then said boaz unto his servant that was set over the reapers whose damsel is this
and the servant that was set over the reapers answered and said it is the moabitish damsel that came back with naomi out of the country of moab
and she said i pray you let me glean and gather after the reapers among the sheaves so she came and hath continued even from the morning until now that she tarried a little in the house
then said boaz unto ruth hearest thou not my daughter go not to glean in another field neither go from hence but abide here fast by my maidens
let thine eyes be on the field that they do reap and go thou after them have i not charged the young men that they shall not touch thee and when thou art athirst go unto the vessels and drink of that which the young men have drawn
then she fell on her face and bowed herself to the ground and said unto him why have i found grace in thine eyes that thou shouldest take knowledge of me seeing i am a stranger
and boaz answered and said unto her it hath fully been shewed me all that thou hast done unto thy mother in law since the death of thine husband and how thou hast left thy father and thy mother and the land of thy nativity and art come unto a people which thou knewest not heretofore
the lord recompense thy work and a full reward be given thee of the lord god of israel under whose wings thou art come to trust
then she said let me find favour in thy sight my lord for that thou hast comforted me and for that thou hast spoken friendly unto thine handmaid though i be not like unto one of thine handmaidens
and boaz said unto her at mealtime come thou hither and eat of the bread and dip thy morsel in the vinegar and she sat beside the reapers and he reached her parched corn and she did eat and was sufficed and left
and when she was risen up to glean boaz commanded his young men saying let her glean even among the sheaves and reproach her not
and let fall also some of the handfuls of purpose for her and leave them that she may glean them and rebuke her not
so she gleaned in the field until even and beat out that she had gleaned and it was about an ephah of barley
and she took it up and went into the city and her mother in law saw what she had gleaned and she brought forth and gave to her that she had reserved after she was sufficed
and her mother in law said unto her where hast thou gleaned to day and where wroughtest thou blessed be he that did take knowledge of thee and she shewed her mother in law with whom she had wrought and said the man's name with whom i wrought to day is boaz
and naomi said unto her daughter in law blessed be he of the lord who hath not left off his kindness to the living and to the dead and naomi said unto her the man is near of kin unto us one of our next kinsmen
and ruth the moabitess said he said unto me also thou shalt keep fast by my young men until they have ended all my harvest
and naomi said unto ruth her daughter in law it is good my daughter that thou go out with his maidens that they meet thee not in any other field
so she kept fast by the maidens of boaz to glean unto the end of barley harvest and of wheat harvest and dwelt with her mother in law
then naomi her mother in law said unto her my daughter shall i not seek rest for thee that it may be well with thee
and now is not boaz of our kindred with whose maidens thou wast behold he winnoweth barley to night in the threshingfloor
wash thyself therefore and anoint thee and put thy raiment upon thee and get thee down to the floor but make not thyself known unto the man until he shall have done eating and drinking
and it shall be when he lieth down that thou shalt mark the place where he shall lie and thou shalt go in and uncover his feet and lay thee down and he will tell thee what thou shalt do
and she said unto her all that thou sayest unto me i will do
and she went down unto the floor and did according to all that her mother in law bade her
and when boaz had eaten and drunk and his heart was merry he went to lie down at the end of the heap of corn and she came softly and uncovered his feet and laid her down
and it came to pass at midnight that the man was afraid and turned himself and behold a woman lay at his feet
and he said who art thou and she answered i am ruth thine handmaid spread therefore thy skirt over thine handmaid for thou art a near kinsman
and he said blessed be thou of the lord my daughter for thou hast shewed more kindness in the latter end than at the beginning inasmuch as thou followedst not young men whether poor or rich
and now my daughter fear not i will do to thee all that thou requirest for all the city of my people doth know that thou art a virtuous woman
and now it is true that i am thy near kinsman howbeit there is a kinsman nearer than i
tarry this night and it shall be in the morning that if he will perform unto thee the part of a kinsman well let him do the kinsman's part but if he will not do the part of a kinsman to thee then will i do the part of a kinsman to thee as the lord liveth lie down until the morning
and she lay at his feet until the morning and she rose up before one could know another and he said let it not be known that a woman came into the floor
also he said bring the vail that thou hast upon thee and hold it and when she held it he measured six measures of barley and laid it on her and she went into the city
and when she came to her mother in law she said who art thou my daughter and she told her all that the man had done to her
and she said these six measures of barley gave he me for he said to me go not empty unto thy mother in law
then said she sit still my daughter until thou know how the matter will fall for the man will not be in rest until he have finished the thing this day
then went boaz up to the gate and sat him down there and behold the kinsman of whom boaz spake came by unto whom he said ho such a one turn aside sit down here and he turned aside and sat down
and he took ten men of the elders of the city and said sit ye down here and they sat down
and he said unto the kinsman naomi that is come again out of the country of moab selleth a parcel of land which was our brother elimelech's
and i thought to advertise thee saying buy it before the inhabitants and before the elders of my people if thou wilt redeem it redeem it but if thou wilt not redeem it then tell me that i may know for there is none to redeem it beside thee and i am after thee and he said i will redeem it
then said boaz what day thou buyest the field of the hand of naomi thou must buy it also of ruth the moabitess the wife of the dead to raise up the name of the dead upon his inheritance
and the kinsman said i cannot redeem it for myself lest i mar mine own inheritance redeem thou my right to thyself for i cannot redeem it
now this was the manner in former time in israel concerning redeeming and concerning changing for to confirm all things a man plucked off his shoe and gave it to his neighbour and this was a testimony in israel
