these wait all upon thee that thou mayest give them their meat in due season
that thou givest them they gather thou openest thine hand they are filled with good
thou hidest thy face they are troubled thou takest away their breath they die and return to their dust
thou sendest forth thy spirit they are created and thou renewest the face of the earth
the glory of the lord shall endure for ever the lord shall rejoice in his works
he looketh on the earth and it trembleth he toucheth the hills and they smoke
i will sing unto the lord as long as i live i will sing praise to my god while i have my being
my meditation of him shall be sweet i will be glad in the lord
let the sinners be consumed out of the earth and let the wicked be no more bless thou the lord o my soul praise ye the lord
o give thanks unto the lord call upon his name make known his deeds among the people
sing unto him sing psalms unto him talk ye of all his wondrous works
glory ye in his holy name let the heart of them rejoice that seek the lord
seek the lord and his strength seek his face evermore
remember his marvellous works that he hath done his wonders and the judgments of his mouth
o ye seed of abraham his servant ye children of jacob his chosen
he is the lord our god his judgments are in all the earth
he hath remembered his covenant for ever the word which he commanded to a thousand generations
which covenant he made with abraham and his oath unto isaac
and confirmed the same unto jacob for a law and to israel for an everlasting covenant
saying unto thee will i give the land of canaan the lot of your inheritance
when they were but a few men in number yea very few and strangers in it
when they went from one nation to another from one kingdom to another people
he suffered no man to do them wrong yea he reproved kings for their sakes
saying touch not mine anointed and do my prophets no harm
moreover he called for a famine upon the land he brake the whole staff of bread
he sent a man before them even joseph who was sold for a servant
whose feet they hurt with fetters he was laid in iron
until the time that his word came the word of the lord tried him
the king sent and loosed him even the ruler of the people and let him go free
he made him lord of his house and ruler of all his substance
to bind his princes at his pleasure and teach his senators wisdom
israel also came into egypt and jacob sojourned in the land of ham
and he increased his people greatly and made them stronger than their enemies
he turned their heart to hate his people to deal subtilly with his servants
he sent moses his servant and aaron whom he had chosen
they shewed his signs among them and wonders in the land of ham
he sent darkness and made it dark and they rebelled not against his word
he turned their waters into blood and slew their fish
their land brought forth frogs in abundance in the chambers of their kings
he spake and there came divers sorts of flies and lice in all their coasts
he gave them hail for rain and flaming fire in their land
he smote their vines also and their fig trees and brake the trees of their coasts
he spake and the locusts came and caterpillers and that without number
and did eat up all the herbs in their land and devoured the fruit of their ground
he smote also all the firstborn in their land the chief of all their strength
he brought them forth also with silver and gold and there was not one feeble person among their tribes
egypt was glad when they departed for the fear of them fell upon them
he spread a cloud for a covering and fire to give light in the night
the people asked and he brought quails and satisfied them with the bread of heaven
he opened the rock and the waters gushed out they ran in the dry places like a river
for he remembered his holy promise and abraham his servant
and he brought forth his people with joy and his chosen with gladness
and gave them the lands of the heathen and they inherited the labour of the people
that they might observe his statutes and keep his laws praise ye the lord
praise ye the lord o give thanks unto the lord for he is good for his mercy endureth for ever
who can utter the mighty acts of the lord who can shew forth all his praise
blessed are they that keep judgment and he that doeth righteousness at all times
remember me o lord with the favour that thou bearest unto thy people o visit me with thy salvation
that i may see the good of thy chosen that i may rejoice in the gladness of thy nation that i may glory with thine inheritance
we have sinned with our fathers we have committed iniquity we have done wickedly
our fathers understood not thy wonders in egypt they remembered not the multitude of thy mercies but provoked him at the sea even at the red sea
nevertheless he saved them for his name's sake that he might make his mighty power to be known
he rebuked the red sea also and it was dried up so he led them through the depths as through the wilderness
and he saved them from the hand of him that hated them and redeemed them from the hand of the enemy
and the waters covered their enemies there was not one of them left
then believed they his words they sang his praise
they soon forgat his works they waited not for his counsel
but lusted exceedingly in the wilderness and tempted god in the desert
and he gave them their request but sent leanness into their soul
they envied moses also in the camp and aaron the saint of the lord
the earth opened and swallowed up dathan and covered the company of abiram
and a fire was kindled in their company the flame burned up the wicked
they made a calf in horeb and worshipped the molten image
thus they changed their glory into the similitude of an ox that eateth grass
they forgat god their saviour which had done great things in egypt
wondrous works in the land of ham and terrible things by the red sea
therefore he said that he would destroy them had not moses his chosen stood before him in the breach to turn away his wrath lest he should destroy them
yea they despised the pleasant land they believed not his word
but murmured in their tents and hearkened not unto the voice of the lord
therefore he lifted up his hand against them to overthrow them in the wilderness
to overthrow their seed also among the nations and to scatter them in the lands
they joined themselves also unto baalpeor and ate the sacrifices of the dead
thus they provoked him to anger with their inventions and the plague brake in upon them
then stood up phinehas and executed judgment and so the plague was stayed
and that was counted unto him for righteousness unto all generations for evermore
they angered him also at the waters of strife so that it went ill with moses for their sakes
because they provoked his spirit so that he spake unadvisedly with his lips
they did not destroy the nations concerning whom the lord commanded them
but were mingled among the heathen and learned their works
and they served their idols which were a snare unto them
yea they sacrificed their sons and their daughters unto devils
and shed innocent blood even the blood of their sons and of their daughters whom they sacrificed unto the idols of canaan and the land was polluted with blood
thus were they defiled with their own works and went a whoring with their own inventions
therefore was the wrath of the lord kindled against his people insomuch that he abhorred his own inheritance
and he gave them into the hand of the heathen and they that hated them ruled over them
their enemies also oppressed them and they were brought into subjection under their hand
many times did he deliver them but they provoked him with their counsel and were brought low for their iniquity
nevertheless he regarded their affliction when he heard their cry
and he remembered for them his covenant and repented according to the multitude of his mercies
he made them also to be pitied of all those that carried them captives
save us o lord our god and gather us from among the heathen to give thanks unto thy holy name and to triumph in thy praise
blessed be the lord god of israel from everlasting to everlasting and let all the people say amen praise ye the lord
o give thanks unto the lord for he is good for his mercy endureth for ever
let the redeemed of the lord say so whom he hath redeemed from the hand of the enemy
and gathered them out of the lands from the east and from the west from the north and from the south
they wandered in the wilderness in a solitary way they found no city to dwell in
hungry and thirsty their soul fainted in them
then they cried unto the lord in their trouble and he delivered them out of their distresses
and he led them forth by the right way that they might go to a city of habitation
oh that men would praise the lord for his goodness and for his wonderful works to the children of men
for he satisfieth the longing soul and filleth the hungry soul with goodness
such as sit in darkness and in the shadow of death being bound in affliction and iron
because they rebelled against the words of god and contemned the counsel of the most high
therefore he brought down their heart with labour they fell down and there was none to help
then they cried unto the lord in their trouble and he saved them out of their distresses
he brought them out of darkness and the shadow of death and brake their bands in sunder
oh that men would praise the lord for his goodness and for his wonderful works to the children of men
for he hath broken the gates of brass and cut the bars of iron in sunder
fools because of their transgression and because of their iniquities are afflicted
their soul abhorreth all manner of meat and they draw near unto the gates of death
then they cry unto the lord in their trouble and he saveth them out of their distresses
he sent his word and healed them and delivered them from their destructions
oh that men would praise the lord for his goodness and for his wonderful works to the children of men
and let them sacrifice the sacrifices of thanksgiving and declare his works with rejoicing
they that go down to the sea in ships that do business in great waters
these see the works of the lord and his wonders in the deep
for he commandeth and raiseth the stormy wind which lifteth up the waves thereof
they mount up to the heaven they go down again to the depths their soul is melted because of trouble
they reel to and fro and stagger like a drunken man and are at their wit's end
then they cry unto the lord in their trouble and he bringeth them out of their distresses
he maketh the storm a calm so that the waves thereof are still
then are they glad because they be quiet so he bringeth them unto their desired haven
oh that men would praise the lord for his goodness and for his wonderful works to the children of men
let them exalt him also in the congregation of the people and praise him in the assembly of the elders
he turneth rivers into a wilderness and the watersprings into dry ground
a fruitful land into barrenness for the wickedness of them that dwell therein
he turneth the wilderness into a standing water and dry ground into watersprings
and there he maketh the hungry to dwell that they may prepare a city for habitation
and sow the fields and plant vineyards which may yield fruits of increase
he blesseth them also so that they are multiplied greatly and suffereth not their cattle to decrease
again they are minished and brought low through oppression affliction and sorrow
he poureth contempt upon princes and causeth them to wander in the wilderness where there is no way
yet setteth he the poor on high from affliction and maketh him families like a flock
the righteous shall see it and rejoice and all iniquity shall stop her mouth
whoso is wise and will observe these things even they shall understand the lovingkindness of the lord
o god my heart is fixed i will sing and give praise even with my glory
awake psaltery and harp i myself will awake early
i will praise thee o lord among the people and i will sing praises unto thee among the nations
for thy mercy is great above the heavens and thy truth reacheth unto the clouds
be thou exalted o god above the heavens and thy glory above all the earth
that thy beloved may be delivered save with thy right hand and answer me
god hath spoken in his holiness i will rejoice i will divide shechem and mete out the valley of succoth
gilead is mine manasseh is mine ephraim also is the strength of mine head judah is my lawgiver
moab is my washpot over edom will i cast out my shoe over philistia will i triumph
who will bring me into the strong city who will lead me into edom
wilt not thou o god who hast cast us off and wilt not thou o god go forth with our hosts
give us help from trouble for vain is the help of man
through god we shall do valiantly for he it is that shall tread down our enemies
hold not thy peace o god of my praise
for the mouth of the wicked and the mouth of the deceitful are opened against me they have spoken against me with a lying tongue
they compassed me about also with words of hatred and fought against me without a cause
for my love they are my adversaries but i give myself unto prayer
and they have rewarded me evil for good and hatred for my love
set thou a wicked man over him and let satan stand at his right hand
when he shall be judged let him be condemned and let his prayer become sin
let his days be few and let another take his office
let his children be fatherless and his wife a widow
let his children be continually vagabonds and beg let them seek their bread also out of their desolate places
let the extortioner catch all that he hath and let the strangers spoil his labour
let there be none to extend mercy unto him neither let there be any to favour his fatherless children
let his posterity be cut off and in the generation following let their name be blotted out
let the iniquity of his fathers be remembered with the lord and let not the sin of his mother be blotted out
let them be before the lord continually that he may cut off the memory of them from the earth
because that he remembered not to shew mercy but persecuted the poor and needy man that he might even slay the broken in heart
as he loved cursing so let it come unto him as he delighted not in blessing so let it be far from him
as he clothed himself with cursing like as with his garment so let it come into his bowels like water and like oil into his bones
let it be unto him as the garment which covereth him and for a girdle wherewith he is girded continually
let this be the reward of mine adversaries from the lord and of them that speak evil against my soul
but do thou for me o god the lord for thy name's sake because thy mercy is good deliver thou me
for i am poor and needy and my heart is wounded within me
i am gone like the shadow when it declineth i am tossed up and down as the locust
my knees are weak through fasting and my flesh faileth of fatness
i became also a reproach unto them when they looked upon me they shaked their heads
help me o lord my god o save me according to thy mercy
that they may know that this is thy hand that thou lord hast done it
let them curse but bless thou when they arise let them be ashamed but let thy servant rejoice
let mine adversaries be clothed with shame and let them cover themselves with their own confusion as with a mantle
i will greatly praise the lord with my mouth yea i will praise him among the multitude
for he shall stand at the right hand of the poor to save him from those that condemn his soul
the lord said unto my lord sit thou at my right hand until i make thine enemies thy footstool
the lord shall send the rod of thy strength out of zion rule thou in the midst of thine enemies
thy people shall be willing in the day of thy power in the beauties of holiness from the womb of the morning thou hast the dew of thy youth
the lord hath sworn and will not repent thou art a priest for ever after the order of melchizedek
the lord at thy right hand shall strike through kings in the day of his wrath
he shall judge among the heathen he shall fill the places with the dead bodies he shall wound the heads over many countries
he shall drink of the brook in the way therefore shall he lift up the head
praise ye the lord i will praise the lord with my whole heart in the assembly of the upright and in the congregation
the works of the lord are great sought out of all them that have pleasure therein
his work is honourable and glorious and his righteousness endureth for ever
he hath made his wonderful works to be remembered the lord is gracious and full of compassion
