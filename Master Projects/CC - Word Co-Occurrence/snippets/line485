 you do their work and they shall have good luck
 are not you he
puck thou speak'st aright
 i am that merry wanderer of the night
 i jest to oberon and make him smile
 when i a fat and beanfed horse beguile
 neighing in likeness of a filly foal
 and sometime lurk i in a gossip's bowl
 in very likeness of a roasted crab
 and when she drinks against her lips i bob
 and on her wither'd dewlap pour the ale
 the wisest aunt telling the saddest tale
 sometime for threefoot stool mistaketh me
 then slip i from her bum down topples she
 and tailor cries and falls into a cough
 and then the whole quire hold their hips and laugh
 and waxen in their mirth and neeze and swear
 a merrier hour was never wasted there
 but room fairy here comes oberon
fairy and here my mistress would that he were gone
 enter from one side oberon with his train
 from the other titania with hers
oberon ill met by moonlight proud titania
titania what jealous oberon fairies skip hence
 i have forsworn his bed and company
oberon tarry rash wanton am not i thy lord
titania then i must be thy lady but i know
 when thou hast stolen away from fairy land
 and in the shape of corin sat all day
 playing on pipes of corn and versing love
 to amorous phillida why art thou here
 come from the farthest steppe of india
 but that forsooth the bouncing amazon
 your buskin'd mistress and your warrior love
 to theseus must be wedded and you come
 to give their bed joy and prosperity
oberon how canst thou thus for shame titania
 glance at my credit with hippolyta
 knowing i know thy love to theseus
 didst thou not lead him through the glimmering night
 from perigenia whom he ravished
 and make him with fair aegle break his faith
 with ariadne and antiopa
titania these are the forgeries of jealousy
 and never since the middle summer's spring
 met we on hill in dale forest or mead
 by paved fountain or by rushy brook
 or in the beached margent of the sea
 to dance our ringlets to the whistling wind
 but with thy brawls thou hast disturb'd our sport
 therefore the winds piping to us in vain
 as in revenge have suck'd up from the sea
 contagious fogs which falling in the land
 have every pelting river made so proud
 that they have overborne their continents
 the ox hath therefore stretch'd his yoke in vain
 the ploughman lost his sweat and the green corn
 hath rotted ere his youth attain'd a beard
 the fold stands empty in the drowned field
 and crows are fatted with the murrion flock
 the nine men's morris is fill'd up with mud
 and the quaint mazes in the wanton green
 for lack of tread are undistinguishable
 the human mortals want their winter here
 no night is now with hymn or carol blest
 therefore the moon the governess of floods
 pale in her anger washes all the air
 that rheumatic diseases do abound
 and thorough this distemperature we see
 the seasons alter hoaryheaded frosts
 far in the fresh lap of the crimson rose
 and on old hiems thin and icy crown
 an odorous chaplet of sweet summer buds
 is as in mockery set the spring the summer
 the childing autumn angry winter change
 their wonted liveries and the mazed world
 by their increase now knows not which is which
 and this same progeny of evils comes
 from our debate from our dissension
 we are their parents and original
oberon do you amend it then it lies in you
 why should titania cross her oberon
 i do but beg a little changeling boy
 to be my henchman
titania set your heart at rest
 the fairy land buys not the child of me
 his mother was a votaress of my order
 and in the spiced indian air by night
 full often hath she gossip'd by my side
 and sat with me on neptune's yellow sands
 marking the embarked traders on the flood
 when we have laugh'd to see the sails conceive
 and grow bigbellied with the wanton wind
 which she with pretty and with swimming gait
 followingher womb then rich with my young squire
 would imitate and sail upon the land
 to fetch me trifles and return again
 as from a voyage rich with merchandise
 but she being mortal of that boy did die
 and for her sake do i rear up her boy
 and for her sake i will not part with him
oberon how long within this wood intend you stay
titania perchance till after theseus weddingday
 if you will patiently dance in our round
 and see our moonlight revels go with us
 if not shun me and i will spare your haunts
oberon give me that boy and i will go with thee
titania not for thy fairy kingdom fairies away
 we shall chide downright if i longer stay
 exit titania with her train
oberon well go thy way thou shalt not from this grove
 till i torment thee for this injury
 my gentle puck come hither thou rememberest
 since once i sat upon a promontory
 and heard a mermaid on a dolphin's back
 uttering such dulcet and harmonious breath
 that the rude sea grew civil at her song
 and certain stars shot madly from their spheres
 to hear the seamaid's music
puck i remember
oberon that very time i saw but thou couldst not
 flying between the cold moon and the earth
 cupid all arm'd a certain aim he took
 at a fair vestal throned by the west
 and loosed his loveshaft smartly from his bow
 as it should pierce a hundred thousand hearts
 but i might see young cupid's fiery shaft
 quench'd in the chaste beams of the watery moon
 and the imperial votaress passed on
 in maiden meditation fancyfree
 yet mark'd i where the bolt of cupid fell
 it fell upon a little western flower
 before milkwhite now purple with love's wound
 and maidens call it loveinidleness
 fetch me that flower the herb i shew'd thee once
 the juice of it on sleeping eyelids laid
 will make or man or woman madly dote
 upon the next live creature that it sees
 fetch me this herb and be thou here again
 ere the leviathan can swim a league
puck i'll put a girdle round about the earth
 in forty minutes
 exit
oberon having once this juice
 i'll watch titania when she is asleep
 and drop the liquor of it in her eyes
 the next thing then she waking looks upon
 be it on lion bear or wolf or bull
 on meddling monkey or on busy ape
 she shall pursue it with the soul of love
 and ere i take this charm from off her sight
 as i can take it with another herb
 i'll make her render up her page to me
 but who comes here i am invisible
 and i will overhear their conference
 enter demetrius helena following him
demetrius i love thee not therefore pursue me not
 where is lysander and fair hermia
 the one i'll slay the other slayeth me
 thou told'st me they were stolen unto this wood
 and here am i and wode within this wood
 because i cannot meet my hermia
 hence get thee gone and follow me no more
helena you draw me you hardhearted adamant
 but yet you draw not iron for my heart
 is true as steel leave you your power to draw
 and i shall have no power to follow you
demetrius do i entice you do i speak you fair
 or rather do i not in plainest truth
 tell you i do not nor i cannot love you
helena and even for that do i love you the more
 i am your spaniel and demetrius
 the more you beat me i will fawn on you
 use me but as your spaniel spurn me strike me
 neglect me lose me only give me leave
 unworthy as i am to follow you
 what worser place can i beg in your love
 and yet a place of high respect with me
 than to be used as you use your dog
demetrius tempt not too much the hatred of my spirit
 for i am sick when i do look on thee
helena and i am sick when i look not on you
demetrius you do impeach your modesty too much
 to leave the city and commit yourself
 into the hands of one that loves you not
 to trust the opportunity of night
 and the ill counsel of a desert place
 with the rich worth of your virginity
helena your virtue is my privilege for that
 it is not night when i do see your face
 therefore i think i am not in the night
 nor doth this wood lack worlds of company
 for you in my respect are all the world
 then how can it be said i am alone
 when all the world is here to look on me
demetrius i'll run from thee and hide me in the brakes
 and leave thee to the mercy of wild beasts
helena the wildest hath not such a heart as you
 run when you will the story shall be changed
 apollo flies and daphne holds the chase
