that from the cold stone sparks of fire do fly
whereat a waxen torch forthwith he lighteth
which must be lodestar to his lustful eye
and to the flame thus speaks advisedly
'as from this cold flint i enforced this fire
so lucrece must i force to my desire'
here pale with fear he doth premeditate
the dangers of his loathsome enterprise
and in his inward mind he doth debate
what following sorrow may on this arise
then looking scornfully he doth despise
his naked armour of stillslaughter'd lust
and justly thus controls his thoughts unjust
'fair torch burn out thy light and lend it not
to darken her whose light excelleth thine
and die unhallow'd thoughts before you blot
with your uncleanness that which is divine
offer pure incense to so pure a shrine
let fair humanity abhor the deed
that spots and stains love's modest snowwhite weed
'o shame to knighthood and to shining arms
o foul dishonour to my household's grave
o impious act including all foul harms
a martial man to be soft fancy's slave
true valour still a true respect should have
then my digression is so vile so base
that it will live engraven in my face
'yea though i die the scandal will survive
and be an eyesore in my golden coat
some loathsome dash the herald will contrive
to cipher me how fondly i did dote
that my posterity shamed with the note
shall curse my bones and hold it for no sin
to wish that i their father had not bin
'what win i if i gain the thing i seek
a dream a breath a froth of fleeting joy
who buys a minute's mirth to wail a week
or sells eternity to get a toy
for one sweet grape who will the vine destroy
or what fond beggar but to touch the crown
would with the sceptre straight be strucken down
'if collatinus dream of my intent
will he not wake and in a desperate rage
post hither this vile purpose to prevent
this siege that hath engirt his marriage
this blur to youth this sorrow to the sage
this dying virtue this surviving shame
whose crime will bear an everduring blame
'o what excuse can my invention make
when thou shalt charge me with so black a deed
will not my tongue be mute my frail joints shake
mine eyes forego their light my false heart bleed
the guilt being great the fear doth still exceed
and extreme fear can neither fight nor fly
but cowardlike with trembling terror die
'had collatinus kill'd my son or sire
or lain in ambush to betray my life
or were he not my dear friend this desire
might have excuse to work upon his wife
as in revenge or quittal of such strife
but as he is my kinsman my dear friend
the shame and fault finds no excuse nor end
'shameful it is ay if the fact be known
hateful it is there is no hate in loving
i'll beg her love but she is own
the worst is but denial and reproving
my will is strong past reason's weak removing
who fears a sentence or an old man's saw
shall by a painted cloth be kept in awe'
thus graceless holds he disputation
'tween frozen conscience and hotburning will
and with good thoughts make dispensation
urging the worser sense for vantage still
which in a moment doth confound and kill
all pure effects and doth so far proceed
that what is vile shows like a virtuous deed
quoth he she took me kindly by the hand
and gazed for tidings in my eager eyes
fearing some hard news from the warlike band
where her beloved collatinus lies
o how her fear did make her colour rise
first red as roses that on lawn we lay
then white as lawn the roses took away
'and how her hand in my hand being lock'd
forced it to tremble with her loyal fear
which struck her sad and then it faster rock'd
until her husband's welfare she did hear
whereat she smiled with so sweet a cheer
that had narcissus seen her as she stood
selflove had never drown'd him in the flood
'why hunt i then for colour or excuses
all orators are dumb when beauty pleadeth
poor wretches have remorse in poor abuses
love thrives not in the heart that shadows dreadeth
affection is my captain and he leadeth
and when his gaudy banner is display'd
the coward fights and will not be dismay'd
'then childish fear avaunt debating die
respect and reason wait on wrinkled age
my heart shall never countermand mine eye
sad pause and deep regard beseem the sage
my part is youth and beats these from the stage
desire my pilot is beauty my prize
then who fears sinking where such treasure lies'
as corn o'ergrown by weeds so heedful fear
is almost choked by unresisted lust
away he steals with open listening ear
full of foul hope and full of fond mistrust
both which as servitors to the unjust
so cross him with their opposite persuasion
that now he vows a league and now invasion
within his thought her heavenly image sits
and in the selfsame seat sits collatine
that eye which looks on her confounds his wits
that eye which him beholds as more divine
unto a view so false will not incline
but with a pure appeal seeks to the heart
which once corrupted takes the worser part
and therein heartens up his servile powers
who flatter'd by their leader's jocund show
stuff up his lust as minutes fill up hours
and as their captain so their pride doth grow
paying more slavish tribute than they owe
by reprobate desire thus madly led
the roman lord marcheth to lucrece bed
the locks between her chamber and his will
each one by him enforced retires his ward
but as they open they all rate his ill
which drives the creeping thief to some regard
the threshold grates the door to have him heard
nightwandering weasels shriek to see him there
they fright him yet he still pursues his fear
as each unwilling portal yields him way
through little vents and crannies of the place
the wind wars with his torch to make him stay
and blows the smoke of it into his face
extinguishing his conduct in this case
but his hot heart which fond desire doth scorch
puffs forth another wind that fires the torch
and being lighted by the light he spies
lucretia's glove wherein her needle sticks
he takes it from the rushes where it lies
and griping it the needle his finger pricks
as who should say this glove to wanton tricks
is not inured return again in haste
thou see'st our mistress ornaments are chaste'
but all these poor forbiddings could not stay him
he in the worst sense construes their denial
the doors the wind the glove that did delay him
he takes for accidental things of trial
or as those bars which stop the hourly dial
who with a lingering slay his course doth let
till every minute pays the hour his debt
'so so quoth he these lets attend the time
like little frosts that sometime threat the spring
to add a more rejoicing to the prime
and give the sneaped birds more cause to sing
pain pays the income of each precious thing
huge rocks high winds strong pirates shelves and sands
the merchant fears ere rich at home he lands'
now is he come unto the chamberdoor
that shuts him from the heaven of his thought
which with a yielding latch and with no more
hath barr'd him from the blessed thing be sought
so from himself impiety hath wrought
that for his prey to pray he doth begin
as if the heavens should countenance his sin
but in the midst of his unfruitful prayer
having solicited th eternal power
that his foul thoughts might compass his fair fair
and they would stand auspicious to the hour
even there he starts quoth he i must deflower
the powers to whom i pray abhor this fact
how can they then assist me in the act
'then love and fortune be my gods my guide
my will is back'd with resolution
thoughts are but dreams till their effects be tried
the blackest sin is clear'd with absolution
against love's fire fear's frost hath dissolution
the eye of heaven is out and misty night
covers the shame that follows sweet delight'
this said his guilty hand pluck'd up the latch
and with his knee the door he opens wide
the dove sleeps fast that this nightowl will catch
thus treason works ere traitors be espied
who sees the lurking serpent steps aside
but she sound sleeping fearing no such thing
lies at the mercy of his mortal sting
into the chamber wickedly he stalks
and gazeth on her yet unstained bed
the curtains being close about he walks
rolling his greedy eyeballs in his head
by their high treason is his heart misled
which gives the watchword to his hand full soon
to draw the cloud that hides the silver moon
look as the fair and fierypointed sun
rushing from forth a cloud bereaves our sight
even so the curtain drawn his eyes begun
to wink being blinded with a greater light
whether it is that she reflects so bright
