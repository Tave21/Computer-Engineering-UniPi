 yet am i sworn and i did purpose boy
 with this same very iron to burn them out
arthur o now you look like hubert all this while
 you were disguised
hubert peace no more adieu
 your uncle must not know but you are dead
 i'll fill these dogged spies with false reports
 and pretty child sleep doubtless and secure
 that hubert for the wealth of all the world
 will not offend thee
arthur o heaven i thank you hubert
hubert silence no more go closely in with me
 much danger do i undergo for thee
 exeunt
 king john
act iv
scene ii king john's palace
 enter king john pembroke salisbury and other lords
king john here once again we sit once again crown'd
 and looked upon i hope with cheerful eyes
pembroke this once again but that your highness pleased
 was once superfluous you were crown'd before
 and that high royalty was ne'er pluck'd off
 the faiths of men ne'er stained with revolt
 fresh expectation troubled not the land
 with any long'dfor change or better state
salisbury therefore to be possess'd with double pomp
 to guard a title that was rich before
 to gild refined gold to paint the lily
 to throw a perfume on the violet
 to smooth the ice or add another hue
 unto the rainbow or with taperlight
 to seek the beauteous eye of heaven to garnish
 is wasteful and ridiculous excess
pembroke but that your royal pleasure must be done
 this act is as an ancient tale new told
 and in the last repeating troublesome
 being urged at a time unseasonable
salisbury in this the antique and well noted face
 of plain old form is much disfigured
 and like a shifted wind unto a sail
 it makes the course of thoughts to fetch about
 startles and frights consideration
 makes sound opinion sick and truth suspected
 for putting on so new a fashion'd robe
pembroke when workmen strive to do better than well
 they do confound their skill in covetousness
 and oftentimes excusing of a fault
 doth make the fault the worse by the excuse
 as patches set upon a little breach
 discredit more in hiding of the fault
 than did the fault before it was so patch'd
salisbury to this effect before you were new crown'd
 we breathed our counsel but it pleased your highness
 to overbear it and we are all well pleased
 since all and every part of what we would
 doth make a stand at what your highness will
king john some reasons of this double coronation
 i have possess'd you with and think them strong
 and more more strong then lesser is my fear
 i shall indue you with meantime but ask
 what you would have reform'd that is not well
 and well shall you perceive how willingly
 i will both hear and grant you your requests
pembroke then i as one that am the tongue of these
 to sound the purpose of all their hearts
 both for myself and them but chief of all
 your safety for the which myself and them
 bend their best studies heartily request
 the enfranchisement of arthur whose restraint
 doth move the murmuring lips of discontent
 to break into this dangerous argument
 if what in rest you have in right you hold
 why then your fears which as they say attend
 the steps of wrong should move you to mew up
 your tender kinsman and to choke his days
 with barbarous ignorance and deny his youth
 the rich advantage of good exercise
 that the time's enemies may not have this
 to grace occasions let it be our suit
 that you have bid us ask his liberty
 which for our goods we do no further ask
 than whereupon our weal on you depending
 counts it your weal he have his liberty
 enter hubert
king john let it be so i do commit his youth
 to your direction hubert what news with you
 taking him apart
pembroke this is the man should do the bloody deed
 he show'd his warrant to a friend of mine
 the image of a wicked heinous fault
 lives in his eye that close aspect of his
 does show the mood of a much troubled breast
 and i do fearfully believe tis done
 what we so fear'd he had a charge to do
salisbury the colour of the king doth come and go
 between his purpose and his conscience
 like heralds twixt two dreadful battles set
 his passion is so ripe it needs must break
pembroke and when it breaks i fear will issue thence
 the foul corruption of a sweet child's death
king john we cannot hold mortality's strong hand
 good lords although my will to give is living
 the suit which you demand is gone and dead
 he tells us arthur is deceased tonight
salisbury indeed we fear'd his sickness was past cure
pembroke indeed we heard how near his death he was
 before the child himself felt he was sick
 this must be answer'd either here or hence
king john why do you bend such solemn brows on me
 think you i bear the shears of destiny
 have i commandment on the pulse of life
salisbury it is apparent foul play and tis shame
 that greatness should so grossly offer it
 so thrive it in your game and so farewell
pembroke stay yet lord salisbury i'll go with thee
 and find the inheritance of this poor child
 his little kingdom of a forced grave
 that blood which owed the breadth of all this isle
 three foot of it doth hold bad world the while
 this must not be thus borne this will break out
 to all our sorrows and ere long i doubt
 exeunt lords
king john they burn in indignation i repent
 there is no sure foundation set on blood
 no certain life achieved by others death
 enter a messenger
 a fearful eye thou hast where is that blood
 that i have seen inhabit in those cheeks
 so foul a sky clears not without a storm
 pour down thy weather how goes all in france
messenger from france to england never such a power
 for any foreign preparation
 was levied in the body of a land
 the copy of your speed is learn'd by them
 for when you should be told they do prepare
 the tidings come that they are all arrived
king john o where hath our intelligence been drunk
 where hath it slept where is my mother's care
 that such an army could be drawn in france
 and she not hear of it
messenger my liege her ear
 is stopp'd with dust the first of april died
 your noble mother and as i hear my lord
 the lady constance in a frenzy died
 three days before but this from rumour's tongue
 i idly heard if true or false i know not
king john withhold thy speed dreadful occasion
 o make a league with me till i have pleased
 my discontented peers what mother dead
 how wildly then walks my estate in france
 under whose conduct came those powers of france
 that thou for truth givest out are landed here
messenger under the dauphin
king john thou hast made me giddy
 with these ill tidings
 enter the bastard and peter of pomfret
 now what says the world
 to your proceedings do not seek to stuff
 my head with more ill news for it is full
bastard but if you be afeard to hear the worst
 then let the worst unheard fall on your bead
king john bear with me cousin for i was amazed
 under the tide but now i breathe again
 aloft the flood and can give audience
 to any tongue speak it of what it will
bastard how i have sped among the clergymen
 the sums i have collected shall express
 but as i travell'd hither through the land
 i find the people strangely fantasied
 possess'd with rumours full of idle dreams
 not knowing what they fear but full of fear
 and here a prophet that i brought with me
 from forth the streets of pomfret whom i found
 with many hundreds treading on his heels
 to whom he sung in rude harshsounding rhymes
 that ere the next ascensionday at noon
 your highness should deliver up your crown
king john thou idle dreamer wherefore didst thou so
peter foreknowing that the truth will fall out so
king john hubert away with him imprison him
 and on that day at noon whereon he says
 i shall yield up my crown let him be hang'd
 deliver him to safety and return
 for i must use thee
 exeunt hubert with peter
 o my gentle cousin
 hear'st thou the news abroad who are arrived
bastard the french my lord men's mouths are full of it
 besides i met lord bigot and lord salisbury
 with eyes as red as newenkindled fire
 and others more going to seek the grave
 of arthur who they say is kill'd tonight
 on your suggestion
king john gentle kinsman go
 and thrust thyself into their companies
 i have a way to win their loves again
 bring them before me
bastard i will seek them out
king john nay but make haste the better foot before
