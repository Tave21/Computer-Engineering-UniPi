 romeo and juliet
act ii
 prologue
 enter chorus
chorus now old desire doth in his deathbed lie
 and young affection gapes to be his heir
 that fair for which love groan'd for and would die
 with tender juliet match'd is now not fair
 now romeo is beloved and loves again
 alike betwitched by the charm of looks
 but to his foe supposed he must complain
 and she steal love's sweet bait from fearful hooks
 being held a foe he may not have access
 to breathe such vows as lovers use to swear
 and she as much in love her means much less
 to meet her newbeloved any where
 but passion lends them power time means to meet
 tempering extremities with extreme sweet
 exit
 romeo and juliet
act ii
scene i a lane by the wall of capulet's orchard
 enter romeo
romeo can i go forward when my heart is here
 turn back dull earth and find thy centre out
 he climbs the wall and leaps down within it
 enter benvolio and mercutio
benvolio romeo my cousin romeo
mercutio he is wise
 and on my lie hath stol'n him home to bed
benvolio he ran this way and leap'd this orchard wall
 call good mercutio
mercutio nay i'll conjure too
 romeo humours madman passion lover
 appear thou in the likeness of a sigh
 speak but one rhyme and i am satisfied
 cry but ay me pronounce but love and dove'
 speak to my gossip venus one fair word
 one nickname for her purblind son and heir
 young adam cupid he that shot so trim
 when king cophetua loved the beggarmaid
 he heareth not he stirreth not he moveth not
 the ape is dead and i must conjure him
 i conjure thee by rosaline's bright eyes
 by her high forehead and her scarlet lip
 by her fine foot straight leg and quivering thigh
 and the demesnes that there adjacent lie
 that in thy likeness thou appear to us
benvolio and if he hear thee thou wilt anger him
mercutio this cannot anger him twould anger him
 to raise a spirit in his mistress circle
 of some strange nature letting it there stand
 till she had laid it and conjured it down
 that were some spite my invocation
 is fair and honest and in his mistress name
 i conjure only but to raise up him
benvolio come he hath hid himself among these trees
 to be consorted with the humorous night
 blind is his love and best befits the dark
mercutio if love be blind love cannot hit the mark
 now will he sit under a medlar tree
 and wish his mistress were that kind of fruit
 as maids call medlars when they laugh alone
 romeo that she were o that she were
 an open et caetera thou a poperin pear
 romeo good night i'll to my trucklebed
 this fieldbed is too cold for me to sleep
 come shall we go
benvolio go then for tis in vain
 to seek him here that means not to be found
 exeunt
 romeo and juliet
act ii
scene ii capulet's orchard
 enter romeo
romeo he jests at scars that never felt a wound
 juliet appears above at a window
 but soft what light through yonder window breaks
 it is the east and juliet is the sun
 arise fair sun and kill the envious moon
 who is already sick and pale with grief
 that thou her maid art far more fair than she
 be not her maid since she is envious
 her vestal livery is but sick and green
 and none but fools do wear it cast it off
 it is my lady o it is my love
 o that she knew she were
 she speaks yet she says nothing what of that
 her eye discourses i will answer it
 i am too bold tis not to me she speaks
 two of the fairest stars in all the heaven
 having some business do entreat her eyes
 to twinkle in their spheres till they return
 what if her eyes were there they in her head
 the brightness of her cheek would shame those stars
 as daylight doth a lamp her eyes in heaven
 would through the airy region stream so bright
 that birds would sing and think it were not night
 see how she leans her cheek upon her hand
 o that i were a glove upon that hand
 that i might touch that cheek
juliet ay me
romeo she speaks
 o speak again bright angel for thou art
 as glorious to this night being o'er my head
 as is a winged messenger of heaven
 unto the whiteupturned wondering eyes
 of mortals that fall back to gaze on him
 when he bestrides the lazypacing clouds
 and sails upon the bosom of the air
juliet o romeo romeo wherefore art thou romeo
 deny thy father and refuse thy name
 or if thou wilt not be but sworn my love
 and i'll no longer be a capulet
romeo aside shall i hear more or shall i speak at this
juliet tis but thy name that is my enemy
 thou art thyself though not a montague
 what's montague it is nor hand nor foot
 nor arm nor face nor any other part
 belonging to a man o be some other name
 what's in a name that which we call a rose
 by any other name would smell as sweet
 so romeo would were he not romeo call'd
 retain that dear perfection which he owes
 without that title romeo doff thy name
 and for that name which is no part of thee
 take all myself
romeo i take thee at thy word
 call me but love and i'll be new baptized
 henceforth i never will be romeo
juliet what man art thou that thus bescreen'd in night
 so stumblest on my counsel
romeo by a name
 i know not how to tell thee who i am
 my name dear saint is hateful to myself
 because it is an enemy to thee
 had i it written i would tear the word
juliet my ears have not yet drunk a hundred words
 of that tongue's utterance yet i know the sound
 art thou not romeo and a montague
romeo neither fair saint if either thee dislike
juliet how camest thou hither tell me and wherefore
 the orchard walls are high and hard to climb
 and the place death considering who thou art
 if any of my kinsmen find thee here
romeo with love's light wings did i o'erperch these walls
 for stony limits cannot hold love out
 and what love can do that dares love attempt
 therefore thy kinsmen are no let to me
juliet if they do see thee they will murder thee
romeo alack there lies more peril in thine eye
 than twenty of their swords look thou but sweet
 and i am proof against their enmity
juliet i would not for the world they saw thee here
romeo i have night's cloak to hide me from their sight
 and but thou love me let them find me here
 my life were better ended by their hate
 than death prorogued wanting of thy love
