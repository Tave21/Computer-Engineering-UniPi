and moses told the children of israel according to all that the lord commanded moses
and moses spake unto the heads of the tribes concerning the children of israel saying this is the thing which the lord hath commanded
if a man vow a vow unto the lord or swear an oath to bind his soul with a bond he shall not break his word he shall do according to all that proceedeth out of his mouth
if a woman also vow a vow unto the lord and bind herself by a bond being in her father's house in her youth
and her father hear her vow and her bond wherewith she hath bound her soul and her father shall hold his peace at her then all her vows shall stand and every bond wherewith she hath bound her soul shall stand
but if her father disallow her in the day that he heareth not any of her vows or of her bonds wherewith she hath bound her soul shall stand and the lord shall forgive her because her father disallowed her
and if she had at all an husband when she vowed or uttered ought out of her lips wherewith she bound her soul
and her husband heard it and held his peace at her in the day that he heard it then her vows shall stand and her bonds wherewith she bound her soul shall stand
but if her husband disallowed her on the day that he heard it then he shall make her vow which she vowed and that which she uttered with her lips wherewith she bound her soul of none effect and the lord shall forgive her
but every vow of a widow and of her that is divorced wherewith they have bound their souls shall stand against her
and if she vowed in her husband's house or bound her soul by a bond with an oath
and her husband heard it and held his peace at her and disallowed her not then all her vows shall stand and every bond wherewith she bound her soul shall stand
but if her husband hath utterly made them void on the day he heard them then whatsoever proceeded out of her lips concerning her vows or concerning the bond of her soul shall not stand her husband hath made them void and the lord shall forgive her
every vow and every binding oath to afflict the soul her husband may establish it or her husband may make it void
but if her husband altogether hold his peace at her from day to day then he establisheth all her vows or all her bonds which are upon her he confirmeth them because he held his peace at her in the day that he heard them
but if he shall any ways make them void after that he hath heard them then he shall bear her iniquity
these are the statutes which the lord commanded moses between a man and his wife between the father and his daughter being yet in her youth in her father's house
and the lord spake unto moses saying
avenge the children of israel of the midianites afterward shalt thou be gathered unto thy people
and moses spake unto the people saying arm some of yourselves unto the war and let them go against the midianites and avenge the lord of midian
of every tribe a thousand throughout all the tribes of israel shall ye send to the war
so there were delivered out of the thousands of israel a thousand of every tribe twelve thousand armed for war
and moses sent them to the war a thousand of every tribe them and phinehas the son of eleazar the priest to the war with the holy instruments and the trumpets to blow in his hand
and they warred against the midianites as the lord commanded moses and they slew all the males
and they slew the kings of midian beside the rest of them that were slain namely evi and rekem and zur and hur and reba five kings of midian balaam also the son of beor they slew with the sword
and the children of israel took all the women of midian captives and their little ones and took the spoil of all their cattle and all their flocks and all their goods
and they burnt all their cities wherein they dwelt and all their goodly castles with fire
and they took all the spoil and all the prey both of men and of beasts
and they brought the captives and the prey and the spoil unto moses and eleazar the priest and unto the congregation of the children of israel unto the camp at the plains of moab which are by jordan near jericho
and moses and eleazar the priest and all the princes of the congregation went forth to meet them without the camp
and moses was wroth with the officers of the host with the captains over thousands and captains over hundreds which came from the battle
and moses said unto them have ye saved all the women alive
behold these caused the children of israel through the counsel of balaam to commit trespass against the lord in the matter of peor and there was a plague among the congregation of the lord
now therefore kill every male among the little ones and kill every woman that hath known man by lying with him
but all the women children that have not known a man by lying with him keep alive for yourselves
and do ye abide without the camp seven days whosoever hath killed any person and whosoever hath touched any slain purify both yourselves and your captives on the third day and on the seventh day
and purify all your raiment and all that is made of skins and all work of goats hair and all things made of wood
and eleazar the priest said unto the men of war which went to the battle this is the ordinance of the law which the lord commanded moses
only the gold and the silver the brass the iron the tin and the lead
every thing that may abide the fire ye shall make it go through the fire and it shall be clean nevertheless it shall be purified with the water of separation and all that abideth not the fire ye shall make go through the water
and ye shall wash your clothes on the seventh day and ye shall be clean and afterward ye shall come into the camp
and the lord spake unto moses saying
take the sum of the prey that was taken both of man and of beast thou and eleazar the priest and the chief fathers of the congregation
and divide the prey into two parts between them that took the war upon them who went out to battle and between all the congregation
and levy a tribute unto the lord of the men of war which went out to battle one soul of five hundred both of the persons and of the beeves and of the asses and of the sheep
take it of their half and give it unto eleazar the priest for an heave offering of the lord
and of the children of israel's half thou shalt take one portion of fifty of the persons of the beeves of the asses and of the flocks of all manner of beasts and give them unto the levites which keep the charge of the tabernacle of the lord
and moses and eleazar the priest did as the lord commanded moses
and the booty being the rest of the prey which the men of war had caught was six hundred thousand and seventy thousand and five thousand sheep
and threescore and twelve thousand beeves
and threescore and one thousand asses
and thirty and two thousand persons in all of women that had not known man by lying with him
and the half which was the portion of them that went out to war was in number three hundred thousand and seven and thirty thousand and five hundred sheep
and the lord's tribute of the sheep was six hundred and threescore and fifteen
and the beeves were thirty and six thousand of which the lord's tribute was threescore and twelve
and the asses were thirty thousand and five hundred of which the lord's tribute was threescore and one
and the persons were sixteen thousand of which the lord's tribute was thirty and two persons
and moses gave the tribute which was the lord's heave offering unto eleazar the priest as the lord commanded moses
and of the children of israel's half which moses divided from the men that warred
now the half that pertained unto the congregation was three hundred thousand and thirty thousand and seven thousand and five hundred sheep
and thirty and six thousand beeves
and thirty thousand asses and five hundred
and sixteen thousand persons
even of the children of israel's half moses took one portion of fifty both of man and of beast and gave them unto the levites which kept the charge of the tabernacle of the lord as the lord commanded moses
and the officers which were over thousands of the host the captains of thousands and captains of hundreds came near unto moses
and they said unto moses thy servants have taken the sum of the men of war which are under our charge and there lacketh not one man of us
we have therefore brought an oblation for the lord what every man hath gotten of jewels of gold chains and bracelets rings earrings and tablets to make an atonement for our souls before the lord
and moses and eleazar the priest took the gold of them even all wrought jewels
and all the gold of the offering that they offered up to the lord of the captains of thousands and of the captains of hundreds was sixteen thousand seven hundred and fifty shekels
for the men of war had taken spoil every man for himself
and moses and eleazar the priest took the gold of the captains of thousands and of hundreds and brought it into the tabernacle of the congregation for a memorial for the children of israel before the lord
now the children of reuben and the children of gad had a very great multitude of cattle and when they saw the land of jazer and the land of gilead that behold the place was a place for cattle
the children of gad and the children of reuben came and spake unto moses and to eleazar the priest and unto the princes of the congregation saying
ataroth and dibon and jazer and nimrah and heshbon and elealeh and shebam and nebo and beon
even the country which the lord smote before the congregation of israel is a land for cattle and thy servants have cattle
wherefore said they if we have found grace in thy sight let this land be given unto thy servants for a possession and bring us not over jordan
and moses said unto the children of gad and to the children of reuben shall your brethren go to war and shall ye sit here
and wherefore discourage ye the heart of the children of israel from going over into the land which the lord hath given them
thus did your fathers when i sent them from kadeshbarnea to see the land
for when they went up unto the valley of eshcol and saw the land they discouraged the heart of the children of israel that they should not go into the land which the lord had given them
and the lord's anger was kindled the same time and he sware saying
surely none of the men that came up out of egypt from twenty years old and upward shall see the land which i sware unto abraham unto isaac and unto jacob because they have not wholly followed me
save caleb the son of jephunneh the kenezite and joshua the son of nun for they have wholly followed the lord
and the lord's anger was kindled against israel and he made them wander in the wilderness forty years until all the generation that had done evil in the sight of the lord was consumed
and behold ye are risen up in your fathers stead an increase of sinful men to augment yet the fierce anger of the lord toward israel
for if ye turn away from after him he will yet again leave them in the wilderness and ye shall destroy all this people
and they came near unto him and said we will build sheepfolds here for our cattle and cities for our little ones
but we ourselves will go ready armed before the children of israel until we have brought them unto their place and our little ones shall dwell in the fenced cities because of the inhabitants of the land
we will not return unto our houses until the children of israel have inherited every man his inheritance
for we will not inherit with them on yonder side jordan or forward because our inheritance is fallen to us on this side jordan eastward
and moses said unto them if ye will do this thing if ye will go armed before the lord to war
and will go all of you armed over jordan before the lord until he hath driven out his enemies from before him
and the land be subdued before the lord then afterward ye shall return and be guiltless before the lord and before israel and this land shall be your possession before the lord
but if ye will not do so behold ye have sinned against the lord and be sure your sin will find you out
build you cities for your little ones and folds for your sheep and do that which hath proceeded out of your mouth
and the children of gad and the children of reuben spake unto moses saying thy servants will do as my lord commandeth
our little ones our wives our flocks and all our cattle shall be there in the cities of gilead
but thy servants will pass over every man armed for war before the lord to battle as my lord saith
so concerning them moses commanded eleazar the priest and joshua the son of nun and the chief fathers of the tribes of the children of israel
and moses said unto them if the children of gad and the children of reuben will pass with you over jordan every man armed to battle before the lord and the land shall be subdued before you then ye shall give them the land of gilead for a possession
but if they will not pass over with you armed they shall have possessions among you in the land of canaan
and the children of gad and the children of reuben answered saying as the lord hath said unto thy servants so will we do
we will pass over armed before the lord into the land of canaan that the possession of our inheritance on this side jordan may be ours
and moses gave unto them even to the children of gad and to the children of reuben and unto half the tribe of manasseh the son of joseph the kingdom of sihon king of the amorites and the kingdom of og king of bashan the land with the cities thereof in the coasts even the cities of the country round about
and the children of gad built dibon and ataroth and aroer
and atroth shophan and jaazer and jogbehah
and bethnimrah and bethharan fenced cities and folds for sheep
and the children of reuben built heshbon and elealeh and kirjathaim
and nebo and baalmeon their names being changed and shibmah and gave other names unto the cities which they builded
and the children of machir the son of manasseh went to gilead and took it and dispossessed the amorite which was in it
and moses gave gilead unto machir the son of manasseh and he dwelt therein
and jair the son of manasseh went and took the small towns thereof and called them havothjair
and nobah went and took kenath and the villages thereof and called it nobah after his own name
these are the journeys of the children of israel which went forth out of the land of egypt with their armies under the hand of moses and aaron
and moses wrote their goings out according to their journeys by the commandment of the lord and these are their journeys according to their goings out
and they departed from rameses in the first month on the fifteenth day of the first month on the morrow after the passover the children of israel went out with an high hand in the sight of all the egyptians
for the egyptians buried all their firstborn which the lord had smitten among them upon their gods also the lord executed judgments
and the children of israel removed from rameses and pitched in succoth
and they departed from succoth and pitched in etham which is in the edge of the wilderness
