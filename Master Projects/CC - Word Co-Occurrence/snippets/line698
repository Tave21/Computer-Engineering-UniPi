 shall strike his father's crown into the hazard
 tell him he hath made a match with such a wrangler
 that all the courts of france will be disturb'd
 with chaces and we understand him well
 how he comes o'er us with our wilder days
 not measuring what use we made of them
 we never valued this poor seat of england
 and therefore living hence did give ourself
 to barbarous licence as tis ever common
 that men are merriest when they are from home
 but tell the dauphin i will keep my state
 be like a king and show my sail of greatness
 when i do rouse me in my throne of france
 for that i have laid by my majesty
 and plodded like a man for workingdays
 but i will rise there with so full a glory
 that i will dazzle all the eyes of france
 yea strike the dauphin blind to look on us
 and tell the pleasant prince this mock of his
 hath turn'd his balls to gunstones and his soul
 shall stand sore charged for the wasteful vengeance
 that shall fly with them for many a thousand widows
 shall this his mock mock out of their dear husbands
 mock mothers from their sons mock castles down
 and some are yet ungotten and unborn
 that shall have cause to curse the dauphin's scorn
 but this lies all within the will of god
 to whom i do appeal and in whose name
 tell you the dauphin i am coming on
 to venge me as i may and to put forth
 my rightful hand in a wellhallow'd cause
 so get you hence in peace and tell the dauphin
 his jest will savour but of shallow wit
 when thousands weep more than did laugh at it
 convey them with safe conduct fare you well
 exeunt ambassadors
exeter this was a merry message
king henry v we hope to make the sender blush at it
 therefore my lords omit no happy hour
 that may give furtherance to our expedition
 for we have now no thought in us but france
 save those to god that run before our business
 therefore let our proportions for these wars
 be soon collected and all things thought upon
 that may with reasonable swiftness add
 more feathers to our wings for god before
 we'll chide this dauphin at his father's door
 therefore let every man now task his thought
 that this fair action may on foot be brought
 exeunt flourish
 king henry v
act ii
 prologue
 enter chorus
chorus now all the youth of england are on fire
 and silken dalliance in the wardrobe lies
 now thrive the armourers and honour's thought
 reigns solely in the breast of every man
 they sell the pasture now to buy the horse
 following the mirror of all christian kings
 with winged heels as english mercuries
 for now sits expectation in the air
 and hides a sword from hilts unto the point
 with crowns imperial crowns and coronets
 promised to harry and his followers
 the french advised by good intelligence
 of this most dreadful preparation
 shake in their fear and with pale policy
 seek to divert the english purposes
 o england model to thy inward greatness
 like little body with a mighty heart
 what mightst thou do that honour would thee do
 were all thy children kind and natural
 but see thy fault france hath in thee found out
 a nest of hollow bosoms which he fills
 with treacherous crowns and three corrupted men
 one richard earl of cambridge and the second
 henry lord scroop of masham and the third
 sir thomas grey knight of northumberland
 have for the gilt of franceo guilt indeed
 confirm'd conspiracy with fearful france
 and by their hands this grace of kings must die
 if hell and treason hold their promises
 ere he take ship for france and in southampton
 linger your patience on and we'll digest
 the abuse of distance force a play
 the sum is paid the traitors are agreed
 the king is set from london and the scene
 is now transported gentles to southampton
 there is the playhouse now there must you sit
 and thence to france shall we convey you safe
 and bring you back charming the narrow seas
 to give you gentle pass for if we may
 we'll not offend one stomach with our play
 but till the king come forth and not till then
 unto southampton do we shift our scene
 exit
