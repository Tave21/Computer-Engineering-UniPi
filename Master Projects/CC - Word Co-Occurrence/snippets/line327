 exit
tamora now will i to that old andronicus
 and temper him with all the art i have
 to pluck proud lucius from the warlike goths
 and now sweet emperor be blithe again
 and bury all thy fear in my devices
saturninus then go successantly and plead to him
 exeunt
 titus andronicus
act v
scene i plains near rome
 enter lucius with an army of goths with drum and colours
lucius approved warriors and my faithful friends
 i have received letters from great rome
 which signify what hate they bear their emperor
 and how desirous of our sight they are
 therefore great lords be as your titles witness
 imperious and impatient of your wrongs
 and wherein rome hath done you any scath
 let him make treble satisfaction
first goth brave slip sprung from the great andronicus
 whose name was once our terror now our comfort
 whose high exploits and honourable deeds
 ingrateful rome requites with foul contempt
 be bold in us we'll follow where thou lead'st
 like stinging bees in hottest summer's day
 led by their master to the flowered fields
 and be avenged on cursed tamora
all the goths and as he saith so say we all with him
lucius i humbly thank him and i thank you all
 but who comes here led by a lusty goth
 enter a goth leading aaron with his child in his arms
second goth renowned lucius from our troops i stray'd
 to gaze upon a ruinous monastery
 and as i earnestly did fix mine eye
 upon the wasted building suddenly
 i heard a child cry underneath a wall
 i made unto the noise when soon i heard
 the crying babe controll'd with this discourse
 peace tawny slave half me and half thy dam
 did not thy hue bewray whose brat thou art
 had nature lent thee but thy mother's look
 villain thou mightst have been an emperor
 but where the bull and cow are both milkwhite
 they never do beget a coalblack calf
 peace villain peace'even thus he rates
 the babe
 for i must bear thee to a trusty goth
 who when he knows thou art the empress babe
 will hold thee dearly for thy mother's sake'
 with this my weapon drawn i rush'd upon him
 surprised him suddenly and brought him hither
 to use as you think needful of the man
lucius o worthy goth this is the incarnate devil
 that robb'd andronicus of his good hand
 this is the pearl that pleased your empress eye
 and here's the base fruit of his burning lust
 say walleyed slave whither wouldst thou convey
 this growing image of thy fiendlike face
 why dost not speak what deaf not a word
 a halter soldiers hang him on this tree
 and by his side his fruit of bastardy
aaron touch not the boy he is of royal blood
lucius too like the sire for ever being good
 first hang the child that he may see it sprawl
 a sight to vex the father's soul withal
 get me a ladder
 a ladder brought which aaron is made to ascend
aaron lucius save the child
 and bear it from me to the empress
 if thou do this i'll show thee wondrous things
 that highly may advantage thee to hear
 if thou wilt not befall what may befall
 i'll speak no more but vengeance rot you all'
lucius say on an if it please me which thou speak'st
 thy child shall live and i will see it nourish'd
aaron an if it please thee why assure thee lucius
 twill vex thy soul to hear what i shall speak
 for i must talk of murders rapes and massacres
 acts of black night abominable deeds
 complots of mischief treason villanies
 ruthful to hear yet piteously perform'd
 and this shall all be buried by my death
 unless thou swear to me my child shall live
lucius tell on thy mind i say thy child shall live
aaron swear that he shall and then i will begin
lucius who should i swear by thou believest no god
 that granted how canst thou believe an oath
aaron what if i do not as indeed i do not
 yet for i know thou art religious
 and hast a thing within thee called conscience
 with twenty popish tricks and ceremonies
 which i have seen thee careful to observe
 therefore i urge thy oath for that i know
 an idiot holds his bauble for a god
 and keeps the oath which by that god he swears
 to that i'll urge him therefore thou shalt vow
 by that same god what god soe'er it be
 that thou adorest and hast in reverence
 to save my boy to nourish and bring him up
 or else i will discover nought to thee
lucius even by my god i swear to thee i will
aaron first know thou i begot him on the empress
lucius o most insatiate and luxurious woman
aaron tut lucius this was but a deed of charity
 to that which thou shalt hear of me anon
 twas her two sons that murder'd bassianus
 they cut thy sister's tongue and ravish'd her
 and cut her hands and trimm'd her as thou saw'st
lucius o detestable villain call'st thou that trimming
aaron why she was wash'd and cut and trimm'd and twas
 trim sport for them that had the doing of it
lucius o barbarous beastly villains like thyself
aaron indeed i was their tutor to instruct them
 that codding spirit had they from their mother
 as sure a card as ever won the set
 that bloody mind i think they learn'd of me
 as true a dog as ever fought at head
 well let my deeds be witness of my worth
 i train'd thy brethren to that guileful hole
 where the dead corpse of bassianus lay
 i wrote the letter that thy father found
 and hid the gold within the letter mention'd
 confederate with the queen and her two sons
 and what not done that thou hast cause to rue
 wherein i had no stroke of mischief in it
 i play'd the cheater for thy father's hand
 and when i had it drew myself apart
 and almost broke my heart with extreme laughter
 i pry'd me through the crevice of a wall
 when for his hand he had his two sons heads
 beheld his tears and laugh'd so heartily
 that both mine eyes were rainy like to his 
 and when i told the empress of this sport
 she swooned almost at my pleasing tale
 and for my tidings gave me twenty kisses
first goth what canst thou say all this and never blush
aaron ay like a black dog as the saying is
lucius art thou not sorry for these heinous deeds
aaron ay that i had not done a thousand more
 even now i curse the dayand yet i think
 few come within the compass of my curse
 wherein i did not some notorious ill
 as kill a man or else devise his death
 ravish a maid or plot the way to do it
 accuse some innocent and forswear myself
 set deadly enmity between two friends
 make poor men's cattle break their necks
 set fire on barns and haystacks in the night
 and bid the owners quench them with their tears
 oft have i digg'd up dead men from their graves
 and set them upright at their dear friends doors
 even when their sorrows almost were forgot
 and on their skins as on the bark of trees
 have with my knife carved in roman letters
 let not your sorrow die though i am dead'
 tut i have done a thousand dreadful things
 as willingly as one would kill a fly
 and nothing grieves me heartily indeed
 but that i cannot do ten thousand more
lucius bring down the devil for he must not die
 so sweet a death as hanging presently
aaron if there be devils would i were a devil
 to live and burn in everlasting fire
 so i might have your company in hell
 but to torment you with my bitter tongue
lucius sirs stop his mouth and let him speak no more
 enter a goth
third goth my lord there is a messenger from rome
 desires to be admitted to your presence
lucius let him come near
 enter aemilius
 welcome aemilius what's the news from rome
aemilius lord lucius and you princes of the goths
 the roman emperor greets you all by me
 and for he understands you are in arms
 he craves a parley at your father's house
 willing you to demand your hostages
 and they shall be immediately deliver'd
first goth what says our general
lucius aemilius let the emperor give his pledges
 unto my father and my uncle marcus
 and we will come march away
 exeunt
 titus andronicus
act v
scene ii rome before titus's house
 enter tamora demetrius and chiron disguised
tamora thus in this strange and sad habiliment
 i will encounter with andronicus
 and say i am revenge sent from below
 to join with him and right his heinous wrongs
 knock at his study where they say he keeps
 to ruminate strange plots of dire revenge
 tell him revenge is come to join with him
 and work confusion on his enemies
 they knock
 enter titus above
titus andronicus who doth molest my contemplation
 is it your trick to make me ope the door
