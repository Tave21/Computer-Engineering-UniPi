isabella i am directed by you
duke vincentio this letter then to friar peter give
 tis that he sent me of the duke's return
 say by this token i desire his company
 at mariana's house tonight her cause and yours

 before the duke and to the head of angelo
 accuse him home and home for my poor self
 i am combined by a sacred vow
 and shall be absent wend you with this letter
 command these fretting waters from your eyes
 with a light heart trust not my holy order
 if i pervert your course who's here
 enter lucio
lucio good even friar where's the provost
duke vincentio not within sir
lucio o pretty isabella i am pale at mine heart to see
 thine eyes so red thou must be patient i am fain
 to dine and sup with water and bran i dare not for
 my head fill my belly one fruitful meal would set
 me to t but they say the duke will be here
 tomorrow by my troth isabel i loved thy brother
 if the old fantastical duke of dark corners had been
 at home he had lived
 exit isabella
duke vincentio sir the duke is marvellous little beholding to your
 reports but the best is he lives not in them
lucio friar thou knowest not the duke so well as i do
 he's a better woodman than thou takest him for
duke vincentio well you'll answer this one day fare ye well
lucio nay tarry i'll go along with thee
 i can tell thee pretty tales of the duke
duke vincentio you have told me too many of him already sir if
 they be true if not true none were enough
lucio i was once before him for getting a wench with child
duke vincentio did you such a thing
lucio yes marry did i but i was fain to forswear it
 they would else have married me to the rotten medlar
duke vincentio sir your company is fairer than honest rest you well
lucio by my troth i'll go with thee to the lane's end
 if bawdy talk offend you we'll have very little of
 it nay friar i am a kind of burr i shall stick

act iv
scene iv a room in angelo's house
 enter angelo and escalus
escalus every letter he hath writ hath disvouched other
angelo in most uneven and distracted manner his actions
 show much like to madness pray heaven his wisdom be
 not tainted and why meet him at the gates and
 redeliver our authorities there
escalus i guess not
angelo and why should we proclaim it in an hour before his
 entering that if any crave redress of injustice
 they should exhibit their petitions in the street
escalus he shows his reason for that to have a dispatch of
 complaints and to deliver us from devices
 hereafter which shall then have no power to stand
 against us
angelo well i beseech you let it be proclaimed betimes
 i the morn i'll call you at your house give
 notice to such men of sort and suit as are to meet
 him
escalus i shall sir fare you well
angelo good night
 exit escalus
 this deed unshapes me quite makes me unpregnant
 and dull to all proceedings a deflower'd maid
 and by an eminent body that enforced
 the law against it but that her tender shame
 will not proclaim against her maiden loss
 how might she tongue me yet reason dares her no
 for my authority bears of a credent bulk
 that no particular scandal once can touch
 but it confounds the breather he should have lived
 save that riotous youth with dangerous sense
 might in the times to come have ta'en revenge
 by so receiving a dishonour'd life
 with ransom of such shame would yet he had lived
 a lack when once our grace we have forgot
 nothing goes right we would and we would not

 enter duke vincentio in his own habit and friar peter
duke vincentio these letters at fit time deliver me
 giving letters
 the provost knows our purpose and our plot
 the matter being afoot keep your instruction
 and hold you ever to our special drift
 though sometimes you do blench from this to that
 as cause doth minister go call at flavius house
 and tell him where i stay give the like notice
 to valentinus rowland and to crassus
 and bid them bring the trumpets to the gate
 but send me flavius first
friar peter it shall be speeded well

 enter isabella and mariana
isabella to speak so indirectly i am loath
 i would say the truth but to accuse him so
 that is your part yet i am advised to do it
 he says to veil full purpose

isabella besides he tells me that if peradventure
 he speak against me on the adverse side
 i should not think it strange for tis a physic
 that's bitter to sweet end
mariana i would friar peter
isabella o peace the friar is come

 our old and faithful friend we are glad to see you
angelo 
 happy return be to your royal grace
escalus 
duke vincentio many and hearty thankings to you both
 we have made inquiry of you and we hear
 such goodness of your justice that our soul
 cannot but yield you forth to public thanks
 forerunning more requital
angelo you make my bonds still greater
duke vincentio o your desert speaks loud and i should wrong it
 to lock it in the wards of covert bosom
 when it deserves with characters of brass
 a forted residence gainst the tooth of time
 and razure of oblivion give me your hand
 and let the subject see to make them know
 that outward courtesies would fain proclaim
 favours that keep within come escalus
 you must walk by us on our other hand
 and good supporters are you
 friar peter and isabella come forward
friar peter now is your time speak loud and kneel before him
isabella justice o royal duke vail your regard
 upon a wrong'd i would fain have said a maid
 o worthy prince dishonour not your eye
 by throwing it on any other object
 till you have heard me in my true complaint
 and given me justice justice justice justice
duke vincentio relate your wrongs in what by whom be brief
 here is lord angelo shall give you justice
 reveal yourself to him
isabella o worthy duke
 you bid me seek redemption of the devil
 hear me yourself for that which i must speak
 must either punish me not being believed
 or wring redress from you hear me o hear me here
angelo my lord her wits i fear me are not firm
 she hath been a suitor to me for her brother
 cut off by course of justice
isabella by course of justice
angelo and she will speak most bitterly and strange
isabella most strange but yet most truly will i speak
 that angelo's forsworn is it not strange
 that angelo's a murderer is t not strange
 that angelo is an adulterous thief
 an hypocrite a virginviolator
 is it not strange and strange
duke vincentio nay it is ten times strange
isabella it is not truer he is angelo
 than this is all as true as it is strange
 nay it is ten times true for truth is truth
 to the end of reckoning
duke vincentio away with her poor soul
 she speaks this in the infirmity of sense
isabella o prince i conjure thee as thou believest
 there is another comfort than this world
 that thou neglect me not with that opinion
 that i am touch'd with madness make not impossible
 that which but seems unlike tis not impossible
 but one the wicked'st caitiff on the ground
 may seem as shy as grave as just as absolute
 as angelo even so may angelo
 in all his dressings characts titles forms
 be an archvillain believe it royal prince
