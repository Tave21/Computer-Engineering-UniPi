 what answer makes king lewis unto our letters
post at my depart these were his very words
 go tell false edward thy supposed king
 that lewis of france is sending over masquers
 to revel it with him and his new bride'
king edward iv is lewis so brave belike he thinks me henry
 but what said lady bona to my marriage
post these were her words utter'd with mad disdain
 tell him in hope he'll prove a widower shortly
 i'll wear the willow garland for his sake'
king edward iv i blame not her she could say little less
 she had the wrong but what said henry's queen
 for i have heard that she was there in place
post tell him quoth she my mourning weeds are done
 and i am ready to put armour on'
king edward iv belike she minds to play the amazon
 but what said warwick to these injuries
post he more incensed against your majesty
 than all the rest discharged me with these words
 tell him from me that he hath done me wrong
 and therefore i'll uncrown him ere't be long'
king edward iv ha durst the traitor breathe out so proud words
 well i will arm me being thus forewarn'd
 they shall have wars and pay for their presumption
 but say is warwick friends with margaret
post ay gracious sovereign they are so link'd in
 friendship
 that young prince edward marries warwick's daughter
clarence belike the elder clarence will have the younger
 now brother king farewell and sit you fast
 for i will hence to warwick's other daughter
 that though i want a kingdom yet in marriage
 i may not prove inferior to yourself
 you that love me and warwick follow me
 exit clarence and somerset follows
gloucester aside not i
 my thoughts aim at a further matter i
 stay not for the love of edward but the crown
king edward iv clarence and somerset both gone to warwick
 yet am i arm'd against the worst can happen
 and haste is needful in this desperate case
 pembroke and stafford you in our behalf
 go levy men and make prepare for war
 they are already or quickly will be landed
 myself in person will straight follow you
 exeunt pembroke and stafford
 but ere i go hastings and montague
 resolve my doubt you twain of all the rest
 are near to warwick by blood and by alliance
 tell me if you love warwick more than me
 if it be so then both depart to him
 i rather wish you foes than hollow friends
 but if you mind to hold your true obedience
 give me assurance with some friendly vow
 that i may never have you in suspect
montague so god help montague as he proves true
hastings and hastings as he favours edward's cause
king edward iv now brother richard will you stand by us
gloucester ay in despite of all that shall withstand you
king edward iv why so then am i sure of victory
 now therefore let us hence and lose no hour
 till we meet warwick with his foreign power

act iv
scene ii a plain in warwickshire
 enter warwick and oxford with french soldiers
warwick trust me my lord all hitherto goes well
 the common people by numbers swarm to us
 enter clarence and somerset
 but see where somerset and clarence come
 speak suddenly my lords are we all friends
clarence fear not that my lord
warwick then gentle clarence welcome unto warwick
 and welcome somerset i hold it cowardice
 to rest mistrustful where a noble heart
 hath pawn'd an open hand in sign of love
 else might i think that clarence edward's brother
 were but a feigned friend to our proceedings
 but welcome sweet clarence my daughter shall be thine
 and now what rests but in night's coverture
 thy brother being carelessly encamp'd
 his soldiers lurking in the towns about
 and but attended by a simple guard
 we may surprise and take him at our pleasure
 our scouts have found the adventure very easy
 that as ulysses and stout diomede
 with sleight and manhood stole to rhesus tents
 and brought from thence the thracian fatal steeds
 so we well cover'd with the night's black mantle
 at unawares may beat down edward's guard
 and seize himself i say not slaughter him
 for i intend but only to surprise him
 you that will follow me to this attempt
 applaud the name of henry with your leader
 they all cry henry'
 why then let's on our way in silent sort
 for warwick and his friends god and saint george

 3 king henry vi
act iv
scene iii edward's camp near warwick
 enter three watchmen to guard king edward iv's tent
first watchman come on my masters each man take his stand
 the king by this is set him down to sleep
second watchman what will he not to bed
first watchman why no for he hath made a solemn vow
 never to lie and take his natural rest
 till warwick or himself be quite suppress'd
second watchman tomorrow then belike shall be the day
 if warwick be so near as men report
third watchman but say i pray what nobleman is that
 that with the king here resteth in his tent
first watchman tis the lord hastings the king's chiefest friend
third watchman o is it so but why commands the king
 that his chief followers lodge in towns about him
 while he himself keeps in the cold field
second watchman tis the more honour because more dangerous
third watchman ay but give me worship and quietness
 i like it better than a dangerous honour
 if warwick knew in what estate he stands
 tis to be doubted he would waken him
first watchman unless our halberds did shut up his passage
second watchman ay wherefore else guard we his royal tent
 but to defend his person from nightfoes
 enter warwick clarence oxford somerset and
 french soldiers silent all
warwick this is his tent and see where stand his guard
 courage my masters honour now or never
 but follow me and edward shall be ours
first watchman who goes there
second watchman stay or thou diest
 warwick and the rest cry all warwick warwick'
 and set upon the guard who fly crying arm
 arm warwick and the rest following them
 the drum playing and trumpet sounding reenter
 warwick somerset and the rest bringing king
 edward iv out in his gown sitting in a chair
 richard and hastings fly over the stage
somerset what are they that fly there
warwick richard and hastings let them go here is the duke
king edward iv the duke why warwick when we parted
 thou call'dst me king
warwick ay but the case is alter'd
 when you disgraced me in my embassade
 then i degraded you from being king
 and come now to create you duke of york
 alas how should you govern any kingdom
 that know not how to use ambassadors
 nor how to be contented with one wife
 nor how to use your brothers brotherly
 nor how to study for the people's welfare
 nor how to shroud yourself from enemies
king edward iv yea brother of clarence are thou here too
 nay then i see that edward needs must down
 yet warwick in despite of all mischance
 of thee thyself and all thy complices
 edward will always bear himself as king
 though fortune's malice overthrow my state
 my mind exceeds the compass of her wheel
warwick then for his mind be edward england's king
 takes off his crown
 but henry now shall wear the english crown
 and be true king indeed thou but the shadow
 my lord of somerset at my request
 see that forthwith duke edward be convey'd
 unto my brother archbishop of york
 when i have fought with pembroke and his fellows
 i'll follow you and tell what answer
 lewis and the lady bona send to him
 now for a while farewell good duke of york
 they lead him out forcibly
king edward iv what fates impose that men must needs abide
 it boots not to resist both wind and tide
 exit guarded
oxford what now remains my lords for us to do
 but march to london with our soldiers
warwick ay that's the first thing that we have to do
 to free king henry from imprisonment
 and see him seated in the regal throne
 exeunt
 3 king henry vi
act iv
scene iv london the palace
 enter queen elizabeth and rivers
rivers madam what makes you in this sudden change
queen elizabeth why brother rivers are you yet to learn
 what late misfortune is befall'n king edward
rivers what loss of some pitch'd battle against warwick
queen elizabeth no but the loss of his own royal person
rivers then is my sovereign slain
queen elizabeth ay almost slain for he is taken prisoner
 either betray'd by falsehood of his guard
 or by his foe surprised at unawares
 and as i further have to understand
 is new committed to the bishop of york
 fell warwick's brother and by that our foe
rivers these news i must confess are full of grief
 yet gracious madam bear it as you may
 warwick may lose that now hath won the day
