dromio of syracuse marry sir she's the kitchen wench and all grease
 and i know not what use to put her to but to make a
 lamp of her and run from her by her own light i
 warrant her rags and the tallow in them will burn a
 poland winter if she lives till doomsday
 she'll burn a week longer than the whole world
antipholus
of syracuse what complexion is she of
dromio of syracuse swart like my shoe but her face nothing half so
 clean kept for why she sweats a man may go over
 shoes in the grime of it
antipholus
of syracuse that's a fault that water will mend
dromio of syracuse no sir tis in grain noah's flood could not do it
antipholus
of syracuse what's her name
dromio of syracuse nell sir but her name and three quarters that's
 an ell and three quarters will not measure her from
 hip to hip
antipholus
of syracuse then she bears some breadth
dromio of syracuse no longer from head to foot than from hip to hip
 she is spherical like a globe i could find out
 countries in her
antipholus
of syracuse in what part of her body stands ireland
dromio of syracuse marry in her buttocks i found it out by the bogs
antipholus
of syracuse where scotland
dromio of syracuse i found it by the barrenness hard in the palm of the hand
antipholus
of syracuse where france
dromio of syracuse in her forehead armed and reverted making war
 against her heir
antipholus
of syracuse where england
dromio of syracuse i looked for the chalky cliffs but i could find no
 whiteness in them but i guess it stood in her chin
 by the salt rheum that ran between france and it
antipholus
of syracuse where spain
dromio of syracuse faith i saw it not but i felt it hot in her breath
antipholus
of syracuse where america the indies
dromio of syracuse oh sir upon her nose all o'er embellished with
 rubies carbuncles sapphires declining their rich
 aspect to the hot breath of spain who sent whole
 armadoes of caracks to be ballast at her nose
antipholus
of syracuse where stood belgia the netherlands
dromio of syracuse oh sir i did not look so low to conclude this
 drudge or diviner laid claim to me call'd me
 dromio swore i was assured to her told me what
 privy marks i had about me as the mark of my
 shoulder the mole in my neck the great wart on my
 left arm that i amazed ran from her as a witch
 and i think if my breast had not been made of
 faith and my heart of steel
 she had transform'd me to a curtal dog and made
 me turn i the wheel
antipholus
of syracuse go hie thee presently post to the road
 an if the wind blow any way from shore
 i will not harbour in this town tonight
 if any bark put forth come to the mart
 where i will walk till thou return to me
 if every one knows us and we know none
 tis time i think to trudge pack and be gone
dromio of syracuse as from a bear a man would run for life
 so fly i from her that would be my wife
 exit
antipholus
of syracuse there's none but witches do inhabit here
 and therefore tis high time that i were hence
 she that doth call me husband even my soul
 doth for a wife abhor but her fair sister
 possess'd with such a gentle sovereign grace
 of such enchanting presence and discourse
 hath almost made me traitor to myself
 but lest myself be guilty to selfwrong
 i'll stop mine ears against the mermaid's song
 enter angelo with the chain
angelo master antipholus
antipholus
of syracuse ay that's my name
angelo i know it well sir lo here is the chain

 for fear you ne'er see chain nor money more
angelo you are a merry man sir fare you well
 exit
antipholus
of syracuse what i should think of this i cannot tell
 but this i think there's no man is so vain
 that would refuse so fair an offer'd chain
 i see a man here needs not live by shifts
 when in the streets he meets such golden gifts
 i'll to the mart and there for dromio stay
 if any ship put out then straight away
 exit
 the comedy of errors
act iv
scene i a public place
 enter second merchant angelo and an officer
second merchant you know since pentecost the sum is due
 and since i have not much importuned you
 nor now i had not but that i am bound
 to persia and want guilders for my voyage
 therefore make present satisfaction
 or i'll attach you by this officer
angelo even just the sum that i do owe to you
 is growing to me by antipholus
 and in the instant that i met with you
 he had of me a chain at five o'clock
 i shall receive the money for the same
 pleaseth you walk with me down to his house
 i will discharge my bond and thank you too
 enter antipholus of ephesus and dromio of ephesus
 from the courtezan's
officer that labour may you save see where he comes
antipholus
of ephesus while i go to the goldsmith's house go thou
 and buy a rope's end that will i bestow
 among my wife and her confederates
 for locking me out of my doors by day
 but soft i see the goldsmith get thee gone
 buy thou a rope and bring it home to me
dromio of ephesus i buy a thousand pound a year i buy a rope
 exit
antipholus
of ephesus a man is well holp up that trusts to you
 i promised your presence and the chain
 but neither chain nor goldsmith came to me
 belike you thought our love would last too long
 if it were chain'd together and therefore came not
angelo saving your merry humour here's the note
 how much your chain weighs to the utmost carat
 the fineness of the gold and chargeful fashion
 which doth amount to three odd ducats more
 than i stand debted to this gentleman
 i pray you see him presently discharged
 for he is bound to sea and stays but for it
antipholus
of ephesus i am not furnish'd with the present money
 besides i have some business in the town
 good signior take the stranger to my house
 and with you take the chain and bid my wife
 disburse the sum on the receipt thereof
 perchance i will be there as soon as you
angelo then you will bring the chain to her yourself
antipholus
of ephesus no bear it with you lest i come not time enough
angelo well sir i will have you the chain about you
antipholus
of ephesus an if i have not sir i hope you have
 or else you may return without your money
angelo nay come i pray you sir give me the chain
 both wind and tide stays for this gentleman
 and i to blame have held him here too long
antipholus
of ephesus good lord you use this dalliance to excuse
 your breach of promise to the porpentine
 i should have chid you for not bringing it
 but like a shrew you first begin to brawl
second merchant the hour steals on i pray you sir dispatch
angelo you hear how he importunes methe chain
antipholus
of ephesus why give it to my wife and fetch your money
angelo come come you know i gave it you even now
 either send the chain or send me by some token
antipholus
of ephesus fie now you run this humour out of breath
 where's the chain i pray you let me see it
second merchant my business cannot brook this dalliance
 good sir say whether you'll answer me or no
 if not i'll leave him to the officer
antipholus
of ephesus i answer you what should i answer you
angelo the money that you owe me for the chain
antipholus
of ephesus i owe you none till i receive the chain
angelo you know i gave it you half an hour since
antipholus
of ephesus you gave me none you wrong me much to say so
angelo you wrong me more sir in denying it
 consider how it stands upon my credit
second merchant well officer arrest him at my suit
officer i do and charge you in the duke's name to obey me
angelo this touches me in reputation
