 that so my sad decrees may fly away
 and all my study be to no effect
 you are deceived for what i mean to do
 see here in bloody lines i have set down
 and what is written shall be executed
tamora titus i am come to talk with thee
titus andronicus no not a word how can i grace my talk
 wanting a hand to give it action
 thou hast the odds of me therefore no more
tamora if thou didst know me thou wouldest talk with me
titus andronicus i am not mad i know thee well enough
 witness this wretched stump witness these crimson lines
 witness these trenches made by grief and care
 witness the tiring day and heavy night
 witness all sorrow that i know thee well
 for our proud empress mighty tamora
 is not thy coming for my other hand
tamora know thou sad man i am not tamora
 she is thy enemy and i thy friend
 i am revenge sent from the infernal kingdom
 to ease the gnawing vulture of thy mind
 by working wreakful vengeance on thy foes
 come down and welcome me to this world's light
 confer with me of murder and of death
 there's not a hollow cave or lurkingplace
 no vast obscurity or misty vale
 where bloody murder or detested rape
 can couch for fear but i will find them out
 and in their ears tell them my dreadful name
 revenge which makes the foul offender quake
titus andronicus art thou revenge and art thou sent to me
 to be a torment to mine enemies
tamora i am therefore come down and welcome me
titus andronicus do me some service ere i come to thee
 lo by thy side where rape and murder stands
 now give me some surance that thou art revenge
 stab them or tear them on thy chariotwheels
 and then i'll come and be thy waggoner
 and whirl along with thee about the globe
 provide thee two proper palfreys black as jet
 to hale thy vengeful waggon swift away
 and find out murderers in their guilty caves
 and when thy car is loaden with their heads
 i will dismount and by the waggonwheel
 trot like a servile footman all day long
 even from hyperion's rising in the east
 until his very downfall in the sea
 and day by day i'll do this heavy task
 so thou destroy rapine and murder there
tamora these are my ministers and come with me
titus andronicus are these thy ministers what are they call'd
tamora rapine and murder therefore called so
 cause they take vengeance of such kind of men
titus andronicus good lord how like the empress sons they are
 and you the empress but we worldly men
 have miserable mad mistaking eyes
 o sweet revenge now do i come to thee
 and if one arm's embracement will content thee
 i will embrace thee in it by and by
 exit above
tamora this closing with him fits his lunacy
 whate'er i forge to feed his brainsick fits
 do you uphold and maintain in your speeches
 for now he firmly takes me for revenge
 and being credulous in this mad thought
 i'll make him send for lucius his son
 and whilst i at a banquet hold him sure
 i'll find some cunning practise out of hand
 to scatter and disperse the giddy goths
 or at the least make them his enemies
 see here he comes and i must ply my theme
 enter titus below
titus andronicus long have i been forlorn and all for thee
 welcome dread fury to my woful house
 rapine and murder you are welcome too
 how like the empress and her sons you are
 well are you fitted had you but a moor
 could not all hell afford you such a devil
 for well i wot the empress never wags
 but in her company there is a moor
 and would you represent our queen aright
 it were convenient you had such a devil
 but welcome as you are what shall we do
tamora what wouldst thou have us do andronicus
demetrius show me a murderer i'll deal with him
chiron show me a villain that hath done a rape
 and i am sent to be revenged on him
tamora show me a thousand that have done thee wrong
 and i will be revenged on them all
titus andronicus look round about the wicked streets of rome
 and when thou find'st a man that's like thyself
 good murder stab him he's a murderer
 go thou with him and when it is thy hap
 to find another that is like to thee
 good rapine stab him he's a ravisher
 go thou with them and in the emperor's court
 there is a queen attended by a moor
 well mayst thou know her by thy own proportion
 for up and down she doth resemble thee
 i pray thee do on them some violent death
 they have been violent to me and mine
tamora well hast thou lesson'd us this shall we do
 but would it please thee good andronicus
 to send for lucius thy thricevaliant son
 who leads towards rome a band of warlike goths
 and bid him come and banquet at thy house
 when he is here even at thy solemn feast
 i will bring in the empress and her sons
 the emperor himself and all thy foes
 and at thy mercy shalt they stoop and kneel
 and on them shalt thou ease thy angry heart
 what says andronicus to this device
titus andronicus marcus my brother tis sad titus calls
 enter marcus
 go gentle marcus to thy nephew lucius
 thou shalt inquire him out among the goths
 bid him repair to me and bring with him
 some of the chiefest princes of the goths
 bid him encamp his soldiers where they are
 tell him the emperor and the empress too
 feast at my house and he shall feast with them
 this do thou for my love and so let him
 as he regards his aged father's life
marcus andronicus this will i do and soon return again
 exit
tamora now will i hence about thy business
 and take my ministers along with me
titus andronicus nay nay let rape and murder stay with me
 or else i'll call my brother back again
 and cleave to no revenge but lucius
tamora aside to her sons what say you boys will you
 bide with him
 whiles i go tell my lord the emperor
 how i have govern'd our determined jest
 yield to his humour smooth and speak him fair
 and tarry with him till i turn again
titus andronicus aside i know them all though they suppose me mad
 and will o'erreach them in their own devices
 a pair of cursed hellhounds and their dam
demetrius madam depart at pleasure leave us here
tamora farewell andronicus revenge now goes
 to lay a complot to betray thy foes
titus andronicus i know thou dost and sweet revenge farewell
 exit tamora
chiron tell us old man how shall we be employ'd
titus andronicus tut i have work enough for you to do
 publius come hither caius and valentine
 enter publius and others
publius what is your will
titus andronicus know you these two
publius the empress sons i take them chiron and demetrius
titus andronicus fie publius fie thou art too much deceived
 the one is murder rape is the other's name
 and therefore bind them gentle publius
 caius and valentine lay hands on them
 oft have you heard me wish for such an hour
 and now i find it therefore bind them sure
 and stop their mouths if they begin to cry
 exit
 publius &c lay hold on chiron and demetrius
chiron villains forbear we are the empress sons
publius and therefore do we what we are commanded
 stop close their mouths let them not speak a word
 is he sure bound look that you bind them fast
 reenter titus with lavinia he bearing a knife
 and she a basin
titus andronicus come come lavinia look thy foes are bound
 sirs stop their mouths let them not speak to me
 but let them hear what fearful words i utter
 o villains chiron and demetrius
 here stands the spring whom you have stain'd with mud
 this goodly summer with your winter mix'd
 you kill'd her husband and for that vile fault
 two of her brothers were condemn'd to death
 my hand cut off and made a merry jest
 both her sweet hands her tongue and that more dear
 than hands or tongue her spotless chastity
 inhuman traitors you constrain'd and forced
 what would you say if i should let you speak
 villains for shame you could not beg for grace
 hark wretches how i mean to martyr you
 this one hand yet is left to cut your throats
 whilst that lavinia tween her stumps doth hold
 the basin that receives your guilty blood
 you know your mother means to feast with me
 and calls herself revenge and thinks me mad
 hark villains i will grind your bones to dust
 and with your blood and it i'll make a paste
 and of the paste a coffin i will rear
 and make two pasties of your shameful heads
 and bid that strumpet your unhallow'd dam
 like to the earth swallow her own increase
 this is the feast that i have bid her to
 and this the banquet she shall surfeit on
 for worse than philomel you used my daughter
 and worse than progne i will be revenged
 and now prepare your throats lavinia come
 he cuts their throats
 receive the blood and when that they are dead
 let me go grind their bones to powder small
