and thither were all the flocks gathered and they rolled the stone from the well's mouth and watered the sheep and put the stone again upon the well's mouth in his place
and jacob said unto them my brethren whence be ye and they said of haran are we
and he said unto them know ye laban the son of nahor and they said we know him
and he said unto them is he well and they said he is well and behold rachel his daughter cometh with the sheep
and he said lo it is yet high day neither is it time that the cattle should be gathered together water ye the sheep and go and feed them
and they said we cannot until all the flocks be gathered together and till they roll the stone from the well's mouth then we water the sheep
and while he yet spake with them rachel came with her father's sheep for she kept them
and it came to pass when jacob saw rachel the daughter of laban his mother's brother and the sheep of laban his mother's brother that jacob went near and rolled the stone from the well's mouth and watered the flock of laban his mother's brother
and jacob kissed rachel and lifted up his voice and wept
and jacob told rachel that he was her father's brother and that he was rebekah's son and she ran and told her father
and it came to pass when laban heard the tidings of jacob his sister's son that he ran to meet him and embraced him and kissed him and brought him to his house and he told laban all these things
and laban said to him surely thou art my bone and my flesh and he abode with him the space of a month
and laban said unto jacob because thou art my brother shouldest thou therefore serve me for nought tell me what shall thy wages be
and laban had two daughters the name of the elder was leah and the name of the younger was rachel
leah was tender eyed but rachel was beautiful and well favoured
and jacob loved rachel and said i will serve thee seven years for rachel thy younger daughter
and laban said it is better that i give her to thee than that i should give her to another man abide with me
and jacob served seven years for rachel and they seemed unto him but a few days for the love he had to her
and jacob said unto laban give me my wife for my days are fulfilled that i may go in unto her
and laban gathered together all the men of the place and made a feast
and it came to pass in the evening that he took leah his daughter and brought her to him and he went in unto her
and laban gave unto his daughter leah zilpah his maid for an handmaid
and it came to pass that in the morning behold it was leah and he said to laban what is this thou hast done unto me did not i serve with thee for rachel wherefore then hast thou beguiled me
and laban said it must not be so done in our country to give the younger before the firstborn
fulfil her week and we will give thee this also for the service which thou shalt serve with me yet seven other years
and jacob did so and fulfilled her week and he gave him rachel his daughter to wife also
and laban gave to rachel his daughter bilhah his handmaid to be her maid
and he went in also unto rachel and he loved also rachel more than leah and served with him yet seven other years
and when the lord saw that leah was hated he opened her womb but rachel was barren
and leah conceived and bare a son and she called his name reuben for she said surely the lord hath looked upon my affliction now therefore my husband will love me
and she conceived again and bare a son and said because the lord hath heard that i was hated he hath therefore given me this son also and she called his name simeon
and she conceived again and bare a son and said now this time will my husband be joined unto me because i have born him three sons therefore was his name called levi
and she conceived again and bare a son and she said now will i praise the lord therefore she called his name judah and left bearing
and when rachel saw that she bare jacob no children rachel envied her sister and said unto jacob give me children or else i die
and jacob's anger was kindled against rachel and he said am i in god's stead who hath withheld from thee the fruit of the womb
and she said behold my maid bilhah go in unto her and she shall bear upon my knees that i may also have children by her
and she gave him bilhah her handmaid to wife and jacob went in unto her
and bilhah conceived and bare jacob a son
and rachel said god hath judged me and hath also heard my voice and hath given me a son therefore called she his name dan
and bilhah rachel's maid conceived again and bare jacob a second son
and rachel said with great wrestlings have i wrestled with my sister and i have prevailed and she called his name naphtali
when leah saw that she had left bearing she took zilpah her maid and gave her jacob to wife
and zilpah leah's maid bare jacob a son
and leah said a troop cometh and she called his name gad
and zilpah leah's maid bare jacob a second son
and leah said happy am i for the daughters will call me blessed and she called his name asher
and reuben went in the days of wheat harvest and found mandrakes in the field and brought them unto his mother leah then rachel said to leah give me i pray thee of thy son's mandrakes
and she said unto her is it a small matter that thou hast taken my husband and wouldest thou take away my son's mandrakes also and rachel said therefore he shall lie with thee to night for thy son's mandrakes
and jacob came out of the field in the evening and leah went out to meet him and said thou must come in unto me for surely i have hired thee with my son's mandrakes and he lay with her that night
and god hearkened unto leah and she conceived and bare jacob the fifth son
and leah said god hath given me my hire because i have given my maiden to my husband and she called his name issachar
and leah conceived again and bare jacob the sixth son
and leah said god hath endued me with a good dowry now will my husband dwell with me because i have born him six sons and she called his name zebulun
and afterwards she bare a daughter and called her name dinah
and god remembered rachel and god hearkened to her and opened her womb
and she conceived and bare a son and said god hath taken away my reproach
and she called his name joseph and said the lord shall add to me another son
and it came to pass when rachel had born joseph that jacob said unto laban send me away that i may go unto mine own place and to my country
give me my wives and my children for whom i have served thee and let me go for thou knowest my service which i have done thee
and laban said unto him i pray thee if i have found favour in thine eyes tarry for i have learned by experience that the lord hath blessed me for thy sake
and he said appoint me thy wages and i will give it
and he said unto him thou knowest how i have served thee and how thy cattle was with me
for it was little which thou hadst before i came and it is now increased unto a multitude and the lord hath blessed thee since my coming and now when shall i provide for mine own house also
and he said what shall i give thee and jacob said thou shalt not give me any thing if thou wilt do this thing for me i will again feed and keep thy flock
i will pass through all thy flock to day removing from thence all the speckled and spotted cattle and all the brown cattle among the sheep and the spotted and speckled among the goats and of such shall be my hire
so shall my righteousness answer for me in time to come when it shall come for my hire before thy face every one that is not speckled and spotted among the goats and brown among the sheep that shall be counted stolen with me
and laban said behold i would it might be according to thy word
and he removed that day the he goats that were ringstraked and spotted and all the she goats that were speckled and spotted and every one that had some white in it and all the brown among the sheep and gave them into the hand of his sons
and he set three days journey betwixt himself and jacob and jacob fed the rest of laban's flocks
and jacob took him rods of green poplar and of the hazel and chestnut tree and pilled white strakes in them and made the white appear which was in the rods
and he set the rods which he had pilled before the flocks in the gutters in the watering troughs when the flocks came to drink that they should conceive when they came to drink
and the flocks conceived before the rods and brought forth cattle ringstraked speckled and spotted
and jacob did separate the lambs and set the faces of the flocks toward the ringstraked and all the brown in the flock of laban and he put his own flocks by themselves and put them not unto laban's cattle
and it came to pass whensoever the stronger cattle did conceive that jacob laid the rods before the eyes of the cattle in the gutters that they might conceive among the rods
but when the cattle were feeble he put them not in so the feebler were laban's and the stronger jacob's
and the man increased exceedingly and had much cattle and maidservants and menservants and camels and asses
and he heard the words of laban's sons saying jacob hath taken away all that was our father's and of that which was our father's hath he gotten all this glory
and jacob beheld the countenance of laban and behold it was not toward him as before
and the lord said unto jacob return unto the land of thy fathers and to thy kindred and i will be with thee
and jacob sent and called rachel and leah to the field unto his flock
and said unto them i see your father's countenance that it is not toward me as before but the god of my father hath been with me
and ye know that with all my power i have served your father
and your father hath deceived me and changed my wages ten times but god suffered him not to hurt me
if he said thus the speckled shall be thy wages then all the cattle bare speckled and if he said thus the ringstraked shall be thy hire then bare all the cattle ringstraked
thus god hath taken away the cattle of your father and given them to me
and it came to pass at the time that the cattle conceived that i lifted up mine eyes and saw in a dream and behold the rams which leaped upon the cattle were ringstraked speckled and grisled
and the angel of god spake unto me in a dream saying jacob and i said here am i
and he said lift up now thine eyes and see all the rams which leap upon the cattle are ringstraked speckled and grisled for i have seen all that laban doeth unto thee
i am the god of bethel where thou anointedst the pillar and where thou vowedst a vow unto me now arise get thee out from this land and return unto the land of thy kindred
and rachel and leah answered and said unto him is there yet any portion or inheritance for us in our father's house
are we not counted of him strangers for he hath sold us and hath quite devoured also our money
for all the riches which god hath taken from our father that is ours and our children's now then whatsoever god hath said unto thee do
then jacob rose up and set his sons and his wives upon camels
and he carried away all his cattle and all his goods which he had gotten the cattle of his getting which he had gotten in padanaram for to go to isaac his father in the land of canaan
and laban went to shear his sheep and rachel had stolen the images that were her father's
and jacob stole away unawares to laban the syrian in that he told him not that he fled
so he fled with all that he had and he rose up and passed over the river and set his face toward the mount gilead
and it was told laban on the third day that jacob was fled
and he took his brethren with him and pursued after him seven days journey and they overtook him in the mount gilead
and god came to laban the syrian in a dream by night and said unto him take heed that thou speak not to jacob either good or bad
then laban overtook jacob now jacob had pitched his tent in the mount and laban with his brethren pitched in the mount of gilead
and laban said to jacob what hast thou done that thou hast stolen away unawares to me and carried away my daughters as captives taken with the sword
wherefore didst thou flee away secretly and steal away from me and didst not tell me that i might have sent thee away with mirth and with songs with tabret and with harp
and hast not suffered me to kiss my sons and my daughters thou hast now done foolishly in so doing
it is in the power of my hand to do you hurt but the god of your father spake unto me yesternight saying take thou heed that thou speak not to jacob either good or bad
and now though thou wouldest needs be gone because thou sore longedst after thy father's house yet wherefore hast thou stolen my gods
and jacob answered and said to laban because i was afraid for i said peradventure thou wouldest take by force thy daughters from me
with whomsoever thou findest thy gods let him not live before our brethren discern thou what is thine with me and take it to thee for jacob knew not that rachel had stolen them
and laban went into jacob's tent and into leah's tent and into the two maidservants tents but he found them not then went he out of leah's tent and entered into rachel's tent
now rachel had taken the images and put them in the camel's furniture and sat upon them and laban searched all the tent but found them not
and she said to her father let it not displease my lord that i cannot rise up before thee for the custom of women is upon me and he searched but found not the images
and jacob was wroth and chode with laban and jacob answered and said to laban what is my trespass what is my sin that thou hast so hotly pursued after me
whereas thou hast searched all my stuff what hast thou found of all thy household stuff set it here before my brethren and thy brethren that they may judge betwixt us both
this twenty years have i been with thee thy ewes and thy she goats have not cast their young and the rams of thy flock have i not eaten
that which was torn of beasts i brought not unto thee i bare the loss of it of my hand didst thou require it whether stolen by day or stolen by night
thus i was in the day the drought consumed me and the frost by night and my sleep departed from mine eyes
thus have i been twenty years in thy house i served thee fourteen years for thy two daughters and six years for thy cattle and thou hast changed my wages ten times
except the god of my father the god of abraham and the fear of isaac had been with me surely thou hadst sent me away now empty god hath seen mine affliction and the labour of my hands and rebuked thee yesternight
and laban answered and said unto jacob these daughters are my daughters and these children are my children and these cattle are my cattle and all that thou seest is mine and what can i do this day unto these my daughters or unto their children which they have born
now therefore come thou let us make a covenant i and thou and let it be for a witness between me and thee
and jacob took a stone and set it up for a pillar
and jacob said unto his brethren gather stones and they took stones and made an heap and they did eat there upon the heap
and laban called it jegarsahadutha but jacob called it galeed
and laban said this heap is a witness between me and thee this day therefore was the name of it called galeed
and mizpah for he said the lord watch between me and thee when we are absent one from another
if thou shalt afflict my daughters or if thou shalt take other wives beside my daughters no man is with us see god is witness betwixt me and thee
and laban said to jacob behold this heap and behold this pillar which i have cast betwixt me and thee
this heap be witness and this pillar be witness that i will not pass over this heap to thee and that thou shalt not pass over this heap and this pillar unto me for harm
the god of abraham and the god of nahor the god of their father judge betwixt us and jacob sware by the fear of his father isaac
then jacob offered sacrifice upon the mount and called his brethren to eat bread and they did eat bread and tarried all night in the mount
and early in the morning laban rose up and kissed his sons and his daughters and blessed them and laban departed and returned unto his place
and jacob went on his way and the angels of god met him
and when jacob saw them he said this is god's host and he called the name of that place mahanaim
and jacob sent messengers before him to esau his brother unto the land of seir the country of edom
and he commanded them saying thus shall ye speak unto my lord esau thy servant jacob saith thus i have sojourned with laban and stayed there until now
and i have oxen and asses flocks and menservants and womenservants and i have sent to tell my lord that i may find grace in thy sight
and the messengers returned to jacob saying we came to thy brother esau and also he cometh to meet thee and four hundred men with him
then jacob was greatly afraid and distressed and he divided the people that was with him and the flocks and herds and the camels into two bands
and said if esau come to the one company and smite it then the other company which is left shall escape
and jacob said o god of my father abraham and god of my father isaac the lord which saidst unto me return unto thy country and to thy kindred and i will deal well with thee
i am not worthy of the least of all the mercies and of all the truth which thou hast shewed unto thy servant for with my staff i passed over this jordan and now i am become two bands
deliver me i pray thee from the hand of my brother from the hand of esau for i fear him lest he will come and smite me and the mother with the children
and thou saidst i will surely do thee good and make thy seed as the sand of the sea which cannot be numbered for multitude
and he lodged there that same night and took of that which came to his hand a present for esau his brother
two hundred she goats and twenty he goats two hundred ewes and twenty rams
thirty milch camels with their colts forty kine and ten bulls twenty she asses and ten foals
and he delivered them into the hand of his servants every drove by themselves and said unto his servants pass over before me and put a space betwixt drove and drove
and he commanded the foremost saying when esau my brother meeteth thee and asketh thee saying whose art thou and whither goest thou and whose are these before thee
then thou shalt say they be thy servant jacob's it is a present sent unto my lord esau and behold also he is behind us
and so commanded he the second and the third and all that followed the droves saying on this manner shall ye speak unto esau when ye find him
and say ye moreover behold thy servant jacob is behind us for he said i will appease him with the present that goeth before me and afterward i will see his face peradventure he will accept of me
so went the present over before him and himself lodged that night in the company
and he rose up that night and took his two wives and his two womenservants and his eleven sons and passed over the ford jabbok
and he took them and sent them over the brook and sent over that he had
and jacob was left alone and there wrestled a man with him until the breaking of the day
and when he saw that he prevailed not against him he touched the hollow of his thigh and the hollow of jacob's thigh was out of joint as he wrestled with him
and he said let me go for the day breaketh and he said i will not let thee go except thou bless me
and he said unto him what is thy name and he said jacob
and he said thy name shall be called no more jacob but israel for as a prince hast thou power with god and with men and hast prevailed
and jacob asked him and said tell me i pray thee thy name and he said wherefore is it that thou dost ask after my name and he blessed him there
and jacob called the name of the place peniel for i have seen god face to face and my life is preserved
and as he passed over penuel the sun rose upon him and he halted upon his thigh
therefore the children of israel eat not of the sinew which shrank which is upon the hollow of the thigh unto this day because he touched the hollow of jacob's thigh in the sinew that shrank
and jacob lifted up his eyes and looked and behold esau came and with him four hundred men and he divided the children unto leah and unto rachel and unto the two handmaids
and he put the handmaids and their children foremost and leah and her children after and rachel and joseph hindermost
and he passed over before them and bowed himself to the ground seven times until he came near to his brother
and esau ran to meet him and embraced him and fell on his neck and kissed him and they wept
and he lifted up his eyes and saw the women and the children and said who are those with thee and he said the children which god hath graciously given thy servant
then the handmaidens came near they and their children and they bowed themselves
and leah also with her children came near and bowed themselves and after came joseph near and rachel and they bowed themselves
and he said what meanest thou by all this drove which i met and he said these are to find grace in the sight of my lord
and esau said i have enough my brother keep that thou hast unto thyself
and jacob said nay i pray thee if now i have found grace in thy sight then receive my present at my hand for therefore i have seen thy face as though i had seen the face of god and thou wast pleased with me
take i pray thee my blessing that is brought to thee because god hath dealt graciously with me and because i have enough and he urged him and he took it
and he said let us take our journey and let us go and i will go before thee
and he said unto him my lord knoweth that the children are tender and the flocks and herds with young are with me and if men should overdrive them one day all the flock will die
let my lord i pray thee pass over before his servant and i will lead on softly according as the cattle that goeth before me and the children be able to endure until i come unto my lord unto seir
and esau said let me now leave with thee some of the folk that are with me and he said what needeth it let me find grace in the sight of my lord
so esau returned that day on his way unto seir
and jacob journeyed to succoth and built him an house and made booths for his cattle therefore the name of the place is called succoth
and jacob came to shalem a city of shechem which is in the land of canaan when he came from padanaram and pitched his tent before the city
and he bought a parcel of a field where he had spread his tent at the hand of the children of hamor shechem's father for an hundred pieces of money
and he erected there an altar and called it eleloheisrael
and dinah the daughter of leah which she bare unto jacob went out to see the daughters of the land
and when shechem the son of hamor the hivite prince of the country saw her he took her and lay with her and defiled her
and his soul clave unto dinah the daughter of jacob and he loved the damsel and spake kindly unto the damsel
and shechem spake unto his father hamor saying get me this damsel to wife
and jacob heard that he had defiled dinah his daughter now his sons were with his cattle in the field and jacob held his peace until they were come
and hamor the father of shechem went out unto jacob to commune with him
and the sons of jacob came out of the field when they heard it and the men were grieved and they were very wroth because he had wrought folly in israel in lying with jacob's daughter which thing ought not to be done
and hamor communed with them saying the soul of my son shechem longeth for your daughter i pray you give her him to wife
and make ye marriages with us and give your daughters unto us and take our daughters unto you
and ye shall dwell with us and the land shall be before you dwell and trade ye therein and get you possessions therein
and shechem said unto her father and unto her brethren let me find grace in your eyes and what ye shall say unto me i will give
ask me never so much dowry and gift and i will give according as ye shall say unto me but give me the damsel to wife
and the sons of jacob answered shechem and hamor his father deceitfully and said because he had defiled dinah their sister
and they said unto them we cannot do this thing to give our sister to one that is uncircumcised for that were a reproach unto us
but in this will we consent unto you if ye will be as we be that every male of you be circumcised
then will we give our daughters unto you and we will take your daughters to us and we will dwell with you and we will become one people
but if ye will not hearken unto us to be circumcised then will we take our daughter and we will be gone
