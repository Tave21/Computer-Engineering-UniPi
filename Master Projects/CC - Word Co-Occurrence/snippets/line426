 matchless navarre the plea of no less weight
 than aquitaine a dowry for a queen
 be now as prodigal of all dear grace
 as nature was in making graces dear
 when she did starve the general world beside
 and prodigally gave them all to you
princess good lord boyet my beauty though but mean
 needs not the painted flourish of your praise
 beauty is bought by judgement of the eye
 not utter'd by base sale of chapmen's tongues
 i am less proud to hear you tell my worth
 than you much willing to be counted wise
 in spending your wit in the praise of mine
 but now to task the tasker good boyet
 you are not ignorant alltelling fame
 doth noise abroad navarre hath made a vow
 till painful study shall outwear three years
 no woman may approach his silent court
 therefore to's seemeth it a needful course
 before we enter his forbidden gates
 to know his pleasure and in that behalf
 bold of your worthiness we single you
 as our bestmoving fair solicitor
 tell him the daughter of the king of france
 on serious business craving quick dispatch
 importunes personal conference with his grace
 haste signify so much while we attend
 like humblevisaged suitors his high will
boyet proud of employment willingly i go
princess all pride is willing pride and yours is so
 exit boyet
 who are the votaries my loving lords
 that are vowfellows with this virtuous duke
first lord lord longaville is one
princess know you the man
maria i know him madam at a marriagefeast
 between lord perigort and the beauteous heir
 of jaques falconbridge solemnized
 in normandy saw i this longaville
 a man of sovereign parts he is esteem'd
 well fitted in arts glorious in arms
 nothing becomes him ill that he would well
 the only soil of his fair virtue's gloss
 if virtue's gloss will stain with any soil
 is a sharp wit matched with too blunt a will
 whose edge hath power to cut whose will still wills
 it should none spare that come within his power
princess some merry mocking lord belike is't so
maria they say so most that most his humours know
princess such shortlived wits do wither as they grow
 who are the rest
katharine the young dumain a wellaccomplished youth
 of all that virtue love for virtue loved
 most power to do most harm least knowing ill
 for he hath wit to make an ill shape good
 and shape to win grace though he had no wit
 i saw him at the duke alencon's once
 and much too little of that good i saw
 is my report to his great worthiness
rosaline another of these students at that time
 was there with him if i have heard a truth
 biron they call him but a merrier man
 within the limit of becoming mirth
 i never spent an hour's talk withal
 his eye begets occasion for his wit
 for every object that the one doth catch
 the other turns to a mirthmoving jest
 which his fair tongue conceit's expositor
 delivers in such apt and gracious words
 that aged ears play truant at his tales
 and younger hearings are quite ravished
 so sweet and voluble is his discourse
princess god bless my ladies are they all in love
 that every one her own hath garnished
 with such bedecking ornaments of praise
first lord here comes boyet
 reenter boyet
princess now what admittance lord
boyet navarre had notice of your fair approach
 and he and his competitors in oath
 were all address'd to meet you gentle lady
 before i came marry thus much i have learnt
 he rather means to lodge you in the field
 like one that comes here to besiege his court
 than seek a dispensation for his oath
 to let you enter his unpeopled house
 here comes navarre
 enter ferdinand longaville dumain biron and
 attendants
ferdinand fair princess welcome to the court of navarre
princess fair i give you back again and welcome i have
 not yet the roof of this court is too high to be
 yours and welcome to the wide fields too base to be mine
ferdinand you shall be welcome madam to my court
princess i will be welcome then conduct me thither
ferdinand hear me dear lady i have sworn an oath
princess our lady help my lord he'll be forsworn
ferdinand not for the world fair madam by my will
princess why will shall break it will and nothing else
ferdinand your ladyship is ignorant what it is
princess were my lord so his ignorance were wise
 where now his knowledge must prove ignorance
 i hear your grace hath sworn out housekeeping
 tis deadly sin to keep that oath my lord
 and sin to break it
 but pardon me i am too suddenbold
 to teach a teacher ill beseemeth me
 vouchsafe to read the purpose of my coming
 and suddenly resolve me in my suit
ferdinand madam i will if suddenly i may
princess you will the sooner that i were away
 for you'll prove perjured if you make me stay
biron did not i dance with you in brabant once
rosaline did not i dance with you in brabant once
biron i know you did
rosaline how needless was it then to ask the question
biron you must not be so quick
rosaline tis long of you that spur me with such questions
biron your wit's too hot it speeds too fast twill tire
rosaline not till it leave the rider in the mire
biron what time o day
rosaline the hour that fools should ask
biron now fair befall your mask
rosaline fair fall the face it covers
biron and send you many lovers
rosaline amen so you be none
biron nay then will i be gone
ferdinand madam your father here doth intimate
 the payment of a hundred thousand crowns
 being but the one half of an entire sum
 disbursed by my father in his wars
 but say that he or we as neither have
 received that sum yet there remains unpaid
 a hundred thousand more in surety of the which
 one part of aquitaine is bound to us
 although not valued to the money's worth
 if then the king your father will restore
 but that one half which is unsatisfied
 we will give up our right in aquitaine
 and hold fair friendship with his majesty
 but that it seems he little purposeth
 for here he doth demand to have repaid
 a hundred thousand crowns and not demands
 on payment of a hundred thousand crowns
 to have his title live in aquitaine
 which we much rather had depart withal
 and have the money by our father lent
 than aquitaine so gelded as it is
 dear princess were not his requests so far
 from reason's yielding your fair self should make
 a yielding gainst some reason in my breast
 and go well satisfied to france again
princess you do the king my father too much wrong
 and wrong the reputation of your name
 in so unseeming to confess receipt
 of that which hath so faithfully been paid
ferdinand i do protest i never heard of it
 and if you prove it i'll repay it back
 or yield up aquitaine
princess we arrest your word
 boyet you can produce acquittances
 for such a sum from special officers
 of charles his father
ferdinand satisfy me so
boyet so please your grace the packet is not come
 where that and other specialties are bound
 tomorrow you shall have a sight of them
ferdinand it shall suffice me at which interview
 all liberal reason i will yield unto
 meantime receive such welcome at my hand
 as honour without breach of honour may
 make tender of to thy true worthiness
 you may not come fair princess in my gates
 but here without you shall be so received
 as you shall deem yourself lodged in my heart
 though so denied fair harbour in my house
 your own good thoughts excuse me and farewell
 tomorrow shall we visit you again
princess sweet health and fair desires consort your grace
ferdinand thy own wish wish i thee in every place
 exit
biron lady i will commend you to mine own heart
rosaline pray you do my commendations i would be glad to see it
biron i would you heard it groan
rosaline is the fool sick
biron sick at the heart
rosaline alack let it blood
biron would that do it good
rosaline my physic says ay'
biron will you prick't with your eye
rosaline no point with my knife
biron now god save thy life
rosaline and yours from long living
biron i cannot stay thanksgiving
 retiring
dumain sir i pray you a word what lady is that same
boyet the heir of alencon katharine her name
dumain a gallant lady monsieur fare you well
 exit
longaville i beseech you a word what is she in the white
