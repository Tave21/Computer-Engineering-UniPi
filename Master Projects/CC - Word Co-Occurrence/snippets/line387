 why what means this why do you look on me
 i see no more in you than in the ordinary
 of nature's salework od's my little life
 i think she means to tangle my eyes too
 no faith proud mistress hope not after it
 tis not your inky brows your black silk hair
 your bugle eyeballs nor your cheek of cream
 that can entame my spirits to your worship
 you foolish shepherd wherefore do you follow her
 like foggy south puffing with wind and rain
 you are a thousand times a properer man
 than she a woman tis such fools as you
 that makes the world full of illfavour'd children
 tis not her glass but you that flatters her
 and out of you she sees herself more proper
 than any of her lineaments can show her
 but mistress know yourself down on your knees
 and thank heaven fasting for a good man's love
 for i must tell you friendly in your ear
 sell when you can you are not for all markets
 cry the man mercy love him take his offer
 foul is most foul being foul to be a scoffer
 so take her to thee shepherd fare you well
phebe sweet youth i pray you chide a year together
 i had rather hear you chide than this man woo
rosalind he's fallen in love with your foulness and she'll
 fall in love with my anger if it be so as fast as
 she answers thee with frowning looks i'll sauce her
 with bitter words why look you so upon me
phebe for no ill will i bear you
rosalind i pray you do not fall in love with me
 for i am falser than vows made in wine
 besides i like you not if you will know my house
 tis at the tuft of olives here hard by
 will you go sister shepherd ply her hard
 come sister shepherdess look on him better
 and be not proud though all the world could see
 none could be so abused in sight as he
 come to our flock
 exeunt rosalind celia and corin
phebe dead shepherd now i find thy saw of might
 who ever loved that loved not at first sight'
silvius sweet phebe
phebe ha what say'st thou silvius
silvius sweet phebe pity me
phebe why i am sorry for thee gentle silvius
silvius wherever sorrow is relief would be
 if you do sorrow at my grief in love
 by giving love your sorrow and my grief
 were both extermined
phebe thou hast my love is not that neighbourly
silvius i would have you
phebe why that were covetousness
 silvius the time was that i hated thee
 and yet it is not that i bear thee love
 but since that thou canst talk of love so well
 thy company which erst was irksome to me
 i will endure and i'll employ thee too
 but do not look for further recompense
 than thine own gladness that thou art employ'd
silvius so holy and so perfect is my love
 and i in such a poverty of grace
 that i shall think it a most plenteous crop
 to glean the broken ears after the man
 that the main harvest reaps loose now and then
 a scatter'd smile and that i'll live upon
phebe know'st now the youth that spoke to me erewhile
silvius not very well but i have met him oft
 and he hath bought the cottage and the bounds
 that the old carlot once was master of
phebe think not i love him though i ask for him
 tis but a peevish boy yet he talks well
 but what care i for words yet words do well
 when he that speaks them pleases those that hear
 it is a pretty youth not very pretty
 but sure he's proud and yet his pride becomes him
 he'll make a proper man the best thing in him
 is his complexion and faster than his tongue
 did make offence his eye did heal it up
 he is not very tall yet for his years he's tall
 his leg is but so so and yet tis well
 there was a pretty redness in his lip
 a little riper and more lusty red
 than that mix'd in his cheek twas just the difference
 between the constant red and mingled damask
 there be some women silvius had they mark'd him
 in parcels as i did would have gone near
 to fall in love with him but for my part
 i love him not nor hate him not and yet
 i have more cause to hate him than to love him
 for what had he to do to chide at me
 he said mine eyes were black and my hair black
 and now i am remember'd scorn'd at me
 i marvel why i answer'd not again
 but that's all one omittance is no quittance
 i'll write to him a very taunting letter
 and thou shalt bear it wilt thou silvius
silvius phebe with all my heart
phebe i'll write it straight
 the matter's in my head and in my heart
 i will be bitter with him and passing short
 go with me silvius
 exeunt
 as you like it
act iv
scene i the forest
 enter rosalind celia and jaques
jaques i prithee pretty youth let me be better acquainted
 with thee
rosalind they say you are a melancholy fellow
jaques i am so i do love it better than laughing
rosalind those that are in extremity of either are abominable
 fellows and betray themselves to every modern
 censure worse than drunkards
jaques why tis good to be sad and say nothing
rosalind why then tis good to be a post
jaques i have neither the scholar's melancholy which is
 emulation nor the musician's which is fantastical
 nor the courtier's which is proud nor the
 soldier's which is ambitious nor the lawyer's
 which is politic nor the lady's which is nice nor
 the lover's which is all these but it is a
 melancholy of mine own compounded of many simples
 extracted from many objects and indeed the sundry's
 contemplation of my travels in which my often
 rumination wraps me m a most humorous sadness
rosalind a traveller by my faith you have great reason to
 be sad i fear you have sold your own lands to see
 other men's then to have seen much and to have
 nothing is to have rich eyes and poor hands
jaques yes i have gained my experience
rosalind and your experience makes you sad i had rather have
 a fool to make me merry than experience to make me
 sad and to travel for it too
 enter orlando
orlando good day and happiness dear rosalind
jaques nay then god be wi you an you talk in blank verse
 exit
rosalind farewell monsieur traveller look you lisp and
 wear strange suits disable all the benefits of your
 own country be out of love with your nativity and
 almost chide god for making you that countenance you
 are or i will scarce think you have swam in a
 gondola why how now orlando where have you been
 all this while you a lover an you serve me such
 another trick never come in my sight more
orlando my fair rosalind i come within an hour of my promise
rosalind break an hour's promise in love he that will
 divide a minute into a thousand parts and break but
 a part of the thousandth part of a minute in the
 affairs of love it may be said of him that cupid
 hath clapped him o the shoulder but i'll warrant
 him heartwhole
orlando pardon me dear rosalind
rosalind nay an you be so tardy come no more in my sight i
 had as lief be wooed of a snail
orlando of a snail
rosalind ay of a snail for though he comes slowly he
 carries his house on his head a better jointure
 i think than you make a woman besides he brings
 his destiny with him
orlando what's that
rosalind why horns which such as you are fain to be
 beholding to your wives for but he comes armed in
 his fortune and prevents the slander of his wife
orlando virtue is no hornmaker and my rosalind is virtuous
rosalind and i am your rosalind
celia it pleases him to call you so but he hath a
 rosalind of a better leer than you
rosalind come woo me woo me for now i am in a holiday
 humour and like enough to consent what would you
 say to me now an i were your very very rosalind
orlando i would kiss before i spoke
rosalind nay you were better speak first and when you were
 gravelled for lack of matter you might take
 occasion to kiss very good orators when they are
 out they will spit and for lovers lackinggod
 warn usmatter the cleanliest shift is to kiss
orlando how if the kiss be denied
rosalind then she puts you to entreaty and there begins new matter
orlando who could be out being before his beloved mistress
rosalind marry that should you if i were your mistress or
 i should think my honesty ranker than my wit
orlando what of my suit
rosalind not out of your apparel and yet out of your suit
 am not i your rosalind
orlando i take some joy to say you are because i would be
 talking of her
rosalind well in her person i say i will not have you
orlando then in mine own person i die
rosalind no faith die by attorney the poor world is
 almost six thousand years old and in all this time
 there was not any man died in his own person
 videlicit in a lovecause troilus had his brains
 dashed out with a grecian club yet he did what he
 could to die before and he is one of the patterns
 of love leander he would have lived many a fair
 year though hero had turned nun if it had not been
 for a hot midsummer night for good youth he went
 but forth to wash him in the hellespont and being
