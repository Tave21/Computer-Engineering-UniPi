 enter adriana and luciana
adriana ah luciana did he tempt thee so
 mightst thou perceive austerely in his eye
 that he did plead in earnest yea or no
 look'd he or red or pale or sad or merrily
 what observation madest thou in this case
 of his heart's meteors tilting in his face
luciana first he denied you had in him no right
adriana he meant he did me none the more my spite
luciana then swore he that he was a stranger here
adriana and true he swore though yet forsworn he were
luciana then pleaded i for you
adriana and what said he
luciana that love i begg'd for you he begg'd of me
adriana with what persuasion did he tempt thy love
luciana with words that in an honest suit might move
 first he did praise my beauty then my speech
adriana didst speak him fair
luciana have patience i beseech
adriana i cannot nor i will not hold me still
 my tongue though not my heart shall have his will
 he is deformed crooked old and sere
 illfaced worse bodied shapeless everywhere
 vicious ungentle foolish blunt unkind
 stigmatical in making worse in mind
luciana who would be jealous then of such a one
 no evil lost is wail'd when it is gone
adriana ah but i think him better than i say
 and yet would herein others eyes were worse
 far from her nest the lapwing cries away
 my heart prays for him though my tongue do curse

 one whose hard heart is button'd up with steel
 a fiend a fury pitiless and rough
 a wolf nay worse a fellow all in buff
 a backfriend a shoulderclapper one that
 countermands
 the passages of alleys creeks and narrow lands
 a hound that runs counter and yet draws dryfoot well
 one that before the judgement carries poor souls to hell
adriana why man what is the matter
dromio of syracuse i do not know the matter he is rested on the case

 worth to season

 reenter luciana with a purse
