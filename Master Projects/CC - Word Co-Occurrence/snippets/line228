scene i a house in rome
 antony octavius and lepidus seated at a table
antony these many then shall die their names are prick'd
octavius your brother too must die consent you lepidus
lepidus i do consent
octavius prick him down antony
lepidus upon condition publius shall not live
 who is your sister's son mark antony
antony he shall not live look with a spot i damn him
 but lepidus go you to caesar's house
 fetch the will hither and we shall determine
 how to cut off some charge in legacies
lepidus what shall i find you here
octavius or here or at the capitol
 exit lepidus
antony this is a slight unmeritable man
 meet to be sent on errands is it fit
 the threefold world divided he should stand
 one of the three to share it
octavius so you thought him
 and took his voice who should be prick'd to die
 in our black sentence and proscription
antony octavius i have seen more days than you
 and though we lay these honours on this man
 to ease ourselves of divers slanderous loads
 he shall but bear them as the ass bears gold
 to groan and sweat under the business
 either led or driven as we point the way
 and having brought our treasure where we will
 then take we down his load and turn him off
 like to the empty ass to shake his ears
 and graze in commons
octavius you may do your will
 but he's a tried and valiant soldier
antony so is my horse octavius and for that
 i do appoint him store of provender
 it is a creature that i teach to fight
 to wind to stop to run directly on
 his corporal motion govern'd by my spirit
 and in some taste is lepidus but so
 he must be taught and train'd and bid go forth
 a barrenspirited fellow one that feeds
 on abjects orts and imitations
 which out of use and staled by other men
 begin his fashion do not talk of him
 but as a property and now octavius
 listen great thingsbrutus and cassius
 are levying powers we must straight make head
 therefore let our alliance be combined
 our best friends made our means stretch'd
 and let us presently go sit in council
 how covert matters may be best disclosed
 and open perils surest answered
octavius let us do so for we are at the stake
 and bay'd about with many enemies
 and some that smile have in their hearts i fear
 millions of mischiefs

scene ii camp near sardis before brutus's tent
 drum enter brutus lucilius lucius and
 soldiers titinius and pindarus meeting them
brutus stand ho
lucilius give the word ho and stand
brutus what now lucilius is cassius near
lucilius he is at hand and pindarus is come
 to do you salutation from his master
brutus he greets me well your master pindarus
 in his own change or by ill officers
 hath given me some worthy cause to wish
 things done undone but if he be at hand
 i shall be satisfied
pindarus i do not doubt
 but that my noble master will appear
 such as he is full of regard and honour
brutus he is not doubted a word lucilius
 how he received you let me be resolved
lucilius with courtesy and with respect enough
 but not with such familiar instances
 nor with such free and friendly conference
 as he hath used of old
brutus thou hast described
 a hot friend cooling ever note lucilius
 when love begins to sicken and decay
 it useth an enforced ceremony
 there are no tricks in plain and simple faith
 but hollow men like horses hot at hand
 make gallant show and promise of their mettle
 but when they should endure the bloody spur
 they fall their crests and like deceitful jades
 sink in the trial comes his army on
lucilius they mean this night in sardis to be quarter'd
 the greater part the horse in general
 are come with cassius
brutus hark he is arrived
 low march within
 march gently on to meet him
 enter cassius and his powers
cassius stand ho
brutus stand ho speak the word along
first soldier stand
second soldier stand
third soldier stand
cassius most noble brother you have done me wrong
brutus judge me you gods wrong i mine enemies
 and if not so how should i wrong a brother
cassius brutus this sober form of yours hides wrongs
 and when you do them
brutus cassius be content
 speak your griefs softly i do know you well
 before the eyes of both our armies here
 which should perceive nothing but love from us
 let us not wrangle bid them move away
 then in my tent cassius enlarge your griefs
 and i will give you audience
cassius pindarus
 bid our commanders lead their charges off
 a little from this ground
brutus lucilius do you the like and let no man
 come to our tent till we have done our conference
 let lucius and titinius guard our door

scene iii brutus's tent
 enter brutus and cassius
cassius that you have wrong'd me doth appear in this
 you have condemn'd and noted lucius pella
 for taking bribes here of the sardians
 wherein my letters praying on his side
 because i knew the man were slighted off
brutus you wronged yourself to write in such a case
cassius in such a time as this it is not meet
 that every nice offence should bear his comment
