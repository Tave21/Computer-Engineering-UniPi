 again and flourish with the highest therefore
 tis not amiss we tender our loves to him in this
 supposed distress of his it will show honestly in
 us and is very likely to load our purposes with
 what they travail for if it be a just true report
 that goes of his having
poet what have you now to present unto him
painter nothing at this time but my visitation only i will
 promise him an excellent piece
poet i must serve him so too tell him of an intent
 that's coming toward him
painter good as the best promising is the very air o the
 time it opens the eyes of expectation
 performance is ever the duller for his act and
 but in the plainer and simpler kind of people the
 deed of saying is quite out of use to promise is
 most courtly and fashionable performance is a kind
 of will or testament which argues a great sickness
 in his judgment that makes it
 timon comes from his cave behind
timon aside excellent workman thou canst not paint a
 man so bad as is thyself
poet i am thinking what i shall say i have provided for
 him it must be a personating of himself a satire
 against the softness of prosperity with a discovery
 of the infinite flatteries that follow youth and opulency
timon aside must thou needs stand for a villain in
 thine own work wilt thou whip thine own faults in
 other men do so i have gold for thee
poet nay let's seek him
 then do we sin against our own estate
 when we may profit meet and come too late
painter true
 when the day serves before blackcorner'd night
 find what thou want'st by free and offer'd light come
timon aside i'll meet you at the turn what a
 god's gold
 that he is worshipp'd in a baser temple
 than where swine feed
 tis thou that rigg'st the bark and plough'st the foam
 settlest admired reverence in a slave
 to thee be worship and thy saints for aye
 be crown'd with plagues that thee alone obey
 fit i meet them
 coming forward
poet hail worthy timon
painter our late noble master
timon have i once lived to see two honest men
poet sir
 having often of your open bounty tasted
 hearing you were retired your friends fall'n off
 whose thankless natureso abhorred spirits
 not all the whips of heaven are large enough
 what to you
 whose starlike nobleness gave life and influence
 to their whole being i am rapt and cannot cover
 the monstrous bulk of this ingratitude
 with any size of words
timon let it go naked men may see't the better
 you that are honest by being what you are
 make them best seen and known
painter he and myself
 have travail'd in the great shower of your gifts
 and sweetly felt it
timon ay you are honest men
painter we are hither come to offer you our service
timon most honest men why how shall i requite you
 can you eat roots and drink cold water no
both what we can do we'll do to do you service
timon ye're honest men ye've heard that i have gold
 i am sure you have speak truth ye're honest men
painter so it is said my noble lord but therefore
 came not my friend nor i
timon good honest men thou draw'st a counterfeit
 best in all athens thou'rt indeed the best
 thou counterfeit'st most lively
painter so so my lord
timon e'en so sir as i say and for thy fiction
 why thy verse swells with stuff so fine and smooth
 that thou art even natural in thine art
 but for all this my honestnatured friends
 i must needs say you have a little fault
 marry tis not monstrous in you neither wish i
 you take much pains to mend
both beseech your honour
 to make it known to us
timon you'll take it ill
both most thankfully my lord
timon will you indeed
both doubt it not worthy lord
timon there's never a one of you but trusts a knave
 that mightily deceives you
both do we my lord
timon ay and you hear him cog see him dissemble
 know his gross patchery love him feed him
 keep in your bosom yet remain assured
 that he's a madeup villain
painter i know none such my lord
poet nor i
timon look you i love you well i'll give you gold
 rid me these villains from your companies
 hang them or stab them drown them in a draught
 confound them by some course and come to me
 i'll give you gold enough
both name them my lord let's know them
timon you that way and you this but two in company
 each man apart all single and alone
 yet an archvillain keeps him company
 if where thou art two villains shall not be
 come not near him if thou wouldst not reside
 but where one villain is then him abandon
 hence pack there's gold you came for gold ye slaves
 to painter
 you have work'd for me there's payment for you hence
 to poet
 you are an alchemist make gold of that
 out rascal dogs
 beats them out and then retires to his cave
 enter flavius and two senators
flavius it is in vain that you would speak with timon
 for he is set so only to himself
 that nothing but himself which looks like man
 is friendly with him
first senator bring us to his cave
 it is our part and promise to the athenians
 to speak with timon
second senator at all times alike
 men are not still the same twas time and griefs
 that framed him thus time with his fairer hand
 offering the fortunes of his former days
 the former man may make him bring us to him
 and chance it as it may
flavius here is his cave
 peace and content be here lord timon timon
 look out and speak to friends the athenians
 by two of their most reverend senate greet thee
 speak to them noble timon
 timon comes from his cave
timon thou sun that comfort'st burn speak and
 be hang'd
 for each true word a blister and each false
 be as cauterizing to the root o the tongue
 consuming it with speaking
first senator worthy timon
timon of none but such as you and you of timon
first senator the senators of athens greet thee timon
timon i thank them and would send them back the plague
 could i but catch it for them
first senator o forget
 what we are sorry for ourselves in thee
 the senators with one consent of love
 entreat thee back to athens who have thought
 on special dignities which vacant lie
 for thy best use and wearing
second senator they confess
 toward thee forgetfulness too general gross
 which now the public body which doth seldom
 play the recanter feeling in itself
 a lack of timon's aid hath sense withal
 of its own fail restraining aid to timon
 and send forth us to make their sorrow'd render
 together with a recompense more fruitful
 than their offence can weigh down by the dram
 ay even such heaps and sums of love and wealth
 as shall to thee blot out what wrongs were theirs
 and write in thee the figures of their love
 ever to read them thine
timon you witch me in it
 surprise me to the very brink of tears
 lend me a fool's heart and a woman's eyes
 and i'll beweep these comforts worthy senators
first senator therefore so please thee to return with us
 and of our athens thine and ours to take
 the captainship thou shalt be met with thanks
 allow'd with absolute power and thy good name
 live with authority so soon we shall drive back
 of alcibiades the approaches wild
 who like a boar too savage doth root up
 his country's peace
second senator and shakes his threatening sword
 against the walls of athens
first senator therefore timon
timon well sir i will therefore i will sir thus
 if alcibiades kill my countrymen
 let alcibiades know this of timon
 that timon cares not but if be sack fair athens
 and take our goodly aged men by the beards
 giving our holy virgins to the stain
 of contumelious beastly madbrain'd war
 then let him know and tell him timon speaks it
 in pity of our aged and our youth
 i cannot choose but tell him that i care not
 and let him take't at worst for their knives care not
 while you have throats to answer for myself
 there's not a whittle in the unruly camp
 but i do prize it at my love before
 the reverend'st throat in athens so i leave you
 to the protection of the prosperous gods
 as thieves to keepers
flavius stay not all's in vain
