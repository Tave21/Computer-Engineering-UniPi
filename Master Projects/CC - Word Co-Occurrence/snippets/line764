 let me put in your minds if you forget
 what you have been ere now and what you are
 withal what i have been and what i am
queen margaret a murderous villain and so still thou art
gloucester poor clarence did forsake his father warwick
 yea and forswore himselfwhich jesu pardon
queen margaret which god revenge
gloucester to fight on edward's party for the crown
 and for his meed poor lord he is mew'd up
 i would to god my heart were flint like edward's
 or edward's soft and pitiful like mine
 i am too childishfoolish for this world
queen margaret hie thee to hell for shame and leave the world
 thou cacodemon there thy kingdom is
rivers my lord of gloucester in those busy days
 which here you urge to prove us enemies
 we follow'd then our lord our lawful king
 so should we you if you should be our king
gloucester if i should be i had rather be a pedlar
 far be it from my heart the thought of it
queen elizabeth as little joy my lord as you suppose
 you should enjoy were you this country's king
 as little joy may you suppose in me
 that i enjoy being the queen thereof
queen margaret a little joy enjoys the queen thereof
 for i am she and altogether joyless
 i can no longer hold me patient
 advancing
 hear me you wrangling pirates that fall out
 in sharing that which you have pill'd from me
 which of you trembles not that looks on me
 if not that i being queen you bow like subjects
 yet that by you deposed you quake like rebels
 o gentle villain do not turn away
gloucester foul wrinkled witch what makest thou in my sight
queen margaret but repetition of what thou hast marr'd
 that will i make before i let thee go
gloucester wert thou not banished on pain of death
queen margaret i was but i do find more pain in banishment
 than death can yield me here by my abode
 a husband and a son thou owest to me
 and thou a kingdom all of you allegiance
 the sorrow that i have by right is yours
 and all the pleasures you usurp are mine
gloucester the curse my noble father laid on thee
 when thou didst crown his warlike brows with paper
 and with thy scorns drew'st rivers from his eyes
 and then to dry them gavest the duke a clout
 steep'd in the faultless blood of pretty rutland
 his curses then from bitterness of soul
 denounced against thee are all fall'n upon thee
 and god not we hath plagued thy bloody deed
queen elizabeth so just is god to right the innocent
hastings o twas the foulest deed to slay that babe
 and the most merciless that e'er was heard of
rivers tyrants themselves wept when it was reported
dorset no man but prophesied revenge for it
buckingham northumberland then present wept to see it
queen margaret what were you snarling all before i came
 ready to catch each other by the throat
 and turn you all your hatred now on me
 did york's dread curse prevail so much with heaven
 that henry's death my lovely edward's death
 their kingdom's loss my woful banishment
 could all but answer for that peevish brat
 can curses pierce the clouds and enter heaven
 why then give way dull clouds to my quick curses
 if not by war by surfeit die your king
 as ours by murder to make him a king
 edward thy son which now is prince of wales
 for edward my son which was prince of wales
 die in his youth by like untimely violence
 thyself a queen for me that was a queen
 outlive thy glory like my wretched self
 long mayst thou live to wail thy children's loss
 and see another as i see thee now
 deck'd in thy rights as thou art stall'd in mine
 long die thy happy days before thy death
 and after many lengthen'd hours of grief
 die neither mother wife nor england's queen
 rivers and dorset you were standers by
 and so wast thou lord hastings when my son
 was stabb'd with bloody daggers god i pray him
 that none of you may live your natural age
 but by some unlook'd accident cut off
gloucester have done thy charm thou hateful wither'd hag
queen margaret and leave out thee stay dog for thou shalt hear me
 if heaven have any grievous plague in store
 exceeding those that i can wish upon thee
 o let them keep it till thy sins be ripe
 and then hurl down their indignation
 on thee the troubler of the poor world's peace
 the worm of conscience still begnaw thy soul
 thy friends suspect for traitors while thou livest
 and take deep traitors for thy dearest friends
 no sleep close up that deadly eye of thine
 unless it be whilst some tormenting dream
 affrights thee with a hell of ugly devils
 thou elvishmark'd abortive rooting hog
 thou that wast seal'd in thy nativity
 the slave of nature and the son of hell
 thou slander of thy mother's heavy womb
 thou loathed issue of thy father's loins
 thou rag of honour thou detested
gloucester margaret
queen margaret richard
gloucester ha
queen margaret i call thee not
gloucester i cry thee mercy then for i had thought
 that thou hadst call'd me all these bitter names
queen margaret why so i did but look'd for no reply
 o let me make the period to my curse
gloucester tis done by me and ends in margaret'
queen elizabeth thus have you breathed your curse against yourself
queen margaret poor painted queen vain flourish of my fortune
 why strew'st thou sugar on that bottled spider
 whose deadly web ensnareth thee about
 fool fool thou whet'st a knife to kill thyself
 the time will come when thou shalt wish for me
 to help thee curse that poisonous bunchback'd toad
hastings falseboding woman end thy frantic curse
 lest to thy harm thou move our patience
queen margaret foul shame upon you you have all moved mine
rivers were you well served you would be taught your duty
queen margaret to serve me well you all should do me duty
 teach me to be your queen and you my subjects
 o serve me well and teach yourselves that duty
dorset dispute not with her she is lunatic
queen margaret peace master marquess you are malapert
 your firenew stamp of honour is scarce current
 o that your young nobility could judge
 what twere to lose it and be miserable
 they that stand high have many blasts to shake them
 and if they fall they dash themselves to pieces
gloucester good counsel marry learn it learn it marquess
dorset it toucheth you my lord as much as me
gloucester yea and much more but i was born so high
 our aery buildeth in the cedar's top
 and dallies with the wind and scorns the sun
queen margaret and turns the sun to shade alas alas
 witness my son now in the shade of death
 whose bright outshining beams thy cloudy wrath
 hath in eternal darkness folded up
 your aery buildeth in our aery's nest
 o god that seest it do not suffer it
 as it was won with blood lost be it so
buckingham have done for shame if not for charity
queen margaret urge neither charity nor shame to me
 uncharitably with me have you dealt
 and shamefully by you my hopes are butcher'd
 my charity is outrage life my shame
 and in that shame still live my sorrow's rage
buckingham have done have done
queen margaret o princely buckingham i'll kiss thy hand
 in sign of league and amity with thee
 now fair befal thee and thy noble house
 thy garments are not spotted with our blood
 nor thou within the compass of my curse
buckingham nor no one here for curses never pass
 the lips of those that breathe them in the air
queen margaret i'll not believe but they ascend the sky
 and there awake god's gentlesleeping peace
 o buckingham take heed of yonder dog
 look when he fawns he bites and when he bites
 his venom tooth will rankle to the death
 have not to do with him beware of him
 sin death and hell have set their marks on him
 and all their ministers attend on him
gloucester what doth she say my lord of buckingham
buckingham nothing that i respect my gracious lord
queen margaret what dost thou scorn me for my gentle counsel
 and soothe the devil that i warn thee from
 o but remember this another day
 when he shall split thy very heart with sorrow
 and say poor margaret was a prophetess
 live each of you the subjects to his hate
 and he to yours and all of you to god's
 exit
hastings my hair doth stand on end to hear her curses
rivers and so doth mine i muse why she's at liberty
gloucester i cannot blame her by god's holy mother
 she hath had too much wrong and i repent
 my part thereof that i have done to her
queen elizabeth i never did her any to my knowledge
gloucester but you have all the vantage of her wrong
 i was too hot to do somebody good
 that is too cold in thinking of it now
 marry as for clarence he is well repaid
 he is frank'd up to fatting for his pains
 god pardon them that are the cause of it
rivers a virtuous and a christianlike conclusion
 to pray for them that have done scathe to us
gloucester so do i ever
 aside
 being welladvised
 for had i cursed now i had cursed myself
 enter catesby
catesby madam his majesty doth call for you
 and for your grace and you my noble lords
queen elizabeth catesby we come lords will you go with us
