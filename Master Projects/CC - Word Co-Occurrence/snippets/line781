 all this divided york and lancaster
 divided in their dire division
 o now let richmond and elizabeth
 the true succeeders of each royal house
 by god's fair ordinance conjoin together
 and let their heirs god if thy will be so
 enrich the time to come with smoothfaced peace
 with smiling plenty and fair prosperous days
 abate the edge of traitors gracious lord
 that would reduce these bloody days again
 and make poor england weep in streams of blood
 let them not live to taste this land's increase
 that would with treason wound this fair land's peace
 now civil wounds are stopp'd peace lives again
 that she may long live here god say amen
 exeunt
