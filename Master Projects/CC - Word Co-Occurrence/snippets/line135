and a certain man lame from his mother's womb was carried whom they laid daily at the gate of the temple which is called beautiful to ask alms of them that entered into the temple
who seeing peter and john about to go into the temple asked an alms
and peter fastening his eyes upon him with john said look on us
and he gave heed unto them expecting to receive something of them
then peter said silver and gold have i none but such as i have give i thee in the name of jesus christ of nazareth rise up and walk
and he took him by the right hand and lifted him up and immediately his feet and ankle bones received strength
and he leaping up stood and walked and entered with them into the temple walking and leaping and praising god
and all the people saw him walking and praising god
and they knew that it was he which sat for alms at the beautiful gate of the temple and they were filled with wonder and amazement at that which had happened unto him
and as the lame man which was healed held peter and john all the people ran together unto them in the porch that is called solomon's greatly wondering
and when peter saw it he answered unto the people ye men of israel why marvel ye at this or why look ye so earnestly on us as though by our own power or holiness we had made this man to walk
the god of abraham and of isaac and of jacob the god of our fathers hath glorified his son jesus whom ye delivered up and denied him in the presence of pilate when he was determined to let him go
but ye denied the holy one and the just and desired a murderer to be granted unto you
and killed the prince of life whom god hath raised from the dead whereof we are witnesses
and his name through faith in his name hath made this man strong whom ye see and know yea the faith which is by him hath given him this perfect soundness in the presence of you all
and now brethren i wot that through ignorance ye did it as did also your rulers
but those things which god before had shewed by the mouth of all his prophets that christ should suffer he hath so fulfilled
repent ye therefore and be converted that your sins may be blotted out when the times of refreshing shall come from the presence of the lord
and he shall send jesus christ which before was preached unto you
whom the heaven must receive until the times of restitution of all things which god hath spoken by the mouth of all his holy prophets since the world began
for moses truly said unto the fathers a prophet shall the lord your god raise up unto you of your brethren like unto me him shall ye hear in all things whatsoever he shall say unto you
and it shall come to pass that every soul which will not hear that prophet shall be destroyed from among the people
yea and all the prophets from samuel and those that follow after as many as have spoken have likewise foretold of these days
ye are the children of the prophets and of the covenant which god made with our fathers saying unto abraham and in thy seed shall all the kindreds of the earth be blessed
unto you first god having raised up his son jesus sent him to bless you in turning away every one of you from his iniquities
and as they spake unto the people the priests and the captain of the temple and the sadducees came upon them
being grieved that they taught the people and preached through jesus the resurrection from the dead
and they laid hands on them and put them in hold unto the next day for it was now eventide
howbeit many of them which heard the word believed and the number of the men was about five thousand
and it came to pass on the morrow that their rulers and elders and scribes
and annas the high priest and caiaphas and john and alexander and as many as were of the kindred of the high priest were gathered together at jerusalem
and when they had set them in the midst they asked by what power or by what name have ye done this
then peter filled with the holy ghost said unto them ye rulers of the people and elders of israel
if we this day be examined of the good deed done to the impotent man by what means he is made whole
be it known unto you all and to all the people of israel that by the name of jesus christ of nazareth whom ye crucified whom god raised from the dead even by him doth this man stand here before you whole
this is the stone which was set at nought of you builders which is become the head of the corner
neither is there salvation in any other for there is none other name under heaven given among men whereby we must be saved
now when they saw the boldness of peter and john and perceived that they were unlearned and ignorant men they marvelled and they took knowledge of them that they had been with jesus
and beholding the man which was healed standing with them they could say nothing against it
but when they had commanded them to go aside out of the council they conferred among themselves
saying what shall we do to these men for that indeed a notable miracle hath been done by them is manifest to all them that dwell in jerusalem and we cannot deny it
but that it spread no further among the people let us straitly threaten them that they speak henceforth to no man in this name
and they called them and commanded them not to speak at all nor teach in the name of jesus
but peter and john answered and said unto them whether it be right in the sight of god to hearken unto you more than unto god judge ye
for we cannot but speak the things which we have seen and heard
so when they had further threatened them they let them go finding nothing how they might punish them because of the people for all men glorified god for that which was done
for the man was above forty years old on whom this miracle of healing was shewed
and being let go they went to their own company and reported all that the chief priests and elders had said unto them
and when they heard that they lifted up their voice to god with one accord and said lord thou art god which hast made heaven and earth and the sea and all that in them is
who by the mouth of thy servant david hast said why did the heathen rage and the people imagine vain things
the kings of the earth stood up and the rulers were gathered together against the lord and against his christ
for of a truth against thy holy child jesus whom thou hast anointed both herod and pontius pilate with the gentiles and the people of israel were gathered together
for to do whatsoever thy hand and thy counsel determined before to be done
and now lord behold their threatenings and grant unto thy servants that with all boldness they may speak thy word
by stretching forth thine hand to heal and that signs and wonders may be done by the name of thy holy child jesus
and when they had prayed the place was shaken where they were assembled together and they were all filled with the holy ghost and they spake the word of god with boldness
and the multitude of them that believed were of one heart and of one soul neither said any of them that ought of the things which he possessed was his own but they had all things common
and with great power gave the apostles witness of the resurrection of the lord jesus and great grace was upon them all
neither was there any among them that lacked for as many as were possessors of lands or houses sold them and brought the prices of the things that were sold
and laid them down at the apostles feet and distribution was made unto every man according as he had need
and joses who by the apostles was surnamed barnabas which is being interpreted the son of consolation a levite and of the country of cyprus
having land sold it and brought the money and laid it at the apostles feet
but a certain man named ananias with sapphira his wife sold a possession
and kept back part of the price his wife also being privy to it and brought a certain part and laid it at the apostles feet
but peter said ananias why hath satan filled thine heart to lie to the holy ghost and to keep back part of the price of the land
whiles it remained was it not thine own and after it was sold was it not in thine own power why hast thou conceived this thing in thine heart thou hast not lied unto men but unto god
and ananias hearing these words fell down and gave up the ghost and great fear came on all them that heard these things
and the young men arose wound him up and carried him out and buried him
and it was about the space of three hours after when his wife not knowing what was done came in
and peter answered unto her tell me whether ye sold the land for so much and she said yea for so much
then peter said unto her how is it that ye have agreed together to tempt the spirit of the lord behold the feet of them which have buried thy husband are at the door and shall carry thee out
then fell she down straightway at his feet and yielded up the ghost and the young men came in and found her dead and carrying her forth buried her by her husband
and great fear came upon all the church and upon as many as heard these things
and by the hands of the apostles were many signs and wonders wrought among the people and they were all with one accord in solomon's porch
and of the rest durst no man join himself to them but the people magnified them
and believers were the more added to the lord multitudes both of men and women
insomuch that they brought forth the sick into the streets and laid them on beds and couches that at the least the shadow of peter passing by might overshadow some of them
there came also a multitude out of the cities round about unto jerusalem bringing sick folks and them which were vexed with unclean spirits and they were healed every one
then the high priest rose up and all they that were with him which is the sect of the sadducees and were filled with indignation
and laid their hands on the apostles and put them in the common prison
but the angel of the lord by night opened the prison doors and brought them forth and said
go stand and speak in the temple to the people all the words of this life
and when they heard that they entered into the temple early in the morning and taught but the high priest came and they that were with him and called the council together and all the senate of the children of israel and sent to the prison to have them brought
but when the officers came and found them not in the prison they returned and told
saying the prison truly found we shut with all safety and the keepers standing without before the doors but when we had opened we found no man within
now when the high priest and the captain of the temple and the chief priests heard these things they doubted of them whereunto this would grow
then came one and told them saying behold the men whom ye put in prison are standing in the temple and teaching the people
then went the captain with the officers and brought them without violence for they feared the people lest they should have been stoned
and when they had brought them they set them before the council and the high priest asked them
saying did not we straitly command you that ye should not teach in this name and behold ye have filled jerusalem with your doctrine and intend to bring this man's blood upon us
then peter and the other apostles answered and said we ought to obey god rather than men
the god of our fathers raised up jesus whom ye slew and hanged on a tree
him hath god exalted with his right hand to be a prince and a saviour for to give repentance to israel and forgiveness of sins
and we are his witnesses of these things and so is also the holy ghost whom god hath given to them that obey him
when they heard that they were cut to the heart and took counsel to slay them
then stood there up one in the council a pharisee named gamaliel a doctor of the law had in reputation among all the people and commanded to put the apostles forth a little space
and said unto them ye men of israel take heed to yourselves what ye intend to do as touching these men
for before these days rose up theudas boasting himself to be somebody to whom a number of men about four hundred joined themselves who was slain and all as many as obeyed him were scattered and brought to nought
after this man rose up judas of galilee in the days of the taxing and drew away much people after him he also perished and all even as many as obeyed him were dispersed
and now i say unto you refrain from these men and let them alone for if this counsel or this work be of men it will come to nought
but if it be of god ye cannot overthrow it lest haply ye be found even to fight against god
and to him they agreed and when they had called the apostles and beaten them they commanded that they should not speak in the name of jesus and let them go
and they departed from the presence of the council rejoicing that they were counted worthy to suffer shame for his name
and daily in the temple and in every house they ceased not to teach and preach jesus christ
and in those days when the number of the disciples was multiplied there arose a murmuring of the grecians against the hebrews because their widows were neglected in the daily ministration
then the twelve called the multitude of the disciples unto them and said it is not reason that we should leave the word of god and serve tables
wherefore brethren look ye out among you seven men of honest report full of the holy ghost and wisdom whom we may appoint over this business
but we will give ourselves continually to prayer and to the ministry of the word
and the saying pleased the whole multitude and they chose stephen a man full of faith and of the holy ghost and philip and prochorus and nicanor and timon and parmenas and nicolas a proselyte of antioch
whom they set before the apostles and when they had prayed they laid their hands on them
and the word of god increased and the number of the disciples multiplied in jerusalem greatly and a great company of the priests were obedient to the faith
and stephen full of faith and power did great wonders and miracles among the people
then there arose certain of the synagogue which is called the synagogue of the libertines and cyrenians and alexandrians and of them of cilicia and of asia disputing with stephen
and they were not able to resist the wisdom and the spirit by which he spake
then they suborned men which said we have heard him speak blasphemous words against moses and against god
and they stirred up the people and the elders and the scribes and came upon him and caught him and brought him to the council
and set up false witnesses which said this man ceaseth not to speak blasphemous words against this holy place and the law
for we have heard him say that this jesus of nazareth shall destroy this place and shall change the customs which moses delivered us
and all that sat in the council looking stedfastly on him saw his face as it had been the face of an angel
then said the high priest are these things so
and he said men brethren and fathers hearken the god of glory appeared unto our father abraham when he was in mesopotamia before he dwelt in charran
and said unto him get thee out of thy country and from thy kindred and come into the land which i shall shew thee
then came he out of the land of the chaldaeans and dwelt in charran and from thence when his father was dead he removed him into this land wherein ye now dwell
and he gave him none inheritance in it no not so much as to set his foot on yet he promised that he would give it to him for a possession and to his seed after him when as yet he had no child
and god spake on this wise that his seed should sojourn in a strange land and that they should bring them into bondage and entreat them evil four hundred years
and the nation to whom they shall be in bondage will i judge said god and after that shall they come forth and serve me in this place
and he gave him the covenant of circumcision and so abraham begat isaac and circumcised him the eighth day and isaac begat jacob and jacob begat the twelve patriarchs
and the patriarchs moved with envy sold joseph into egypt but god was with him
and delivered him out of all his afflictions and gave him favour and wisdom in the sight of pharaoh king of egypt and he made him governor over egypt and all his house
now there came a dearth over all the land of egypt and chanaan and great affliction and our fathers found no sustenance
but when jacob heard that there was corn in egypt he sent out our fathers first
and at the second time joseph was made known to his brethren and joseph's kindred was made known unto pharaoh
then sent joseph and called his father jacob to him and all his kindred threescore and fifteen souls
so jacob went down into egypt and died he and our fathers
and were carried over into sychem and laid in the sepulchre that abraham bought for a sum of money of the sons of emmor the father of sychem
but when the time of the promise drew nigh which god had sworn to abraham the people grew and multiplied in egypt
till another king arose which knew not joseph
the same dealt subtilly with our kindred and evil entreated our fathers so that they cast out their young children to the end they might not live
in which time moses was born and was exceeding fair and nourished up in his father's house three months
and when he was cast out pharaoh's daughter took him up and nourished him for her own son
and moses was learned in all the wisdom of the egyptians and was mighty in words and in deeds
and when he was full forty years old it came into his heart to visit his brethren the children of israel
and seeing one of them suffer wrong he defended him and avenged him that was oppressed and smote the egyptian
for he supposed his brethren would have understood how that god by his hand would deliver them but they understood not
and the next day he shewed himself unto them as they strove and would have set them at one again saying sirs ye are brethren why do ye wrong one to another
but he that did his neighbour wrong thrust him away saying who made thee a ruler and a judge over us
wilt thou kill me as thou diddest the egyptian yesterday
then fled moses at this saying and was a stranger in the land of madian where he begat two sons
and when forty years were expired there appeared to him in the wilderness of mount sina an angel of the lord in a flame of fire in a bush
when moses saw it he wondered at the sight and as he drew near to behold it the voice of the lord came unto him
saying i am the god of thy fathers the god of abraham and the god of isaac and the god of jacob then moses trembled and durst not behold
then said the lord to him put off thy shoes from thy feet for the place where thou standest is holy ground
i have seen i have seen the affliction of my people which is in egypt and i have heard their groaning and am come down to deliver them and now come i will send thee into egypt
this moses whom they refused saying who made thee a ruler and a judge the same did god send to be a ruler and a deliverer by the hand of the angel which appeared to him in the bush
he brought them out after that he had shewed wonders and signs in the land of egypt and in the red sea and in the wilderness forty years
this is that moses which said unto the children of israel a prophet shall the lord your god raise up unto you of your brethren like unto me him shall ye hear
this is he that was in the church in the wilderness with the angel which spake to him in the mount sina and with our fathers who received the lively oracles to give unto us
to whom our fathers would not obey but thrust him from them and in their hearts turned back again into egypt
saying unto aaron make us gods to go before us for as for this moses which brought us out of the land of egypt we wot not what is become of him
and they made a calf in those days and offered sacrifice unto the idol and rejoiced in the works of their own hands
then god turned and gave them up to worship the host of heaven as it is written in the book of the prophets o ye house of israel have ye offered to me slain beasts and sacrifices by the space of forty years in the wilderness
yea ye took up the tabernacle of moloch and the star of your god remphan figures which ye made to worship them and i will carry you away beyond babylon
our fathers had the tabernacle of witness in the wilderness as he had appointed speaking unto moses that he should make it according to the fashion that he had seen
which also our fathers that came after brought in with jesus into the possession of the gentiles whom god drave out before the face of our fathers unto the days of david
who found favour before god and desired to find a tabernacle for the god of jacob
but solomon built him an house
howbeit the most high dwelleth not in temples made with hands as saith the prophet
heaven is my throne and earth is my footstool what house will ye build me saith the lord or what is the place of my rest
hath not my hand made all these things
ye stiffnecked and uncircumcised in heart and ears ye do always resist the holy ghost as your fathers did so do ye
which of the prophets have not your fathers persecuted and they have slain them which shewed before of the coming of the just one of whom ye have been now the betrayers and murderers
who have received the law by the disposition of angels and have not kept it
when they heard these things they were cut to the heart and they gnashed on him with their teeth
but he being full of the holy ghost looked up stedfastly into heaven and saw the glory of god and jesus standing on the right hand of god
and said behold i see the heavens opened and the son of man standing on the right hand of god
then they cried out with a loud voice and stopped their ears and ran upon him with one accord
and cast him out of the city and stoned him and the witnesses laid down their clothes at a young man's feet whose name was saul
and they stoned stephen calling upon god and saying lord jesus receive my spirit
and he kneeled down and cried with a loud voice lord lay not this sin to their charge and when he had said this he fell asleep
and saul was consenting unto his death and at that time there was a great persecution against the church which was at jerusalem and they were all scattered abroad throughout the regions of judaea and samaria except the apostles
and devout men carried stephen to his burial and made great lamentation over him
as for saul he made havock of the church entering into every house and haling men and women committed them to prison
therefore they that were scattered abroad went every where preaching the word
then philip went down to the city of samaria and preached christ unto them
and the people with one accord gave heed unto those things which philip spake hearing and seeing the miracles which he did
for unclean spirits crying with loud voice came out of many that were possessed with them and many taken with palsies and that were lame were healed
and there was great joy in that city
but there was a certain man called simon which beforetime in the same city used sorcery and bewitched the people of samaria giving out that himself was some great one
to whom they all gave heed from the least to the greatest saying this man is the great power of god
and to him they had regard because that of long time he had bewitched them with sorceries
but when they believed philip preaching the things concerning the kingdom of god and the name of jesus christ they were baptized both men and women
then simon himself believed also and when he was baptized he continued with philip and wondered beholding the miracles and signs which were done
now when the apostles which were at jerusalem heard that samaria had received the word of god they sent unto them peter and john
who when they were come down prayed for them that they might receive the holy ghost
for as yet he was fallen upon none of them only they were baptized in the name of the lord jesus
then laid they their hands on them and they received the holy ghost
and when simon saw that through laying on of the apostles hands the holy ghost was given he offered them money
saying give me also this power that on whomsoever i lay hands he may receive the holy ghost
but peter said unto him thy money perish with thee because thou hast thought that the gift of god may be purchased with money
thou hast neither part nor lot in this matter for thy heart is not right in the sight of god
