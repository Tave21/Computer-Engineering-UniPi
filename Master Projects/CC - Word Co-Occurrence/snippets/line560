 my fame is shrewdly gored
patroclus o then beware
 those wounds heal ill that men do give themselves
 omission to do what is necessary
 seals a commission to a blank of danger
 and danger like an ague subtly taints
 even then when we sit idly in the sun
achilles go call thersites hither sweet patroclus
 i'll send the fool to ajax and desire him
 to invite the trojan lords after the combat
 to see us here unarm'd i have a woman's longing
 an appetite that i am sick withal
 to see great hector in his weeds of peace
 to talk with him and to behold his visage
 even to my full of view
 enter thersites
 a labour saved
thersites a wonder
achilles what
thersites ajax goes up and down the field asking for himself
achilles how so
thersites he must fight singly tomorrow with hector and is so
 prophetically proud of an heroical cudgelling that he
 raves in saying nothing
achilles how can that be
thersites why he stalks up and down like a peacocka stride
 and a stand ruminates like an hostess that hath no
 arithmetic but her brain to set down her reckoning
 bites his lip with a politic regard as who should
 say there were wit in this head an twould out'
 and so there is but it lies as coldly in him as fire
 in a flint which will not show without knocking
 the man's undone forever for if hector break not his
 neck i the combat he'll break t himself in
 vainglory he knows not me i said good morrow
 ajax and he replies thanks agamemnon what think
 you of this man that takes me for the general he's
 grown a very landfish languageless a monster
 a plague of opinion a man may wear it on both
 sides like a leather jerkin
achilles thou must be my ambassador to him thersites
thersites who i why he'll answer nobody he professes not
 answering speaking is for beggars he wears his
 tongue in's arms i will put on his presence let
 patroclus make demands to me you shall see the
 pageant of ajax
achilles to him patroclus tell him i humbly desire the
 valiant ajax to invite the most valorous hector
 to come unarmed to my tent and to procure
 safeconduct for his person of the magnanimous
 and most illustrious sixorseventimeshonoured
 captaingeneral of the grecian army agamemnon
 et cetera do this
patroclus jove bless great ajax
thersites hum
patroclus i come from the worthy achilles
thersites ha
patroclus who most humbly desires you to invite hector to his tent
thersites hum
patroclus and to procure safeconduct from agamemnon
thersites agamemnon
patroclus ay my lord
thersites ha
patroclus what say you to't
thersites god b wi you with all my heart
patroclus your answer sir
thersites if tomorrow be a fair day by eleven o'clock it will
 go one way or other howsoever he shall pay for me
 ere he has me
patroclus your answer sir
thersites fare you well with all my heart
achilles why but he is not in this tune is he
thersites no but he's out o tune thus what music will be in
 him when hector has knocked out his brains i know
 not but i am sure none unless the fiddler apollo
 get his sinews to make catlings on
achilles come thou shalt bear a letter to him straight
thersites let me bear another to his horse for that's the more
 capable creature
achilles my mind is troubled like a fountain stirr'd
 and i myself see not the bottom of it
 exeunt achilles and patroclus
thersites would the fountain of your mind were clear again
 that i might water an ass at it i had rather be a
 tick in a sheep than such a valiant ignorance
 exit
 troilus and cressida
act iv
scene i troy a street
 enter from one side aeneas and servant with a
 torch from the other paris deiphobus antenor
 diomedes and others with torches
paris see ho who is that there
deiphobus it is the lord aeneas
aeneas is the prince there in person
 had i so good occasion to lie long
 as you prince paris nothing but heavenly business
 should rob my bedmate of my company
diomedes that's my mind too good morrow lord aeneas
paris a valiant greek aeneastake his hand
 witness the process of your speech wherein
 you told how diomed a whole week by days
 did haunt you in the field
aeneas health to you valiant sir
 during all question of the gentle truce
 but when i meet you arm'd as black defiance
 as heart can think or courage execute
diomedes the one and other diomed embraces
 our bloods are now in calm and so long health
 but when contention and occasion meet
 by jove i'll play the hunter for thy life
 with all my force pursuit and policy
aeneas and thou shalt hunt a lion that will fly
 with his face backward in humane gentleness
 welcome to troy now by anchises life
 welcome indeed by venus hand i swear
 no man alive can love in such a sort
 the thing he means to kill more excellently
diomedes we sympathize jove let aeneas live
 if to my sword his fate be not the glory
 a thousand complete courses of the sun
 but in mine emulous honour let him die
 with every joint a wound and that tomorrow
aeneas we know each other well
diomedes we do and long to know each other worse
paris this is the most despiteful gentle greeting
 the noblest hateful love that e'er i heard of
 what business lord so early
aeneas i was sent for to the king but why i know not
paris his purpose meets you twas to bring this greek
 to calchas house and there to render him
 for the enfreed antenor the fair cressid
 let's have your company or if you please
 haste there before us i constantly do think
 or rather call my thought a certain knowledge
 my brother troilus lodges there tonight
 rouse him and give him note of our approach
 with the whole quality wherefore i fear
 we shall be much unwelcome
aeneas that i assure you
 troilus had rather troy were borne to greece
 than cressid borne from troy
paris there is no help
 the bitter disposition of the time
 will have it so on lord we'll follow you
aeneas good morrow all
 exit with servant
paris and tell me noble diomed faith tell me true
 even in the soul of sound goodfellowship
 who in your thoughts merits fair helen best
 myself or menelaus
diomedes both alike
 he merits well to have her that doth seek her
 not making any scruple of her soilure
 with such a hell of pain and world of charge
 and you as well to keep her that defend her
 not palating the taste of her dishonour
 with such a costly loss of wealth and friends
 he like a puling cuckold would drink up
 the lees and dregs of a flat tamed piece
 you like a lecher out of whorish loins
 are pleased to breed out your inheritors
 both merits poised each weighs nor less nor more
 but he as he the heavier for a whore
paris you are too bitter to your countrywoman
diomedes she's bitter to her country hear me paris
 for every false drop in her bawdy veins
 a grecian's life hath sunk for every scruple
 of her contaminated carrion weight
 a trojan hath been slain since she could speak
 she hath not given so many good words breath
 as for her greeks and trojans suffer'd death
paris fair diomed you do as chapmen do
 dispraise the thing that you desire to buy
 but we in silence hold this virtue well
 we'll but commend what we intend to sell
 here lies our way
 exeunt
 troilus and cressida
act iv
scene ii the same court of pandarus house
 enter troilus and cressida
troilus dear trouble not yourself the morn is cold
cressida then sweet my lord i'll call mine uncle down
 he shall unbolt the gates
troilus trouble him not
 to bed to bed sleep kill those pretty eyes
 and give as soft attachment to thy senses
 as infants empty of all thought
cressida good morrow then
troilus i prithee now to bed
cressida are you aweary of me
troilus o cressida but that the busy day
 waked by the lark hath roused the ribald crows
 and dreaming night will hide our joys no longer
 i would not from thee
cressida night hath been too brief
troilus beshrew the witch with venomous wights she stays
 as tediously as hell but flies the grasps of love
 with wings more momentaryswift than thought
