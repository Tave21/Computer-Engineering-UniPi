 the treason that my haste forbids me show
duke of aumerle remember as thou read'st thy promise pass'd
 i do repent me read not my name there
 my heart is not confederate with my hand
duke of york it was villain ere thy hand did set it down
 i tore it from the traitor's bosom king
 fear and not love begets his penitence
 forget to pity him lest thy pity prove
 a serpent that will sting thee to the heart
henry bolingbroke o heinous strong and bold conspiracy
 o loyal father of a treacherous son
 thou sheer immaculate and silver fountain
 from when this stream through muddy passages
 hath held his current and defiled himself
 thy overflow of good converts to bad
 and thy abundant goodness shall excuse
 this deadly blot in thy digressing son
duke of york so shall my virtue be his vice's bawd
 and he shall spend mine honour with his shame
 as thriftless sons their scraping fathers gold
 mine honour lives when his dishonour dies
 or my shamed life in his dishonour lies
 thou kill'st me in his life giving him breath
 the traitor lives the true man's put to death
duchess of york within what ho my liege for god's sake
 let me in
henry bolingbroke what shrillvoiced suppliant makes this eager cry
duchess of york a woman and thy aunt great king tis i
 speak with me pity me open the door
 a beggar begs that never begg'd before
henry bolingbroke our scene is alter'd from a serious thing
 and now changed to the beggar and the king'
 my dangerous cousin let your mother in
 i know she is come to pray for your foul sin
duke of york if thou do pardon whosoever pray
 more sins for this forgiveness prosper may
 this fester'd joint cut off the rest rest sound
 this let alone will all the rest confound
 enter duchess of york
duchess of york o king believe not this hardhearted man
 love loving not itself none other can
duke of york thou frantic woman what dost thou make here
 shall thy old dugs once more a traitor rear
duchess of york sweet york be patient hear me gentle liege
 kneels
henry bolingbroke rise up good aunt
duchess of york not yet i thee beseech
 for ever will i walk upon my knees
 and never see day that the happy sees
 till thou give joy until thou bid me joy
 by pardoning rutland my transgressing boy
duke of aumerle unto my mother's prayers i bend my knee
duke of york against them both my true joints bended be
 ill mayst thou thrive if thou grant any grace
duchess of york pleads he in earnest look upon his face
 his eyes do drop no tears his prayers are in jest
 his words come from his mouth ours from our breast
 he prays but faintly and would be denied
 we pray with heart and soul and all beside
 his weary joints would gladly rise i know
 our knees shall kneel till to the ground they grow
 his prayers are full of false hypocrisy
 ours of true zeal and deep integrity
 our prayers do outpray his then let them have
 that mercy which true prayer ought to have
henry bolingbroke good aunt stand up
duchess of york nay do not say stand up'
 say pardon first and afterwards stand up'
 and if i were thy nurse thy tongue to teach
 pardon should be the first word of thy speech
 i never long'd to hear a word till now
 say pardon king let pity teach thee how
 the word is short but not so short as sweet
 no word like pardon for kings mouths so meet
duke of york speak it in french king say pardonne moi'
duchess of york dost thou teach pardon pardon to destroy
 ah my sour husband my hardhearted lord
 that set'st the word itself against the word
 speak pardon as tis current in our land
 the chopping french we do not understand
 thine eye begins to speak set thy tongue there
 or in thy piteous heart plant thou thine ear
 that hearing how our plaints and prayers do pierce
 pity may move thee pardon to rehearse
henry bolingbroke good aunt stand up
duchess of york i do not sue to stand
 pardon is all the suit i have in hand
henry bolingbroke i pardon him as god shall pardon me
duchess of york o happy vantage of a kneeling knee
 yet am i sick for fear speak it again
 twice saying pardon doth not pardon twain
 but makes one pardon strong
henry bolingbroke with all my heart
 i pardon him
duchess of york a god on earth thou art
henry bolingbroke but for our trusty brotherinlaw and the abbot
 with all the rest of that consorted crew
 destruction straight shall dog them at the heels
 good uncle help to order several powers
 to oxford or where'er these traitors are
 they shall not live within this world i swear
 but i will have them if i once know where
 uncle farewell and cousin too adieu
 your mother well hath pray'd and prove you true
duchess of york come my old son i pray god make thee new

 exeunt
 king richard ii
act v
scene v pomfret castle
 enter king richard
king richard ii i have been studying how i may compare
 this prison where i live unto the world
 and for because the world is populous
 and here is not a creature but myself
 i cannot do it yet i'll hammer it out
 my brain i'll prove the female to my soul
 my soul the father and these two beget
 a generation of stillbreeding thoughts
 and these same thoughts people this little world
 in humours like the people of this world
 for no thought is contented the better sort
 as thoughts of things divine are intermix'd
 with scruples and do set the word itself
 against the word
 as thus come little ones and then again
 it is as hard to come as for a camel
 to thread the postern of a small needle's eye'
 thoughts tending to ambition they do plot
 unlikely wonders how these vain weak nails
 may tear a passage through the flinty ribs
 of this hard world my ragged prison walls
 and for they cannot die in their own pride
 thoughts tending to content flatter themselves
 that they are not the first of fortune's slaves
 nor shall not be the last like silly beggars
 who sitting in the stocks refuge their shame
 that many have and others must sit there
 and in this thought they find a kind of ease
 bearing their own misfortunes on the back
 of such as have before endured the like
 thus play i in one person many people
 and none contented sometimes am i king
 then treasons make me wish myself a beggar
 and so i am then crushing penury
 persuades me i was better when a king
 then am i king'd again and by and by
 think that i am unking'd by bolingbroke
 and straight am nothing but whate'er i be
 nor i nor any man that but man is
 with nothing shall be pleased till he be eased
 with being nothing music do i hear
 music
 ha ha keep time how sour sweet music is
 when time is broke and no proportion kept
 so is it in the music of men's lives
 and here have i the daintiness of ear
 to cheque time broke in a disorder'd string
 but for the concord of my state and time
 had not an ear to hear my true time broke
 i wasted time and now doth time waste me
 for now hath time made me his numbering clock
 my thoughts are minutes and with sighs they jar
 their watches on unto mine eyes the outward watch
 whereto my finger like a dial's point
 is pointing still in cleansing them from tears
 now sir the sound that tells what hour it is
 are clamorous groans which strike upon my heart
 which is the bell so sighs and tears and groans
 show minutes times and hours but my time
 runs posting on in bolingbroke's proud joy
 while i stand fooling here his jack o the clock
 this music mads me let it sound no more
 for though it have holp madmen to their wits
 in me it seems it will make wise men mad
 yet blessing on his heart that gives it me
 for tis a sign of love and love to richard
 is a strange brooch in this allhating world
 enter a groom of the stable
groom hail royal prince
king richard ii thanks noble peer
 the cheapest of us is ten groats too dear
 what art thou and how comest thou hither
 where no man never comes but that sad dog
