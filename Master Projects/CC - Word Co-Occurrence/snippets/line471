 the least if the love of soldier can suffice
 that i love thee i will not say pity me tis
 not a soldierlike phrase but i say love me by me
 thine own true knight
 by day or night
 or any kind of light
 with all his might
 for thee to fight john falstaff'
 what a herod of jewry is this o wicked
 world one that is wellnigh worn to pieces with
 age to show himself a young gallant what an
 unweighed behavior hath this flemish drunkard
 pickedwith the devil's nameout of my
 conversation that he dares in this manner assay me
 why he hath not been thrice in my company what
 should i say to him i was then frugal of my
 mirth heaven forgive me why i'll exhibit a bill
 in the parliament for the putting down of men how
 shall i be revenged on him for revenged i will be

 enter mistress ford
mistress ford mistress page trust me i was going to your house
mistress page and trust me i was coming to you you look very
 ill
mistress ford nay i'll ne'er believe that i have to show to the contrary
mistress page faith but you do in my mind
mistress ford well i do then yet i say i could show you to the
 contrary o mistress page give me some counsel
mistress page what's the matter woman
mistress ford o woman if it were not for one trifling respect i
 could come to such honour
mistress page hang the trifle woman take the honour what is
 it dispense with trifles what is it
mistress ford if i would but go to hell for an eternal moment or so
 i could be knighted
mistress page what thou liest sir alice ford these knights
 will hack and so thou shouldst not alter the
 article of thy gentry
mistress ford we burn daylight here read read perceive how i
 might be knighted i shall think the worse of fat
 men as long as i have an eye to make difference of
 men's liking and yet he would not swear praised
 women's modesty and gave such orderly and
 wellbehaved reproof to all uncomeliness that i
 would have sworn his disposition would have gone to
 the truth of his words but they do no more adhere
 and keep place together than the hundredth psalm to
 the tune of green sleeves what tempest i trow
 threw this whale with so many tuns of oil in his
 belly ashore at windsor how shall i be revenged
 on him i think the best way were to entertain him
 with hope till the wicked fire of lust have melted
 him in his own grease did you ever hear the like
mistress page letter for letter but that the name of page and
 ford differs to thy great comfort in this mystery
 of ill opinions here's the twinbrother of thy
 letter but let thine inherit first for i
 protest mine never shall i warrant he hath a
 thousand of these letters writ with blank space for
 different namessure moreand these are of the
 second edition he will print them out of doubt
 for he cares not what he puts into the press when
 he would put us two i had rather be a giantess
 and lie under mount pelion well i will find you
 twenty lascivious turtles ere one chaste man
mistress ford why this is the very same the very hand the very
 words what doth he think of us
mistress page nay i know not it makes me almost ready to
 wrangle with mine own honesty i'll entertain
 myself like one that i am not acquainted withal
 for sure unless he know some strain in me that i
 know not myself he would never have boarded me in this fury
mistress ford boarding call you it i'll be sure to keep him
 above deck
mistress page so will i if he come under my hatches i'll never
 to sea again let's be revenged on him let's
 appoint him a meeting give him a show of comfort in
 his suit and lead him on with a finebaited delay
 till he hath pawned his horses to mine host of the garter
mistress ford nay i will consent to act any villany against him
 that may not sully the chariness of our honesty o
 that my husband saw this letter it would give
 eternal food to his jealousy
mistress page why look where he comes and my good man too he's
 as far from jealousy as i am from giving him cause
 and that i hope is an unmeasurable distance
mistress ford you are the happier woman
