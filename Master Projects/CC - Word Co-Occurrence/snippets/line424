 a maid of grace and complete majesty
 about surrender up of aquitaine
 to her decrepit sick and bedrid father
 therefore this article is made in vain
 or vainly comes the admired princess hither
ferdinand what say you lords why this was quite forgot
biron so study evermore is overshot
 while it doth study to have what it would
 it doth forget to do the thing it should
 and when it hath the thing it hunteth most
 tis won as towns with fire so won so lost
ferdinand we must of force dispense with this decree
 she must lie here on mere necessity
biron necessity will make us all forsworn
 three thousand times within this three years space
 for every man with his affects is born
 not by might master'd but by special grace
 if i break faith this word shall speak for me
 i am forsworn on mere necessity'
 so to the laws at large i write my name
 subscribes
 and he that breaks them in the least degree
 stands in attainder of eternal shame
 suggestions are to other as to me
 but i believe although i seem so loath
 i am the last that will last keep his oath
 but is there no quick recreation granted
ferdinand ay that there is our court you know is haunted
 with a refined traveller of spain
 a man in all the world's new fashion planted
 that hath a mint of phrases in his brain
 one whom the music of his own vain tongue
 doth ravish like enchanting harmony
 a man of complements whom right and wrong
 have chose as umpire of their mutiny
 this child of fancy that armado hight
 for interim to our studies shall relate
 in highborn words the worth of many a knight
 from tawny spain lost in the world's debate
 how you delight my lords i know not i
 but i protest i love to hear him lie
 and i will use him for my minstrelsy
biron armado is a most illustrious wight
 a man of firenew words fashion's own knight
longaville costard the swain and he shall be our sport
 and so to study three years is but short
 enter dull with a letter and costard
dull which is the duke's own person
biron this fellow what wouldst
dull i myself reprehend his own person for i am his
 grace's tharborough but i would see his own person
 in flesh and blood
biron this is he
dull signior armearmecommends you there's villany
 abroad this letter will tell you more
costard sir the contempts thereof are as touching me
ferdinand a letter from the magnificent armado
biron how low soever the matter i hope in god for high words
longaville a high hope for a low heaven god grant us patience
biron to hear or forbear laughing
longaville to hear meekly sir and to laugh moderately or to
 forbear both
biron well sir be it as the style shall give us cause to
 climb in the merriness
costard the matter is to me sir as concerning jaquenetta
 the manner of it is i was taken with the manner
biron in what manner
costard in manner and form following sir all those three
 i was seen with her in the manorhouse sitting with
 her upon the form and taken following her into the
 park which put together is in manner and form
 following now sir for the mannerit is the
 manner of a man to speak to a woman for the form
 in some form
biron for the following sir
costard as it shall follow in my correction and god defend
 the right
ferdinand will you hear this letter with attention
biron as we would hear an oracle
costard such is the simplicity of man to hearken after the flesh
ferdinand reads great deputy the welkin's vicegerent and
 sole dominator of navarre my soul's earth's god
 and body's fostering patron'
costard not a word of costard yet
ferdinand reads so it is'
costard it may be so but if he say it is so he is in
 telling true but so
ferdinand peace
costard be to me and every man that dares not fight
ferdinand no words
costard of other men's secrets i beseech you
ferdinand reads so it is besieged with sablecoloured
 melancholy i did commend the blackoppressing humour
 to the most wholesome physic of thy healthgiving
 air and as i am a gentleman betook myself to
 walk the time when about the sixth hour when
 beasts most graze birds best peck and men sit down
 to that nourishment which is called supper so much
 for the time when now for the ground which which
 i mean i walked upon it is ycleped thy park then
 for the place where where i mean i did encounter
 that obscene and preposterous event that draweth
 from my snowwhite pen the eboncoloured ink which
 here thou viewest beholdest surveyest or seest
 but to the place where it standeth northnortheast
 and by east from the west corner of thy curious
 knotted garden there did i see that lowspirited
 swain that base minnow of thy mirth'
costard me
ferdinand reads that unlettered smallknowing soul'
costard me
ferdinand reads that shallow vassal'
costard still me
ferdinand reads which as i remember hight costard'
costard o me
ferdinand reads sorted and consorted contrary to thy
 established proclaimed edict and continent canon
 which witho withbut with this i passion to say
 wherewith
costard with a wench
ferdinand reads with a child of our grandmother eve a
 female or for thy more sweet understanding a
 woman him i as my everesteemed duty pricks me on
 have sent to thee to receive the meed of
 punishment by thy sweet grace's officer anthony
 dull a man of good repute carriage bearing and
 estimation'
dull me an't shall please you i am anthony dull
ferdinand reads for jaquenettaso is the weaker vessel
 called which i apprehended with the aforesaid
 swaini keep her as a vessel of the law's fury
 and shall at the least of thy sweet notice bring
 her to trial thine in all compliments of devoted
 and heartburning heat of duty
 don adriano de armado'

 the marking of it

 with a wench
costard i was taken with none sir i was taken with a damsel
ferdinand well it was proclaimed damsel'
costard this was no damsel neither sir she was a virgin
ferdinand it is so varied too for it was proclaimed virgin'
costard if it were i deny her virginity i was taken with a maid
ferdinand this maid will not serve your turn sir
costard this maid will serve my turn sir
ferdinand sir i will pronounce your sentence you shall fast
 a week with bran and water
costard i had rather pray a month with mutton and porridge
ferdinand and don armado shall be your keeper

 which each to other hath so strongly sworn
 exeunt ferdinand longaville and dumain

 girl and therefore welcome the sour cup of
 prosperity affliction may one day smile again and
