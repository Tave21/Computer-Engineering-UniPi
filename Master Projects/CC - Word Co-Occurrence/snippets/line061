and thou ezra after the wisdom of thy god that is in thine hand set magistrates and judges which may judge all the people that are beyond the river all such as know the laws of thy god and teach ye them that know them not
and whosoever will not do the law of thy god and the law of the king let judgment be executed speedily upon him whether it be unto death or to banishment or to confiscation of goods or to imprisonment
blessed be the lord god of our fathers which hath put such a thing as this in the king's heart to beautify the house of the lord which is in jerusalem
and hath extended mercy unto me before the king and his counsellors and before all the king's mighty princes and i was strengthened as the hand of the lord my god was upon me and i gathered together out of israel chief men to go up with me
these are now the chief of their fathers and this is the genealogy of them that went up with me from babylon in the reign of artaxerxes the king
of the sons of phinehas gershom of the sons of ithamar daniel of the sons of david hattush
of the sons of shechaniah of the sons of pharosh zechariah and with him were reckoned by genealogy of the males an hundred and fifty
of the sons of pahathmoab elihoenai the son of zerahiah and with him two hundred males
of the sons of shechaniah the son of jahaziel and with him three hundred males
of the sons also of adin ebed the son of jonathan and with him fifty males
and of the sons of elam jeshaiah the son of athaliah and with him seventy males
and of the sons of shephatiah zebadiah the son of michael and with him fourscore males
of the sons of joab obadiah the son of jehiel and with him two hundred and eighteen males
and of the sons of shelomith the son of josiphiah and with him an hundred and threescore males
and of the sons of bebai zechariah the son of bebai and with him twenty and eight males
and of the sons of azgad johanan the son of hakkatan and with him an hundred and ten males
and of the last sons of adonikam whose names are these eliphelet jeiel and shemaiah and with them threescore males
of the sons also of bigvai uthai and zabbud and with them seventy males
and i gathered them together to the river that runneth to ahava and there abode we in tents three days and i viewed the people and the priests and found there none of the sons of levi
then sent i for eliezer for ariel for shemaiah and for elnathan and for jarib and for elnathan and for nathan and for zechariah and for meshullam chief men also for joiarib and for elnathan men of understanding
and i sent them with commandment unto iddo the chief at the place casiphia and i told them what they should say unto iddo and to his brethren the nethinims at the place casiphia that they should bring unto us ministers for the house of our god
and by the good hand of our god upon us they brought us a man of understanding of the sons of mahli the son of levi the son of israel and sherebiah with his sons and his brethren eighteen
and hashabiah and with him jeshaiah of the sons of merari his brethren and their sons twenty
also of the nethinims whom david and the princes had appointed for the service of the levites two hundred and twenty nethinims all of them were expressed by name
then i proclaimed a fast there at the river of ahava that we might afflict ourselves before our god to seek of him a right way for us and for our little ones and for all our substance
for i was ashamed to require of the king a band of soldiers and horsemen to help us against the enemy in the way because we had spoken unto the king saying the hand of our god is upon all them for good that seek him but his power and his wrath is against all them that forsake him
so we fasted and besought our god for this and he was intreated of us
then i separated twelve of the chief of the priests sherebiah hashabiah and ten of their brethren with them
and weighed unto them the silver and the gold and the vessels even the offering of the house of our god which the king and his counsellors and his lords and all israel there present had offered
i even weighed unto their hand six hundred and fifty talents of silver and silver vessels an hundred talents and of gold an hundred talents
also twenty basons of gold of a thousand drams and two vessels of fine copper precious as gold
and i said unto them ye are holy unto the lord the vessels are holy also and the silver and the gold are a freewill offering unto the lord god of your fathers
watch ye and keep them until ye weigh them before the chief of the priests and the levites and chief of the fathers of israel at jerusalem in the chambers of the house of the lord
so took the priests and the levites the weight of the silver and the gold and the vessels to bring them to jerusalem unto the house of our god
then we departed from the river of ahava on the twelfth day of the first month to go unto jerusalem and the hand of our god was upon us and he delivered us from the hand of the enemy and of such as lay in wait by the way
and we came to jerusalem and abode there three days
now on the fourth day was the silver and the gold and the vessels weighed in the house of our god by the hand of meremoth the son of uriah the priest and with him was eleazar the son of phinehas and with them was jozabad the son of jeshua and noadiah the son of binnui levites
by number and by weight of every one and all the weight was written at that time
also the children of those that had been carried away which were come out of the captivity offered burnt offerings unto the god of israel twelve bullocks for all israel ninety and six rams seventy and seven lambs twelve he goats for a sin offering all this was a burnt offering unto the lord
and they delivered the king's commissions unto the king's lieutenants and to the governors on this side the river and they furthered the people and the house of god
now when these things were done the princes came to me saying the people of israel and the priests and the levites have not separated themselves from the people of the lands doing according to their abominations even of the canaanites the hittites the perizzites the jebusites the ammonites the moabites the egyptians and the amorites
for they have taken of their daughters for themselves and for their sons so that the holy seed have mingled themselves with the people of those lands yea the hand of the princes and rulers hath been chief in this trespass
and when i heard this thing i rent my garment and my mantle and plucked off the hair of my head and of my beard and sat down astonied
then were assembled unto me every one that trembled at the words of the god of israel because of the transgression of those that had been carried away and i sat astonied until the evening sacrifice
and at the evening sacrifice i arose up from my heaviness and having rent my garment and my mantle i fell upon my knees and spread out my hands unto the lord my god
and said o my god i am ashamed and blush to lift up my face to thee my god for our iniquities are increased over our head and our trespass is grown up unto the heavens
since the days of our fathers have we been in a great trespass unto this day and for our iniquities have we our kings and our priests been delivered into the hand of the kings of the lands to the sword to captivity and to a spoil and to confusion of face as it is this day
and now for a little space grace hath been shewed from the lord our god to leave us a remnant to escape and to give us a nail in his holy place that our god may lighten our eyes and give us a little reviving in our bondage
for we were bondmen yet our god hath not forsaken us in our bondage but hath extended mercy unto us in the sight of the kings of persia to give us a reviving to set up the house of our god and to repair the desolations thereof and to give us a wall in judah and in jerusalem
and now o our god what shall we say after this for we have forsaken thy commandments
which thou hast commanded by thy servants the prophets saying the land unto which ye go to possess it is an unclean land with the filthiness of the people of the lands with their abominations which have filled it from one end to another with their uncleanness
now therefore give not your daughters unto their sons neither take their daughters unto your sons nor seek their peace or their wealth for ever that ye may be strong and eat the good of the land and leave it for an inheritance to your children for ever
and after all that is come upon us for our evil deeds and for our great trespass seeing that thou our god hast punished us less than our iniquities deserve and hast given us such deliverance as this
should we again break thy commandments and join in affinity with the people of these abominations wouldest not thou be angry with us till thou hadst consumed us so that there should be no remnant nor escaping
o lord god of israel thou art righteous for we remain yet escaped as it is this day behold we are before thee in our trespasses for we cannot stand before thee because of this
now when ezra had prayed and when he had confessed weeping and casting himself down before the house of god there assembled unto him out of israel a very great congregation of men and women and children for the people wept very sore
and shechaniah the son of jehiel one of the sons of elam answered and said unto ezra we have trespassed against our god and have taken strange wives of the people of the land yet now there is hope in israel concerning this thing
now therefore let us make a covenant with our god to put away all the wives and such as are born of them according to the counsel of my lord and of those that tremble at the commandment of our god and let it be done according to the law
arise for this matter belongeth unto thee we also will be with thee be of good courage and do it
then arose ezra and made the chief priests the levites and all israel to swear that they should do according to this word and they sware
then ezra rose up from before the house of god and went into the chamber of johanan the son of eliashib and when he came thither he did eat no bread nor drink water for he mourned because of the transgression of them that had been carried away
and they made proclamation throughout judah and jerusalem unto all the children of the captivity that they should gather themselves together unto jerusalem
and that whosoever would not come within three days according to the counsel of the princes and the elders all his substance should be forfeited and himself separated from the congregation of those that had been carried away
then all the men of judah and benjamin gathered themselves together unto jerusalem within three days it was the ninth month on the twentieth day of the month and all the people sat in the street of the house of god trembling because of this matter and for the great rain
and ezra the priest stood up and said unto them ye have transgressed and have taken strange wives to increase the trespass of israel
now therefore make confession unto the lord god of your fathers and do his pleasure and separate yourselves from the people of the land and from the strange wives
then all the congregation answered and said with a loud voice as thou hast said so must we do
but the people are many and it is a time of much rain and we are not able to stand without neither is this a work of one day or two for we are many that have transgressed in this thing
let now our rulers of all the congregation stand and let all them which have taken strange wives in our cities come at appointed times and with them the elders of every city and the judges thereof until the fierce wrath of our god for this matter be turned from us
only jonathan the son of asahel and jahaziah the son of tikvah were employed about this matter and meshullam and shabbethai the levite helped them
and the children of the captivity did so and ezra the priest with certain chief of the fathers after the house of their fathers and all of them by their names were separated and sat down in the first day of the tenth month to examine the matter
and they made an end with all the men that had taken strange wives by the first day of the first month
and among the sons of the priests there were found that had taken strange wives namely of the sons of jeshua the son of jozadak and his brethren maaseiah and eliezer and jarib and gedaliah
and they gave their hands that they would put away their wives and being guilty they offered a ram of the flock for their trespass
and of the sons of immer hanani and zebadiah
and of the sons of harim maaseiah and elijah and shemaiah and jehiel and uzziah
and of the sons of pashur elioenai maaseiah ishmael nethaneel jozabad and elasah
also of the levites jozabad and shimei and kelaiah the same is kelita pethahiah judah and eliezer
of the singers also eliashib and of the porters shallum and telem and uri
moreover of israel of the sons of parosh ramiah and jeziah and malchiah and miamin and eleazar and malchijah and benaiah
and of the sons of elam mattaniah zechariah and jehiel and abdi and jeremoth and eliah
and of the sons of zattu elioenai eliashib mattaniah and jeremoth and zabad and aziza
of the sons also of bebai jehohanan hananiah zabbai and athlai
and of the sons of bani meshullam malluch and adaiah jashub and sheal and ramoth
and of the sons of pahathmoab adna and chelal benaiah maaseiah mattaniah bezaleel and binnui and manasseh
and of the sons of harim eliezer ishijah malchiah shemaiah shimeon

machnadebai shashai sharai
azareel and shelemiah shemariah
shallum amariah and joseph
of the sons of nebo jeiel mattithiah zabad zebina jadau and joel benaiah
all these had taken strange wives and some of them had wives by whom they had children
the words of nehemiah the son of hachaliah and it came to pass in the month chisleu in the twentieth year as i was in shushan the palace
that hanani one of my brethren came he and certain men of judah and i asked them concerning the jews that had escaped which were left of the captivity and concerning jerusalem
and they said unto me the remnant that are left of the captivity there in the province are in great affliction and reproach the wall of jerusalem also is broken down and the gates thereof are burned with fire
and it came to pass when i heard these words that i sat down and wept and mourned certain days and fasted and prayed before the god of heaven
and said i beseech thee o lord god of heaven the great and terrible god that keepeth covenant and mercy for them that love him and observe his commandments
let thine ear now be attentive and thine eyes open that thou mayest hear the prayer of thy servant which i pray before thee now day and night for the children of israel thy servants and confess the sins of the children of israel which we have sinned against thee both i and my father's house have sinned
we have dealt very corruptly against thee and have not kept the commandments nor the statutes nor the judgments which thou commandedst thy servant moses
remember i beseech thee the word that thou commandedst thy servant moses saying if ye transgress i will scatter you abroad among the nations
but if ye turn unto me and keep my commandments and do them though there were of you cast out unto the uttermost part of the heaven yet will i gather them from thence and will bring them unto the place that i have chosen to set my name there
now these are thy servants and thy people whom thou hast redeemed by thy great power and by thy strong hand
o lord i beseech thee let now thine ear be attentive to the prayer of thy servant and to the prayer of thy servants who desire to fear thy name and prosper i pray thee thy servant this day and grant him mercy in the sight of this man for i was the king's cupbearer
and it came to pass in the month nisan in the twentieth year of artaxerxes the king that wine was before him and i took up the wine and gave it unto the king now i had not been beforetime sad in his presence
wherefore the king said unto me why is thy countenance sad seeing thou art not sick this is nothing else but sorrow of heart then i was very sore afraid
and said unto the king let the king live for ever why should not my countenance be sad when the city the place of my fathers sepulchres lieth waste and the gates thereof are consumed with fire
then the king said unto me for what dost thou make request so i prayed to the god of heaven
and i said unto the king if it please the king and if thy servant have found favour in thy sight that thou wouldest send me unto judah unto the city of my fathers sepulchres that i may build it
and the king said unto me the queen also sitting by him for how long shall thy journey be and when wilt thou return so it pleased the king to send me and i set him a time
moreover i said unto the king if it please the king let letters be given me to the governors beyond the river that they may convey me over till i come into judah
and a letter unto asaph the keeper of the king's forest that he may give me timber to make beams for the gates of the palace which appertained to the house and for the wall of the city and for the house that i shall enter into and the king granted me according to the good hand of my god upon me
then i came to the governors beyond the river and gave them the king's letters now the king had sent captains of the army and horsemen with me
when sanballat the horonite and tobiah the servant the ammonite heard of it it grieved them exceedingly that there was come a man to seek the welfare of the children of israel
so i came to jerusalem and was there three days
and i arose in the night i and some few men with me neither told i any man what my god had put in my heart to do at jerusalem neither was there any beast with me save the beast that i rode upon
and i went out by night by the gate of the valley even before the dragon well and to the dung port and viewed the walls of jerusalem which were broken down and the gates thereof were consumed with fire
then i went on to the gate of the fountain and to the king's pool but there was no place for the beast that was under me to pass
then went i up in the night by the brook and viewed the wall and turned back and entered by the gate of the valley and so returned
and the rulers knew not whither i went or what i did neither had i as yet told it to the jews nor to the priests nor to the nobles nor to the rulers nor to the rest that did the work
then said i unto them ye see the distress that we are in how jerusalem lieth waste and the gates thereof are burned with fire come and let us build up the wall of jerusalem that we be no more a reproach
then i told them of the hand of my god which was good upon me as also the king's words that he had spoken unto me and they said let us rise up and build so they strengthened their hands for this good work
but when sanballat the horonite and tobiah the servant the ammonite and geshem the arabian heard it they laughed us to scorn and despised us and said what is this thing that ye do will ye rebel against the king
then answered i them and said unto them the god of heaven he will prosper us therefore we his servants will arise and build but ye have no portion nor right nor memorial in jerusalem
then eliashib the high priest rose up with his brethren the priests and they builded the sheep gate they sanctified it and set up the doors of it even unto the tower of meah they sanctified it unto the tower of hananeel
and next unto him builded the men of jericho and next to them builded zaccur the son of imri

after him repaired the levites rehum the son of bani next unto him repaired hashabiah the ruler of the half part of keilah in his part
after him repaired their brethren bavai the son of henadad the ruler of the half part of keilah
and next to him repaired ezer the son of jeshua the ruler of mizpah another piece over against the going up to the armoury at the turning of the wall
after him baruch the son of zabbai earnestly repaired the other piece from the turning of the wall unto the door of the house of eliashib the high priest

and between the going up of the corner unto the sheep gate repaired the goldsmiths and the merchants
but it came to pass that when sanballat heard that we builded the wall he was wroth and took great indignation and mocked the jews
and he spake before his brethren and the army of samaria and said what do these feeble jews will they fortify themselves will they sacrifice will they make an end in a day will they revive the stones out of the heaps of the rubbish which are burned
now tobiah the ammonite was by him and he said even that which they build if a fox go up he shall even break down their stone wall
hear o our god for we are despised and turn their reproach upon their own head and give them for a prey in the land of captivity
and cover not their iniquity and let not their sin be blotted out from before thee for they have provoked thee to anger before the builders
so built we the wall and all the wall was joined together unto the half thereof for the people had a mind to work
but it came to pass that when sanballat and tobiah and the arabians and the ammonites and the ashdodites heard that the walls of jerusalem were made up and that the breaches began to be stopped then they were very wroth
and conspired all of them together to come and to fight against jerusalem and to hinder it
nevertheless we made our prayer unto our god and set a watch against them day and night because of them
and judah said the strength of the bearers of burdens is decayed and there is much rubbish so that we are not able to build the wall
and our adversaries said they shall not know neither see till we come in the midst among them and slay them and cause the work to cease
and it came to pass that when the jews which dwelt by them came they said unto us ten times from all places whence ye shall return unto us they will be upon you
therefore set i in the lower places behind the wall and on the higher places i even set the people after their families with their swords their spears and their bows
and i looked and rose up and said unto the nobles and to the rulers and to the rest of the people be not ye afraid of them remember the lord which is great and terrible and fight for your brethren your sons and your daughters your wives and your houses
and it came to pass when our enemies heard that it was known unto us and god had brought their counsel to nought that we returned all of us to the wall every one unto his work
and it came to pass from that time forth that the half of my servants wrought in the work and the other half of them held both the spears the shields and the bows and the habergeons and the rulers were behind all the house of judah
they which builded on the wall and they that bare burdens with those that laded every one with one of his hands wrought in the work and with the other hand held a weapon
for the builders every one had his sword girded by his side and so builded and he that sounded the trumpet was by me
and i said unto the nobles and to the rulers and to the rest of the people the work is great and large and we are separated upon the wall one far from another
in what place therefore ye hear the sound of the trumpet resort ye thither unto us our god shall fight for us
so we laboured in the work and half of them held the spears from the rising of the morning till the stars appeared
likewise at the same time said i unto the people let every one with his servant lodge within jerusalem that in the night they may be a guard to us and labour on the day
so neither i nor my brethren nor my servants nor the men of the guard which followed me none of us put off our clothes saving that every one put them off for washing
and there was a great cry of the people and of their wives against their brethren the jews
for there were that said we our sons and our daughters are many therefore we take up corn for them that we may eat and live
some also there were that said we have mortgaged our lands vineyards and houses that we might buy corn because of the dearth
there were also that said we have borrowed money for the king's tribute and that upon our lands and vineyards
yet now our flesh is as the flesh of our brethren our children as their children and lo we bring into bondage our sons and our daughters to be servants and some of our daughters are brought unto bondage already neither is it in our power to redeem them for other men have our lands and vineyards
and i was very angry when i heard their cry and these words
then i consulted with myself and i rebuked the nobles and the rulers and said unto them ye exact usury every one of his brother and i set a great assembly against them
and i said unto them we after our ability have redeemed our brethren the jews which were sold unto the heathen and will ye even sell your brethren or shall they be sold unto us then held they their peace and found nothing to answer
also i said it is not good that ye do ought ye not to walk in the fear of our god because of the reproach of the heathen our enemies
i likewise and my brethren and my servants might exact of them money and corn i pray you let us leave off this usury
restore i pray you to them even this day their lands their vineyards their oliveyards and their houses also the hundredth part of the money and of the corn the wine and the oil that ye exact of them
then said they we will restore them and will require nothing of them so will we do as thou sayest then i called the priests and took an oath of them that they should do according to this promise
also i shook my lap and said so god shake out every man from his house and from his labour that performeth not this promise even thus be he shaken out and emptied and all the congregation said amen and praised the lord and the people did according to this promise
moreover from the time that i was appointed to be their governor in the land of judah from the twentieth year even unto the two and thirtieth year of artaxerxes the king that is twelve years i and my brethren have not eaten the bread of the governor
but the former governors that had been before me were chargeable unto the people and had taken of them bread and wine beside forty shekels of silver yea even their servants bare rule over the people but so did not i because of the fear of god
