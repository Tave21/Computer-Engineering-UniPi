then certain of the vagabond jews exorcists took upon them to call over them which had evil spirits the name of the lord jesus saying we adjure you by jesus whom paul preacheth
and there were seven sons of one sceva a jew and chief of the priests which did so
and the evil spirit answered and said jesus i know and paul i know but who are ye
and the man in whom the evil spirit was leaped on them and overcame them and prevailed against them so that they fled out of that house naked and wounded
and this was known to all the jews and greeks also dwelling at ephesus and fear fell on them all and the name of the lord jesus was magnified
and many that believed came and confessed and shewed their deeds
many of them also which used curious arts brought their books together and burned them before all men and they counted the price of them and found it fifty thousand pieces of silver
so mightily grew the word of god and prevailed
after these things were ended paul purposed in the spirit when he had passed through macedonia and achaia to go to jerusalem saying after i have been there i must also see rome
so he sent into macedonia two of them that ministered unto him timotheus and erastus but he himself stayed in asia for a season
and the same time there arose no small stir about that way
for a certain man named demetrius a silversmith which made silver shrines for diana brought no small gain unto the craftsmen
whom he called together with the workmen of like occupation and said sirs ye know that by this craft we have our wealth
moreover ye see and hear that not alone at ephesus but almost throughout all asia this paul hath persuaded and turned away much people saying that they be no gods which are made with hands
so that not only this our craft is in danger to be set at nought but also that the temple of the great goddess diana should be despised and her magnificence should be destroyed whom all asia and the world worshippeth
and when they heard these sayings they were full of wrath and cried out saying great is diana of the ephesians
and the whole city was filled with confusion and having caught gaius and aristarchus men of macedonia paul's companions in travel they rushed with one accord into the theatre
and when paul would have entered in unto the people the disciples suffered him not
and certain of the chief of asia which were his friends sent unto him desiring him that he would not adventure himself into the theatre
some therefore cried one thing and some another for the assembly was confused and the more part knew not wherefore they were come together
and they drew alexander out of the multitude the jews putting him forward and alexander beckoned with the hand and would have made his defence unto the people
but when they knew that he was a jew all with one voice about the space of two hours cried out great is diana of the ephesians
and when the townclerk had appeased the people he said ye men of ephesus what man is there that knoweth not how that the city of the ephesians is a worshipper of the great goddess diana and of the image which fell down from jupiter
seeing then that these things cannot be spoken against ye ought to be quiet and to do nothing rashly
for ye have brought hither these men which are neither robbers of churches nor yet blasphemers of your goddess
wherefore if demetrius and the craftsmen which are with him have a matter against any man the law is open and there are deputies let them implead one another
but if ye enquire any thing concerning other matters it shall be determined in a lawful assembly
for we are in danger to be called in question for this day's uproar there being no cause whereby we may give an account of this concourse
and when he had thus spoken he dismissed the assembly
and after the uproar was ceased paul called unto him the disciples and embraced them and departed for to go into macedonia
and when he had gone over those parts and had given them much exhortation he came into greece
and there abode three months and when the jews laid wait for him as he was about to sail into syria he purposed to return through macedonia
and there accompanied him into asia sopater of berea and of the thessalonians aristarchus and secundus and gaius of derbe and timotheus and of asia tychicus and trophimus
these going before tarried for us at troas
and we sailed away from philippi after the days of unleavened bread and came unto them to troas in five days where we abode seven days
and upon the first day of the week when the disciples came together to break bread paul preached unto them ready to depart on the morrow and continued his speech until midnight
and there were many lights in the upper chamber where they were gathered together
and there sat in a window a certain young man named eutychus being fallen into a deep sleep and as paul was long preaching he sunk down with sleep and fell down from the third loft and was taken up dead
and paul went down and fell on him and embracing him said trouble not yourselves for his life is in him
when he therefore was come up again and had broken bread and eaten and talked a long while even till break of day so he departed
and they brought the young man alive and were not a little comforted
and we went before to ship and sailed unto assos there intending to take in paul for so had he appointed minding himself to go afoot
and when he met with us at assos we took him in and came to mitylene
and we sailed thence and came the next day over against chios and the next day we arrived at samos and tarried at trogyllium and the next day we came to miletus
for paul had determined to sail by ephesus because he would not spend the time in asia for he hasted if it were possible for him to be at jerusalem the day of pentecost
and from miletus he sent to ephesus and called the elders of the church
and when they were come to him he said unto them ye know from the first day that i came into asia after what manner i have been with you at all seasons
serving the lord with all humility of mind and with many tears and temptations which befell me by the lying in wait of the jews
and how i kept back nothing that was profitable unto you but have shewed you and have taught you publickly and from house to house
testifying both to the jews and also to the greeks repentance toward god and faith toward our lord jesus christ
and now behold i go bound in the spirit unto jerusalem not knowing the things that shall befall me there
save that the holy ghost witnesseth in every city saying that bonds and afflictions abide me
but none of these things move me neither count i my life dear unto myself so that i might finish my course with joy and the ministry which i have received of the lord jesus to testify the gospel of the grace of god
and now behold i know that ye all among whom i have gone preaching the kingdom of god shall see my face no more
wherefore i take you to record this day that i am pure from the blood of all men
for i have not shunned to declare unto you all the counsel of god
take heed therefore unto yourselves and to all the flock over the which the holy ghost hath made you overseers to feed the church of god which he hath purchased with his own blood
for i know this that after my departing shall grievous wolves enter in among you not sparing the flock
also of your own selves shall men arise speaking perverse things to draw away disciples after them
therefore watch and remember that by the space of three years i ceased not to warn every one night and day with tears
and now brethren i commend you to god and to the word of his grace which is able to build you up and to give you an inheritance among all them which are sanctified
i have coveted no man's silver or gold or apparel
yea ye yourselves know that these hands have ministered unto my necessities and to them that were with me
i have shewed you all things how that so labouring ye ought to support the weak and to remember the words of the lord jesus how he said it is more blessed to give than to receive
and when he had thus spoken he kneeled down and prayed with them all
and they all wept sore and fell on paul's neck and kissed him
sorrowing most of all for the words which he spake that they should see his face no more and they accompanied him unto the ship
and it came to pass that after we were gotten from them and had launched we came with a straight course unto coos and the day following unto rhodes and from thence unto patara
and finding a ship sailing over unto phenicia we went aboard and set forth
now when we had discovered cyprus we left it on the left hand and sailed into syria and landed at tyre for there the ship was to unlade her burden
and finding disciples we tarried there seven days who said to paul through the spirit that he should not go up to jerusalem
and when we had accomplished those days we departed and went our way and they all brought us on our way with wives and children till we were out of the city and we kneeled down on the shore and prayed
and when we had taken our leave one of another we took ship and they returned home again
and when we had finished our course from tyre we came to ptolemais and saluted the brethren and abode with them one day
and the next day we that were of paul's company departed and came unto caesarea and we entered into the house of philip the evangelist which was one of the seven and abode with him
and the same man had four daughters virgins which did prophesy
and as we tarried there many days there came down from judaea a certain prophet named agabus
and when he was come unto us he took paul's girdle and bound his own hands and feet and said thus saith the holy ghost so shall the jews at jerusalem bind the man that owneth this girdle and shall deliver him into the hands of the gentiles
and when we heard these things both we and they of that place besought him not to go up to jerusalem
then paul answered what mean ye to weep and to break mine heart for i am ready not to be bound only but also to die at jerusalem for the name of the lord jesus
and when he would not be persuaded we ceased saying the will of the lord be done
and after those days we took up our carriages and went up to jerusalem
there went with us also certain of the disciples of caesarea and brought with them one mnason of cyprus an old disciple with whom we should lodge
and when we were come to jerusalem the brethren received us gladly
and the day following paul went in with us unto james and all the elders were present
and when he had saluted them he declared particularly what things god had wrought among the gentiles by his ministry
and when they heard it they glorified the lord and said unto him thou seest brother how many thousands of jews there are which believe and they are all zealous of the law
and they are informed of thee that thou teachest all the jews which are among the gentiles to forsake moses saying that they ought not to circumcise their children neither to walk after the customs
what is it therefore the multitude must needs come together for they will hear that thou art come
do therefore this that we say to thee we have four men which have a vow on them
them take and purify thyself with them and be at charges with them that they may shave their heads and all may know that those things whereof they were informed concerning thee are nothing but that thou thyself also walkest orderly and keepest the law
as touching the gentiles which believe we have written and concluded that they observe no such thing save only that they keep themselves from things offered to idols and from blood and from strangled and from fornication
then paul took the men and the next day purifying himself with them entered into the temple to signify the accomplishment of the days of purification until that an offering should be offered for every one of them
and when the seven days were almost ended the jews which were of asia when they saw him in the temple stirred up all the people and laid hands on him
crying out men of israel help this is the man that teacheth all men every where against the people and the law and this place and further brought greeks also into the temple and hath polluted this holy place
for they had seen before with him in the city trophimus an ephesian whom they supposed that paul had brought into the temple
and all the city was moved and the people ran together and they took paul and drew him out of the temple and forthwith the doors were shut
and as they went about to kill him tidings came unto the chief captain of the band that all jerusalem was in an uproar
who immediately took soldiers and centurions and ran down unto them and when they saw the chief captain and the soldiers they left beating of paul
then the chief captain came near and took him and commanded him to be bound with two chains and demanded who he was and what he had done
and some cried one thing some another among the multitude and when he could not know the certainty for the tumult he commanded him to be carried into the castle
and when he came upon the stairs so it was that he was borne of the soldiers for the violence of the people
for the multitude of the people followed after crying away with him
and as paul was to be led into the castle he said unto the chief captain may i speak unto thee who said canst thou speak greek
art not thou that egyptian which before these days madest an uproar and leddest out into the wilderness four thousand men that were murderers
but paul said i am a man which am a jew of tarsus a city in cilicia a citizen of no mean city and i beseech thee suffer me to speak unto the people
and when he had given him licence paul stood on the stairs and beckoned with the hand unto the people and when there was made a great silence he spake unto them in the hebrew tongue saying
men brethren and fathers hear ye my defence which i make now unto you
and when they heard that he spake in the hebrew tongue to them they kept the more silence and he saith
i am verily a man which am a jew born in tarsus a city in cilicia yet brought up in this city at the feet of gamaliel and taught according to the perfect manner of the law of the fathers and was zealous toward god as ye all are this day
and i persecuted this way unto the death binding and delivering into prisons both men and women
as also the high priest doth bear me witness and all the estate of the elders from whom also i received letters unto the brethren and went to damascus to bring them which were there bound unto jerusalem for to be punished
and it came to pass that as i made my journey and was come nigh unto damascus about noon suddenly there shone from heaven a great light round about me
and i fell unto the ground and heard a voice saying unto me saul saul why persecutest thou me
and i answered who art thou lord and he said unto me i am jesus of nazareth whom thou persecutest
and they that were with me saw indeed the light and were afraid but they heard not the voice of him that spake to me
and i said what shall i do lord and the lord said unto me arise and go into damascus and there it shall be told thee of all things which are appointed for thee to do
and when i could not see for the glory of that light being led by the hand of them that were with me i came into damascus
and one ananias a devout man according to the law having a good report of all the jews which dwelt there
came unto me and stood and said unto me brother saul receive thy sight and the same hour i looked up upon him
and he said the god of our fathers hath chosen thee that thou shouldest know his will and see that just one and shouldest hear the voice of his mouth
for thou shalt be his witness unto all men of what thou hast seen and heard
and now why tarriest thou arise and be baptized and wash away thy sins calling on the name of the lord
and it came to pass that when i was come again to jerusalem even while i prayed in the temple i was in a trance
and saw him saying unto me make haste and get thee quickly out of jerusalem for they will not receive thy testimony concerning me
and i said lord they know that i imprisoned and beat in every synagogue them that believed on thee
and when the blood of thy martyr stephen was shed i also was standing by and consenting unto his death and kept the raiment of them that slew him
and he said unto me depart for i will send thee far hence unto the gentiles
and they gave him audience unto this word and then lifted up their voices and said away with such a fellow from the earth for it is not fit that he should live
and as they cried out and cast off their clothes and threw dust into the air
the chief captain commanded him to be brought into the castle and bade that he should be examined by scourging that he might know wherefore they cried so against him
and as they bound him with thongs paul said unto the centurion that stood by is it lawful for you to scourge a man that is a roman and uncondemned
when the centurion heard that he went and told the chief captain saying take heed what thou doest for this man is a roman
then the chief captain came and said unto him tell me art thou a roman he said yea
and the chief captain answered with a great sum obtained i this freedom and paul said but i was free born
then straightway they departed from him which should have examined him and the chief captain also was afraid after he knew that he was a roman and because he had bound him
on the morrow because he would have known the certainty wherefore he was accused of the jews he loosed him from his bands and commanded the chief priests and all their council to appear and brought paul down and set him before them
and paul earnestly beholding the council said men and brethren i have lived in all good conscience before god until this day
and the high priest ananias commanded them that stood by him to smite him on the mouth
then said paul unto him god shall smite thee thou whited wall for sittest thou to judge me after the law and commandest me to be smitten contrary to the law
and they that stood by said revilest thou god's high priest
then said paul i wist not brethren that he was the high priest for it is written thou shalt not speak evil of the ruler of thy people
but when paul perceived that the one part were sadducees and the other pharisees he cried out in the council men and brethren i am a pharisee the son of a pharisee of the hope and resurrection of the dead i am called in question
and when he had so said there arose a dissension between the pharisees and the sadducees and the multitude was divided
for the sadducees say that there is no resurrection neither angel nor spirit but the pharisees confess both
and there arose a great cry and the scribes that were of the pharisees part arose and strove saying we find no evil in this man but if a spirit or an angel hath spoken to him let us not fight against god
and when there arose a great dissension the chief captain fearing lest paul should have been pulled in pieces of them commanded the soldiers to go down and to take him by force from among them and to bring him into the castle
and the night following the lord stood by him and said be of good cheer paul for as thou hast testified of me in jerusalem so must thou bear witness also at rome
and when it was day certain of the jews banded together and bound themselves under a curse saying that they would neither eat nor drink till they had killed paul
and they were more than forty which had made this conspiracy
and they came to the chief priests and elders and said we have bound ourselves under a great curse that we will eat nothing until we have slain paul
now therefore ye with the council signify to the chief captain that he bring him down unto you to morrow as though ye would enquire something more perfectly concerning him and we or ever he come near are ready to kill him
and when paul's sister's son heard of their lying in wait he went and entered into the castle and told paul
then paul called one of the centurions unto him and said bring this young man unto the chief captain for he hath a certain thing to tell him
so he took him and brought him to the chief captain and said paul the prisoner called me unto him and prayed me to bring this young man unto thee who hath something to say unto thee
then the chief captain took him by the hand and went with him aside privately and asked him what is that thou hast to tell me
and he said the jews have agreed to desire thee that thou wouldest bring down paul to morrow into the council as though they would enquire somewhat of him more perfectly
but do not thou yield unto them for there lie in wait for him of them more than forty men which have bound themselves with an oath that they will neither eat nor drink till they have killed him and now are they ready looking for a promise from thee
so the chief captain then let the young man depart and charged him see thou tell no man that thou hast shewed these things to me
and he called unto him two centurions saying make ready two hundred soldiers to go to caesarea and horsemen threescore and ten and spearmen two hundred at the third hour of the night
and provide them beasts that they may set paul on and bring him safe unto felix the governor
and he wrote a letter after this manner
claudius lysias unto the most excellent governor felix sendeth greeting
this man was taken of the jews and should have been killed of them then came i with an army and rescued him having understood that he was a roman
and when i would have known the cause wherefore they accused him i brought him forth into their council
whom i perceived to be accused of questions of their law but to have nothing laid to his charge worthy of death or of bonds
and when it was told me how that the jews laid wait for the man i sent straightway to thee and gave commandment to his accusers also to say before thee what they had against him farewell
then the soldiers as it was commanded them took paul and brought him by night to antipatris
on the morrow they left the horsemen to go with him and returned to the castle
who when they came to caesarea and delivered the epistle to the governor presented paul also before him
and when the governor had read the letter he asked of what province he was and when he understood that he was of cilicia
i will hear thee said he when thine accusers are also come and he commanded him to be kept in herod's judgment hall
and after five days ananias the high priest descended with the elders and with a certain orator named tertullus who informed the governor against paul
and when he was called forth tertullus began to accuse him saying seeing that by thee we enjoy great quietness and that very worthy deeds are done unto this nation by thy providence
we accept it always and in all places most noble felix with all thankfulness
notwithstanding that i be not further tedious unto thee i pray thee that thou wouldest hear us of thy clemency a few words
for we have found this man a pestilent fellow and a mover of sedition among all the jews throughout the world and a ringleader of the sect of the nazarenes
who also hath gone about to profane the temple whom we took and would have judged according to our law
but the chief captain lysias came upon us and with great violence took him away out of our hands
commanding his accusers to come unto thee by examining of whom thyself mayest take knowledge of all these things whereof we accuse him
and the jews also assented saying that these things were so
then paul after that the governor had beckoned unto him to speak answered forasmuch as i know that thou hast been of many years a judge unto this nation i do the more cheerfully answer for myself
because that thou mayest understand that there are yet but twelve days since i went up to jerusalem for to worship
and they neither found me in the temple disputing with any man neither raising up the people neither in the synagogues nor in the city
neither can they prove the things whereof they now accuse me
but this i confess unto thee that after the way which they call heresy so worship i the god of my fathers believing all things which are written in the law and in the prophets
and have hope toward god which they themselves also allow that there shall be a resurrection of the dead both of the just and unjust
and herein do i exercise myself to have always a conscience void of offence toward god and toward men
now after many years i came to bring alms to my nation and offerings
whereupon certain jews from asia found me purified in the temple neither with multitude nor with tumult
who ought to have been here before thee and object if they had ought against me
or else let these same here say if they have found any evil doing in me while i stood before the council
except it be for this one voice that i cried standing among them touching the resurrection of the dead i am called in question by you this day
and when felix heard these things having more perfect knowledge of that way he deferred them and said when lysias the chief captain shall come down i will know the uttermost of your matter
and he commanded a centurion to keep paul and to let him have liberty and that he should forbid none of his acquaintance to minister or come unto him
and after certain days when felix came with his wife drusilla which was a jewess he sent for paul and heard him concerning the faith in christ
and as he reasoned of righteousness temperance and judgment to come felix trembled and answered go thy way for this time when i have a convenient season i will call for thee
he hoped also that money should have been given him of paul that he might loose him wherefore he sent for him the oftener and communed with him
but after two years porcius festus came into felix room and felix willing to shew the jews a pleasure left paul bound
now when festus was come into the province after three days he ascended from caesarea to jerusalem
