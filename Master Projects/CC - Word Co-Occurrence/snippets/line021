and when moses heard it he fell upon his face
and he spake unto korah and unto all his company saying even to morrow the lord will shew who are his and who is holy and will cause him to come near unto him even him whom he hath chosen will he cause to come near unto him
this do take you censers korah and all his company
and put fire therein and put incense in them before the lord to morrow and it shall be that the man whom the lord doth choose he shall be holy ye take too much upon you ye sons of levi
and moses said unto korah hear i pray you ye sons of levi
seemeth it but a small thing unto you that the god of israel hath separated you from the congregation of israel to bring you near to himself to do the service of the tabernacle of the lord and to stand before the congregation to minister unto them
and he hath brought thee near to him and all thy brethren the sons of levi with thee and seek ye the priesthood also
for which cause both thou and all thy company are gathered together against the lord and what is aaron that ye murmur against him
and moses sent to call dathan and abiram the sons of eliab which said we will not come up
is it a small thing that thou hast brought us up out of a land that floweth with milk and honey to kill us in the wilderness except thou make thyself altogether a prince over us
moreover thou hast not brought us into a land that floweth with milk and honey or given us inheritance of fields and vineyards wilt thou put out the eyes of these men we will not come up
and moses was very wroth and said unto the lord respect not thou their offering i have not taken one ass from them neither have i hurt one of them
and moses said unto korah be thou and all thy company before the lord thou and they and aaron to morrow
and take every man his censer and put incense in them and bring ye before the lord every man his censer two hundred and fifty censers thou also and aaron each of you his censer
and they took every man his censer and put fire in them and laid incense thereon and stood in the door of the tabernacle of the congregation with moses and aaron
and korah gathered all the congregation against them unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation and the glory of the lord appeared unto all the congregation
and the lord spake unto moses and unto aaron saying
separate yourselves from among this congregation that i may consume them in a moment
and they fell upon their faces and said o god the god of the spirits of all flesh shall one man sin and wilt thou be wroth with all the congregation
and the lord spake unto moses saying
speak unto the congregation saying get you up from about the tabernacle of korah dathan and abiram
and moses rose up and went unto dathan and abiram and the elders of israel followed him
and he spake unto the congregation saying depart i pray you from the tents of these wicked men and touch nothing of theirs lest ye be consumed in all their sins
so they gat up from the tabernacle of korah dathan and abiram on every side and dathan and abiram came out and stood in the door of their tents and their wives and their sons and their little children
and moses said hereby ye shall know that the lord hath sent me to do all these works for i have not done them of mine own mind
if these men die the common death of all men or if they be visited after the visitation of all men then the lord hath not sent me
but if the lord make a new thing and the earth open her mouth and swallow them up with all that appertain unto them and they go down quick into the pit then ye shall understand that these men have provoked the lord
and it came to pass as he had made an end of speaking all these words that the ground clave asunder that was under them
and the earth opened her mouth and swallowed them up and their houses and all the men that appertained unto korah and all their goods
they and all that appertained to them went down alive into the pit and the earth closed upon them and they perished from among the congregation
and all israel that were round about them fled at the cry of them for they said lest the earth swallow us up also
and there came out a fire from the lord and consumed the two hundred and fifty men that offered incense
and the lord spake unto moses saying
speak unto eleazar the son of aaron the priest that he take up the censers out of the burning and scatter thou the fire yonder for they are hallowed
the censers of these sinners against their own souls let them make them broad plates for a covering of the altar for they offered them before the lord therefore they are hallowed and they shall be a sign unto the children of israel
and eleazar the priest took the brasen censers wherewith they that were burnt had offered and they were made broad plates for a covering of the altar
to be a memorial unto the children of israel that no stranger which is not of the seed of aaron come near to offer incense before the lord that he be not as korah and as his company as the lord said to him by the hand of moses
but on the morrow all the congregation of the children of israel murmured against moses and against aaron saying ye have killed the people of the lord
and it came to pass when the congregation was gathered against moses and against aaron that they looked toward the tabernacle of the congregation and behold the cloud covered it and the glory of the lord appeared
and moses and aaron came before the tabernacle of the congregation
and the lord spake unto moses saying
get you up from among this congregation that i may consume them as in a moment and they fell upon their faces
and moses said unto aaron take a censer and put fire therein from off the altar and put on incense and go quickly unto the congregation and make an atonement for them for there is wrath gone out from the lord the plague is begun
and aaron took as moses commanded and ran into the midst of the congregation and behold the plague was begun among the people and he put on incense and made an atonement for the people
and he stood between the dead and the living and the plague was stayed
now they that died in the plague were fourteen thousand and seven hundred beside them that died about the matter of korah
and aaron returned unto moses unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation and the plague was stayed
and the lord spake unto moses saying
speak unto the children of israel and take of every one of them a rod according to the house of their fathers of all their princes according to the house of their fathers twelve rods write thou every man's name upon his rod
and thou shalt write aaron's name upon the rod of levi for one rod shall be for the head of the house of their fathers
and thou shalt lay them up in the tabernacle of the congregation before the testimony where i will meet with you
and it shall come to pass that the man's rod whom i shall choose shall blossom and i will make to cease from me the murmurings of the children of israel whereby they murmur against you
and moses spake unto the children of israel and every one of their princes gave him a rod apiece for each prince one according to their fathers houses even twelve rods and the rod of aaron was among their rods
and moses laid up the rods before the lord in the tabernacle of witness
and it came to pass that on the morrow moses went into the tabernacle of witness and behold the rod of aaron for the house of levi was budded and brought forth buds and bloomed blossoms and yielded almonds
and moses brought out all the rods from before the lord unto all the children of israel and they looked and took every man his rod
and the lord said unto moses bring aaron's rod again before the testimony to be kept for a token against the rebels and thou shalt quite take away their murmurings from me that they die not
and moses did so as the lord commanded him so did he
and the children of israel spake unto moses saying behold we die we perish we all perish
whosoever cometh any thing near unto the tabernacle of the lord shall die shall we be consumed with dying
and the lord said unto aaron thou and thy sons and thy father's house with thee shall bear the iniquity of the sanctuary and thou and thy sons with thee shall bear the iniquity of your priesthood
and thy brethren also of the tribe of levi the tribe of thy father bring thou with thee that they may be joined unto thee and minister unto thee but thou and thy sons with thee shall minister before the tabernacle of witness
and they shall keep thy charge and the charge of all the tabernacle only they shall not come nigh the vessels of the sanctuary and the altar that neither they nor ye also die
and they shall be joined unto thee and keep the charge of the tabernacle of the congregation for all the service of the tabernacle and a stranger shall not come nigh unto you
and ye shall keep the charge of the sanctuary and the charge of the altar that there be no wrath any more upon the children of israel
and i behold i have taken your brethren the levites from among the children of israel to you they are given as a gift for the lord to do the service of the tabernacle of the congregation
therefore thou and thy sons with thee shall keep your priest's office for everything of the altar and within the vail and ye shall serve i have given your priest's office unto you as a service of gift and the stranger that cometh nigh shall be put to death
and the lord spake unto aaron behold i also have given thee the charge of mine heave offerings of all the hallowed things of the children of israel unto thee have i given them by reason of the anointing and to thy sons by an ordinance for ever
this shall be thine of the most holy things reserved from the fire every oblation of theirs every meat offering of theirs and every sin offering of theirs and every trespass offering of theirs which they shall render unto me shall be most holy for thee and for thy sons
in the most holy place shalt thou eat it every male shall eat it it shall be holy unto thee
and this is thine the heave offering of their gift with all the wave offerings of the children of israel i have given them unto thee and to thy sons and to thy daughters with thee by a statute for ever every one that is clean in thy house shall eat of it
all the best of the oil and all the best of the wine and of the wheat the firstfruits of them which they shall offer unto the lord them have i given thee
and whatsoever is first ripe in the land which they shall bring unto the lord shall be thine every one that is clean in thine house shall eat of it
every thing devoted in israel shall be thine
every thing that openeth the matrix in all flesh which they bring unto the lord whether it be of men or beasts shall be thine nevertheless the firstborn of man shalt thou surely redeem and the firstling of unclean beasts shalt thou redeem
and those that are to be redeemed from a month old shalt thou redeem according to thine estimation for the money of five shekels after the shekel of the sanctuary which is twenty gerahs
but the firstling of a cow or the firstling of a sheep or the firstling of a goat thou shalt not redeem they are holy thou shalt sprinkle their blood upon the altar and shalt burn their fat for an offering made by fire for a sweet savour unto the lord
and the flesh of them shall be thine as the wave breast and as the right shoulder are thine
all the heave offerings of the holy things which the children of israel offer unto the lord have i given thee and thy sons and thy daughters with thee by a statute for ever it is a covenant of salt for ever before the lord unto thee and to thy seed with thee
and the lord spake unto aaron thou shalt have no inheritance in their land neither shalt thou have any part among them i am thy part and thine inheritance among the children of israel
and behold i have given the children of levi all the tenth in israel for an inheritance for their service which they serve even the service of the tabernacle of the congregation
neither must the children of israel henceforth come nigh the tabernacle of the congregation lest they bear sin and die
but the levites shall do the service of the tabernacle of the congregation and they shall bear their iniquity it shall be a statute for ever throughout your generations that among the children of israel they have no inheritance
but the tithes of the children of israel which they offer as an heave offering unto the lord i have given to the levites to inherit therefore i have said unto them among the children of israel they shall have no inheritance
and the lord spake unto moses saying
thus speak unto the levites and say unto them when ye take of the children of israel the tithes which i have given you from them for your inheritance then ye shall offer up an heave offering of it for the lord even a tenth part of the tithe
and this your heave offering shall be reckoned unto you as though it were the corn of the threshingfloor and as the fulness of the winepress
thus ye also shall offer an heave offering unto the lord of all your tithes which ye receive of the children of israel and ye shall give thereof the lord's heave offering to aaron the priest
out of all your gifts ye shall offer every heave offering of the lord of all the best thereof even the hallowed part thereof out of it
therefore thou shalt say unto them when ye have heaved the best thereof from it then it shall be counted unto the levites as the increase of the threshingfloor and as the increase of the winepress
and ye shall eat it in every place ye and your households for it is your reward for your service in the tabernacle of the congregation
and ye shall bear no sin by reason of it when ye have heaved from it the best of it neither shall ye pollute the holy things of the children of israel lest ye die
and the lord spake unto moses and unto aaron saying
this is the ordinance of the law which the lord hath commanded saying speak unto the children of israel that they bring thee a red heifer without spot wherein is no blemish and upon which never came yoke
and ye shall give her unto eleazar the priest that he may bring her forth without the camp and one shall slay her before his face
and eleazar the priest shall take of her blood with his finger and sprinkle of her blood directly before the tabernacle of the congregation seven times
and one shall burn the heifer in his sight her skin and her flesh and her blood with her dung shall he burn
and the priest shall take cedar wood and hyssop and scarlet and cast it into the midst of the burning of the heifer
then the priest shall wash his clothes and he shall bathe his flesh in water and afterward he shall come into the camp and the priest shall be unclean until the even
and he that burneth her shall wash his clothes in water and bathe his flesh in water and shall be unclean until the even
and a man that is clean shall gather up the ashes of the heifer and lay them up without the camp in a clean place and it shall be kept for the congregation of the children of israel for a water of separation it is a purification for sin
and he that gathereth the ashes of the heifer shall wash his clothes and be unclean until the even and it shall be unto the children of israel and unto the stranger that sojourneth among them for a statute for ever
he that toucheth the dead body of any man shall be unclean seven days
he shall purify himself with it on the third day and on the seventh day he shall be clean but if he purify not himself the third day then the seventh day he shall not be clean
whosoever toucheth the dead body of any man that is dead and purifieth not himself defileth the tabernacle of the lord and that soul shall be cut off from israel because the water of separation was not sprinkled upon him he shall be unclean his uncleanness is yet upon him
this is the law when a man dieth in a tent all that come into the tent and all that is in the tent shall be unclean seven days
and every open vessel which hath no covering bound upon it is unclean
and whosoever toucheth one that is slain with a sword in the open fields or a dead body or a bone of a man or a grave shall be unclean seven days
and for an unclean person they shall take of the ashes of the burnt heifer of purification for sin and running water shall be put thereto in a vessel
and a clean person shall take hyssop and dip it in the water and sprinkle it upon the tent and upon all the vessels and upon the persons that were there and upon him that touched a bone or one slain or one dead or a grave
and the clean person shall sprinkle upon the unclean on the third day and on the seventh day and on the seventh day he shall purify himself and wash his clothes and bathe himself in water and shall be clean at even
but the man that shall be unclean and shall not purify himself that soul shall be cut off from among the congregation because he hath defiled the sanctuary of the lord the water of separation hath not been sprinkled upon him he is unclean
and it shall be a perpetual statute unto them that he that sprinkleth the water of separation shall wash his clothes and he that toucheth the water of separation shall be unclean until even
and whatsoever the unclean person toucheth shall be unclean and the soul that toucheth it shall be unclean until even
then came the children of israel even the whole congregation into the desert of zin in the first month and the people abode in kadesh and miriam died there and was buried there
and there was no water for the congregation and they gathered themselves together against moses and against aaron
and the people chode with moses and spake saying would god that we had died when our brethren died before the lord
and why have ye brought up the congregation of the lord into this wilderness that we and our cattle should die there
and wherefore have ye made us to come up out of egypt to bring us in unto this evil place it is no place of seed or of figs or of vines or of pomegranates neither is there any water to drink
and moses and aaron went from the presence of the assembly unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation and they fell upon their faces and the glory of the lord appeared unto them
and the lord spake unto moses saying
take the rod and gather thou the assembly together thou and aaron thy brother and speak ye unto the rock before their eyes and it shall give forth his water and thou shalt bring forth to them water out of the rock so thou shalt give the congregation and their beasts drink
and moses took the rod from before the lord as he commanded him
and moses and aaron gathered the congregation together before the rock and he said unto them hear now ye rebels must we fetch you water out of this rock
and moses lifted up his hand and with his rod he smote the rock twice and the water came out abundantly and the congregation drank and their beasts also
and the lord spake unto moses and aaron because ye believed me not to sanctify me in the eyes of the children of israel therefore ye shall not bring this congregation into the land which i have given them
this is the water of meribah because the children of israel strove with the lord and he was sanctified in them
and moses sent messengers from kadesh unto the king of edom thus saith thy brother israel thou knowest all the travail that hath befallen us
how our fathers went down into egypt and we have dwelt in egypt a long time and the egyptians vexed us and our fathers
and when we cried unto the lord he heard our voice and sent an angel and hath brought us forth out of egypt and behold we are in kadesh a city in the uttermost of thy border
let us pass i pray thee through thy country we will not pass through the fields or through the vineyards neither will we drink of the water of the wells we will go by the king's high way we will not turn to the right hand nor to the left until we have passed thy borders
and edom said unto him thou shalt not pass by me lest i come out against thee with the sword
and the children of israel said unto him we will go by the high way and if i and my cattle drink of thy water then i will pay for it i will only without doing anything else go through on my feet
and he said thou shalt not go through and edom came out against him with much people and with a strong hand
thus edom refused to give israel passage through his border wherefore israel turned away from him
and the children of israel even the whole congregation journeyed from kadesh and came unto mount hor
and the lord spake unto moses and aaron in mount hor by the coast of the land of edom saying
aaron shall be gathered unto his people for he shall not enter into the land which i have given unto the children of israel because ye rebelled against my word at the water of meribah
take aaron and eleazar his son and bring them up unto mount hor
and strip aaron of his garments and put them upon eleazar his son and aaron shall be gathered unto his people and shall die there
and moses did as the lord commanded and they went up into mount hor in the sight of all the congregation
and moses stripped aaron of his garments and put them upon eleazar his son and aaron died there in the top of the mount and moses and eleazar came down from the mount
and when all the congregation saw that aaron was dead they mourned for aaron thirty days even all the house of israel
and when king arad the canaanite which dwelt in the south heard tell that israel came by the way of the spies then he fought against israel and took some of them prisoners
and israel vowed a vow unto the lord and said if thou wilt indeed deliver this people into my hand then i will utterly destroy their cities
and the lord hearkened to the voice of israel and delivered up the canaanites and they utterly destroyed them and their cities and he called the name of the place hormah
and they journeyed from mount hor by the way of the red sea to compass the land of edom and the soul of the people was much discouraged because of the way
and the people spake against god and against moses wherefore have ye brought us up out of egypt to die in the wilderness for there is no bread neither is there any water and our soul loatheth this light bread
and the lord sent fiery serpents among the people and they bit the people and much people of israel died
therefore the people came to moses and said we have sinned for we have spoken against the lord and against thee pray unto the lord that he take away the serpents from us and moses prayed for the people
and the lord said unto moses make thee a fiery serpent and set it upon a pole and it shall come to pass that every one that is bitten when he looketh upon it shall live
and moses made a serpent of brass and put it upon a pole and it came to pass that if a serpent had bitten any man when he beheld the serpent of brass he lived
and the children of israel set forward and pitched in oboth
and they journeyed from oboth and pitched at ijeabarim in the wilderness which is before moab toward the sunrising
from thence they removed and pitched in the valley of zared
from thence they removed and pitched on the other side of arnon which is in the wilderness that cometh out of the coasts of the amorites for arnon is the border of moab between moab and the amorites
wherefore it is said in the book of the wars of the lord what he did in the red sea and in the brooks of arnon
and at the stream of the brooks that goeth down to the dwelling of ar and lieth upon the border of moab
and from thence they went to beer that is the well whereof the lord spake unto moses gather the people together and i will give them water
then israel sang this song spring up o well sing ye unto it
the princes digged the well the nobles of the people digged it by the direction of the lawgiver with their staves and from the wilderness they went to mattanah
and from mattanah to nahaliel and from nahaliel to bamoth
and from bamoth in the valley that is in the country of moab to the top of pisgah which looketh toward jeshimon
and israel sent messengers unto sihon king of the amorites saying
let me pass through thy land we will not turn into the fields or into the vineyards we will not drink of the waters of the well but we will go along by the king's high way until we be past thy borders
and sihon would not suffer israel to pass through his border but sihon gathered all his people together and went out against israel into the wilderness and he came to jahaz and fought against israel
and israel smote him with the edge of the sword and possessed his land from arnon unto jabbok even unto the children of ammon for the border of the children of ammon was strong
and israel took all these cities and israel dwelt in all the cities of the amorites in heshbon and in all the villages thereof
for heshbon was the city of sihon the king of the amorites who had fought against the former king of moab and taken all his land out of his hand even unto arnon
wherefore they that speak in proverbs say come into heshbon let the city of sihon be built and prepared
for there is a fire gone out of heshbon a flame from the city of sihon it hath consumed ar of moab and the lords of the high places of arnon
woe to thee moab thou art undone o people of chemosh he hath given his sons that escaped and his daughters into captivity unto sihon king of the amorites
we have shot at them heshbon is perished even unto dibon and we have laid them waste even unto nophah which reacheth unto medeba
thus israel dwelt in the land of the amorites
and moses sent to spy out jaazer and they took the villages thereof and drove out the amorites that were there
and they turned and went up by the way of bashan and og the king of bashan went out against them he and all his people to the battle at edrei
and the lord said unto moses fear him not for i have delivered him into thy hand and all his people and his land and thou shalt do to him as thou didst unto sihon king of the amorites which dwelt at heshbon
so they smote him and his sons and all his people until there was none left him alive and they possessed his land
and the children of israel set forward and pitched in the plains of moab on this side jordan by jericho
and balak the son of zippor saw all that israel had done to the amorites
and moab was sore afraid of the people because they were many and moab was distressed because of the children of israel
and moab said unto the elders of midian now shall this company lick up all that are round about us as the ox licketh up the grass of the field and balak the son of zippor was king of the moabites at that time
he sent messengers therefore unto balaam the son of beor to pethor which is by the river of the land of the children of his people to call him saying behold there is a people come out from egypt behold they cover the face of the earth and they abide over against me
come now therefore i pray thee curse me this people for they are too mighty for me peradventure i shall prevail that we may smite them and that i may drive them out of the land for i wot that he whom thou blessest is blessed and he whom thou cursest is cursed
and the elders of moab and the elders of midian departed with the rewards of divination in their hand and they came unto balaam and spake unto him the words of balak
and he said unto them lodge here this night and i will bring you word again as the lord shall speak unto me and the princes of moab abode with balaam
and god came unto balaam and said what men are these with thee
and balaam said unto god balak the son of zippor king of moab hath sent unto me saying
behold there is a people come out of egypt which covereth the face of the earth come now curse me them peradventure i shall be able to overcome them and drive them out
and god said unto balaam thou shalt not go with them thou shalt not curse the people for they are blessed
and balaam rose up in the morning and said unto the princes of balak get you into your land for the lord refuseth to give me leave to go with you
and the princes of moab rose up and they went unto balak and said balaam refuseth to come with us
and balak sent yet again princes more and more honourable than they
and they came to balaam and said to him thus saith balak the son of zippor let nothing i pray thee hinder thee from coming unto me
for i will promote thee unto very great honour and i will do whatsoever thou sayest unto me come therefore i pray thee curse me this people
and balaam answered and said unto the servants of balak if balak would give me his house full of silver and gold i cannot go beyond the word of the lord my god to do less or more
now therefore i pray you tarry ye also here this night that i may know what the lord will say unto me more
and god came unto balaam at night and said unto him if the men come to call thee rise up and go with them but yet the word which i shall say unto thee that shalt thou do
and balaam rose up in the morning and saddled his ass and went with the princes of moab
and god's anger was kindled because he went and the angel of the lord stood in the way for an adversary against him now he was riding upon his ass and his two servants were with him
