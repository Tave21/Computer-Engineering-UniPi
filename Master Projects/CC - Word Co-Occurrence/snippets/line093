hearken unto me ye stouthearted that are far from righteousness
i bring near my righteousness it shall not be far off and my salvation shall not tarry and i will place salvation in zion for israel my glory
come down and sit in the dust o virgin daughter of babylon sit on the ground there is no throne o daughter of the chaldeans for thou shalt no more be called tender and delicate
take the millstones and grind meal uncover thy locks make bare the leg uncover the thigh pass over the rivers
thy nakedness shall be uncovered yea thy shame shall be seen i will take vengeance and i will not meet thee as a man
as for our redeemer the lord of hosts is his name the holy one of israel
sit thou silent and get thee into darkness o daughter of the chaldeans for thou shalt no more be called the lady of kingdoms
i was wroth with my people i have polluted mine inheritance and given them into thine hand thou didst shew them no mercy upon the ancient hast thou very heavily laid thy yoke
and thou saidst i shall be a lady for ever so that thou didst not lay these things to thy heart neither didst remember the latter end of it
therefore hear now this thou that art given to pleasures that dwellest carelessly that sayest in thine heart i am and none else beside me i shall not sit as a widow neither shall i know the loss of children
but these two things shall come to thee in a moment in one day the loss of children and widowhood they shall come upon thee in their perfection for the multitude of thy sorceries and for the great abundance of thine enchantments
for thou hast trusted in thy wickedness thou hast said none seeth me thy wisdom and thy knowledge it hath perverted thee and thou hast said in thine heart i am and none else beside me
therefore shall evil come upon thee thou shalt not know from whence it riseth and mischief shall fall upon thee thou shalt not be able to put it off and desolation shall come upon thee suddenly which thou shalt not know
stand now with thine enchantments and with the multitude of thy sorceries wherein thou hast laboured from thy youth if so be thou shalt be able to profit if so be thou mayest prevail
thou art wearied in the multitude of thy counsels let now the astrologers the stargazers the monthly prognosticators stand up and save thee from these things that shall come upon thee
behold they shall be as stubble the fire shall burn them they shall not deliver themselves from the power of the flame there shall not be a coal to warm at nor fire to sit before it
thus shall they be unto thee with whom thou hast laboured even thy merchants from thy youth they shall wander every one to his quarter none shall save thee
hear ye this o house of jacob which are called by the name of israel and are come forth out of the waters of judah which swear by the name of the lord and make mention of the god of israel but not in truth nor in righteousness
for they call themselves of the holy city and stay themselves upon the god of israel the lord of hosts is his name
i have declared the former things from the beginning and they went forth out of my mouth and i shewed them i did them suddenly and they came to pass
because i knew that thou art obstinate and thy neck is an iron sinew and thy brow brass
i have even from the beginning declared it to thee before it came to pass i shewed it thee lest thou shouldest say mine idol hath done them and my graven image and my molten image hath commanded them
thou hast heard see all this and will not ye declare it i have shewed thee new things from this time even hidden things and thou didst not know them
they are created now and not from the beginning even before the day when thou heardest them not lest thou shouldest say behold i knew them
yea thou heardest not yea thou knewest not yea from that time that thine ear was not opened for i knew that thou wouldest deal very treacherously and wast called a transgressor from the womb
for my name's sake will i defer mine anger and for my praise will i refrain for thee that i cut thee not off
behold i have refined thee but not with silver i have chosen thee in the furnace of affliction
for mine own sake even for mine own sake will i do it for how should my name be polluted and i will not give my glory unto another
hearken unto me o jacob and israel my called i am he i am the first i also am the last
mine hand also hath laid the foundation of the earth and my right hand hath spanned the heavens when i call unto them they stand up together
all ye assemble yourselves and hear which among them hath declared these things the lord hath loved him he will do his pleasure on babylon and his arm shall be on the chaldeans
i even i have spoken yea i have called him i have brought him and he shall make his way prosperous
come ye near unto me hear ye this i have not spoken in secret from the beginning from the time that it was there am i and now the lord god and his spirit hath sent me
thus saith the lord thy redeemer the holy one of israel i am the lord thy god which teacheth thee to profit which leadeth thee by the way that thou shouldest go
o that thou hadst hearkened to my commandments then had thy peace been as a river and thy righteousness as the waves of the sea
thy seed also had been as the sand and the offspring of thy bowels like the gravel thereof his name should not have been cut off nor destroyed from before me
go ye forth of babylon flee ye from the chaldeans with a voice of singing declare ye tell this utter it even to the end of the earth say ye the lord hath redeemed his servant jacob
and they thirsted not when he led them through the deserts he caused the waters to flow out of the rock for them he clave the rock also and the waters gushed out
there is no peace saith the lord unto the wicked
listen o isles unto me and hearken ye people from far the lord hath called me from the womb from the bowels of my mother hath he made mention of my name
and he hath made my mouth like a sharp sword in the shadow of his hand hath he hid me and made me a polished shaft in his quiver hath he hid me
and said unto me thou art my servant o israel in whom i will be glorified
then i said i have laboured in vain i have spent my strength for nought and in vain yet surely my judgment is with the lord and my work with my god
and now saith the lord that formed me from the womb to be his servant to bring jacob again to him though israel be not gathered yet shall i be glorious in the eyes of the lord and my god shall be my strength
and he said it is a light thing that thou shouldest be my servant to raise up the tribes of jacob and to restore the preserved of israel i will also give thee for a light to the gentiles that thou mayest be my salvation unto the end of the earth
thus saith the lord the redeemer of israel and his holy one to him whom man despiseth to him whom the nation abhorreth to a servant of rulers kings shall see and arise princes also shall worship because of the lord that is faithful and the holy one of israel and he shall choose thee
thus saith the lord in an acceptable time have i heard thee and in a day of salvation have i helped thee and i will preserve thee and give thee for a covenant of the people to establish the earth to cause to inherit the desolate heritages
that thou mayest say to the prisoners go forth to them that are in darkness shew yourselves they shall feed in the ways and their pastures shall be in all high places
they shall not hunger nor thirst neither shall the heat nor sun smite them for he that hath mercy on them shall lead them even by the springs of water shall he guide them
and i will make all my mountains a way and my highways shall be exalted
behold these shall come from far and lo these from the north and from the west and these from the land of sinim
sing o heavens and be joyful o earth and break forth into singing o mountains for the lord hath comforted his people and will have mercy upon his afflicted
but zion said the lord hath forsaken me and my lord hath forgotten me
can a woman forget her sucking child that she should not have compassion on the son of her womb yea they may forget yet will i not forget thee
behold i have graven thee upon the palms of my hands thy walls are continually before me
thy children shall make haste thy destroyers and they that made thee waste shall go forth of thee
lift up thine eyes round about and behold all these gather themselves together and come to thee as i live saith the lord thou shalt surely clothe thee with them all as with an ornament and bind them on thee as a bride doeth
for thy waste and thy desolate places and the land of thy destruction shall even now be too narrow by reason of the inhabitants and they that swallowed thee up shall be far away
the children which thou shalt have after thou hast lost the other shall say again in thine ears the place is too strait for me give place to me that i may dwell
then shalt thou say in thine heart who hath begotten me these seeing i have lost my children and am desolate a captive and removing to and fro and who hath brought up these behold i was left alone these where had they been
thus saith the lord god behold i will lift up mine hand to the gentiles and set up my standard to the people and they shall bring thy sons in their arms and thy daughters shall be carried upon their shoulders
and kings shall be thy nursing fathers and their queens thy nursing mothers they shall bow down to thee with their face toward the earth and lick up the dust of thy feet and thou shalt know that i am the lord for they shall not be ashamed that wait for me
shall the prey be taken from the mighty or the lawful captive delivered
but thus saith the lord even the captives of the mighty shall be taken away and the prey of the terrible shall be delivered for i will contend with him that contendeth with thee and i will save thy children
and i will feed them that oppress thee with their own flesh and they shall be drunken with their own blood as with sweet wine and all flesh shall know that i the lord am thy saviour and thy redeemer the mighty one of jacob
thus saith the lord where is the bill of your mother's divorcement whom i have put away or which of my creditors is it to whom i have sold you behold for your iniquities have ye sold yourselves and for your transgressions is your mother put away
wherefore when i came was there no man when i called was there none to answer is my hand shortened at all that it cannot redeem or have i no power to deliver behold at my rebuke i dry up the sea i make the rivers a wilderness their fish stinketh because there is no water and dieth for thirst
i clothe the heavens with blackness and i make sackcloth their covering
the lord god hath given me the tongue of the learned that i should know how to speak a word in season to him that is weary he wakeneth morning by morning he wakeneth mine ear to hear as the learned
the lord god hath opened mine ear and i was not rebellious neither turned away back
i gave my back to the smiters and my cheeks to them that plucked off the hair i hid not my face from shame and spitting
for the lord god will help me therefore shall i not be confounded therefore have i set my face like a flint and i know that i shall not be ashamed
he is near that justifieth me who will contend with me let us stand together who is mine adversary let him come near to me
behold the lord god will help me who is he that shall condemn me lo they all shall wax old as a garment the moth shall eat them up
who is among you that feareth the lord that obeyeth the voice of his servant that walketh in darkness and hath no light let him trust in the name of the lord and stay upon his god
behold all ye that kindle a fire that compass yourselves about with sparks walk in the light of your fire and in the sparks that ye have kindled this shall ye have of mine hand ye shall lie down in sorrow
hearken to me ye that follow after righteousness ye that seek the lord look unto the rock whence ye are hewn and to the hole of the pit whence ye are digged
look unto abraham your father and unto sarah that bare you for i called him alone and blessed him and increased him
for the lord shall comfort zion he will comfort all her waste places and he will make her wilderness like eden and her desert like the garden of the lord joy and gladness shall be found therein thanksgiving and the voice of melody
hearken unto me my people and give ear unto me o my nation for a law shall proceed from me and i will make my judgment to rest for a light of the people
my righteousness is near my salvation is gone forth and mine arms shall judge the people the isles shall wait upon me and on mine arm shall they trust
lift up your eyes to the heavens and look upon the earth beneath for the heavens shall vanish away like smoke and the earth shall wax old like a garment and they that dwell therein shall die in like manner but my salvation shall be for ever and my righteousness shall not be abolished
hearken unto me ye that know righteousness the people in whose heart is my law fear ye not the reproach of men neither be ye afraid of their revilings
for the moth shall eat them up like a garment and the worm shall eat them like wool but my righteousness shall be for ever and my salvation from generation to generation
awake awake put on strength o arm of the lord awake as in the ancient days in the generations of old art thou not it that hath cut rahab and wounded the dragon
art thou not it which hath dried the sea the waters of the great deep that hath made the depths of the sea a way for the ransomed to pass over
therefore the redeemed of the lord shall return and come with singing unto zion and everlasting joy shall be upon their head they shall obtain gladness and joy and sorrow and mourning shall flee away
i even i am he that comforteth you who art thou that thou shouldest be afraid of a man that shall die and of the son of man which shall be made as grass
and forgettest the lord thy maker that hath stretched forth the heavens and laid the foundations of the earth and hast feared continually every day because of the fury of the oppressor as if he were ready to destroy and where is the fury of the oppressor
the captive exile hasteneth that he may be loosed and that he should not die in the pit nor that his bread should fail
but i am the lord thy god that divided the sea whose waves roared the lord of hosts is his name
and i have put my words in thy mouth and i have covered thee in the shadow of mine hand that i may plant the heavens and lay the foundations of the earth and say unto zion thou art my people
awake awake stand up o jerusalem which hast drunk at the hand of the lord the cup of his fury thou hast drunken the dregs of the cup of trembling and wrung them out
there is none to guide her among all the sons whom she hath brought forth neither is there any that taketh her by the hand of all the sons that she hath brought up
these two things are come unto thee who shall be sorry for thee desolation and destruction and the famine and the sword by whom shall i comfort thee
thy sons have fainted they lie at the head of all the streets as a wild bull in a net they are full of the fury of the lord the rebuke of thy god
therefore hear now this thou afflicted and drunken but not with wine
thus saith thy lord the lord and thy god that pleadeth the cause of his people behold i have taken out of thine hand the cup of trembling even the dregs of the cup of my fury thou shalt no more drink it again
but i will put it into the hand of them that afflict thee which have said to thy soul bow down that we may go over and thou hast laid thy body as the ground and as the street to them that went over
awake awake put on thy strength o zion put on thy beautiful garments o jerusalem the holy city for henceforth there shall no more come into thee the uncircumcised and the unclean
shake thyself from the dust arise and sit down o jerusalem loose thyself from the bands of thy neck o captive daughter of zion
for thus saith the lord ye have sold yourselves for nought and ye shall be redeemed without money
for thus saith the lord god my people went down aforetime into egypt to sojourn there and the assyrian oppressed them without cause
now therefore what have i here saith the lord that my people is taken away for nought they that rule over them make them to howl saith the lord and my name continually every day is blasphemed
therefore my people shall know my name therefore they shall know in that day that i am he that doth speak behold it is i
how beautiful upon the mountains are the feet of him that bringeth good tidings that publisheth peace that bringeth good tidings of good that publisheth salvation that saith unto zion thy god reigneth
thy watchmen shall lift up the voice with the voice together shall they sing for they shall see eye to eye when the lord shall bring again zion
break forth into joy sing together ye waste places of jerusalem for the lord hath comforted his people he hath redeemed jerusalem
the lord hath made bare his holy arm in the eyes of all the nations and all the ends of the earth shall see the salvation of our god
depart ye depart ye go ye out from thence touch no unclean thing go ye out of the midst of her be ye clean that bear the vessels of the lord
for ye shall not go out with haste nor go by flight for the lord will go before you and the god of israel will be your rereward
behold my servant shall deal prudently he shall be exalted and extolled and be very high
as many were astonied at thee his visage was so marred more than any man and his form more than the sons of men
so shall he sprinkle many nations the kings shall shut their mouths at him for that which had not been told them shall they see and that which they had not heard shall they consider
who hath believed our report and to whom is the arm of the lord revealed
for he shall grow up before him as a tender plant and as a root out of a dry ground he hath no form nor comeliness and when we shall see him there is no beauty that we should desire him
he is despised and rejected of men a man of sorrows and acquainted with grief and we hid as it were our faces from him he was despised and we esteemed him not
surely he hath borne our griefs and carried our sorrows yet we did esteem him stricken smitten of god and afflicted
but he was wounded for our transgressions he was bruised for our iniquities the chastisement of our peace was upon him and with his stripes we are healed
all we like sheep have gone astray we have turned every one to his own way and the lord hath laid on him the iniquity of us all
he was oppressed and he was afflicted yet he opened not his mouth he is brought as a lamb to the slaughter and as a sheep before her shearers is dumb so he openeth not his mouth
he was taken from prison and from judgment and who shall declare his generation for he was cut off out of the land of the living for the transgression of my people was he stricken
and he made his grave with the wicked and with the rich in his death because he had done no violence neither was any deceit in his mouth
yet it pleased the lord to bruise him he hath put him to grief when thou shalt make his soul an offering for sin he shall see his seed he shall prolong his days and the pleasure of the lord shall prosper in his hand
he shall see of the travail of his soul and shall be satisfied by his knowledge shall my righteous servant justify many for he shall bear their iniquities
therefore will i divide him a portion with the great and he shall divide the spoil with the strong because he hath poured out his soul unto death and he was numbered with the transgressors and he bare the sin of many and made intercession for the transgressors
sing o barren thou that didst not bear break forth into singing and cry aloud thou that didst not travail with child for more are the children of the desolate than the children of the married wife saith the lord
enlarge the place of thy tent and let them stretch forth the curtains of thine habitations spare not lengthen thy cords and strengthen thy stakes
for thou shalt break forth on the right hand and on the left and thy seed shall inherit the gentiles and make the desolate cities to be inhabited
fear not for thou shalt not be ashamed neither be thou confounded for thou shalt not be put to shame for thou shalt forget the shame of thy youth and shalt not remember the reproach of thy widowhood any more
for thy maker is thine husband the lord of hosts is his name and thy redeemer the holy one of israel the god of the whole earth shall he be called
for the lord hath called thee as a woman forsaken and grieved in spirit and a wife of youth when thou wast refused saith thy god
for a small moment have i forsaken thee but with great mercies will i gather thee
in a little wrath i hid my face from thee for a moment but with everlasting kindness will i have mercy on thee saith the lord thy redeemer
for this is as the waters of noah unto me for as i have sworn that the waters of noah should no more go over the earth so have i sworn that i would not be wroth with thee nor rebuke thee
for the mountains shall depart and the hills be removed but my kindness shall not depart from thee neither shall the covenant of my peace be removed saith the lord that hath mercy on thee
o thou afflicted tossed with tempest and not comforted behold i will lay thy stones with fair colours and lay thy foundations with sapphires
and i will make thy windows of agates and thy gates of carbuncles and all thy borders of pleasant stones
and all thy children shall be taught of the lord and great shall be the peace of thy children
in righteousness shalt thou be established thou shalt be far from oppression for thou shalt not fear and from terror for it shall not come near thee
behold they shall surely gather together but not by me whosoever shall gather together against thee shall fall for thy sake
behold i have created the smith that bloweth the coals in the fire and that bringeth forth an instrument for his work and i have created the waster to destroy
no weapon that is formed against thee shall prosper and every tongue that shall rise against thee in judgment thou shalt condemn this is the heritage of the servants of the lord and their righteousness is of me saith the lord
ho every one that thirsteth come ye to the waters and he that hath no money come ye buy and eat yea come buy wine and milk without money and without price
wherefore do ye spend money for that which is not bread and your labour for that which satisfieth not hearken diligently unto me and eat ye that which is good and let your soul delight itself in fatness
incline your ear and come unto me hear and your soul shall live and i will make an everlasting covenant with you even the sure mercies of david
behold i have given him for a witness to the people a leader and commander to the people
behold thou shalt call a nation that thou knowest not and nations that knew not thee shall run unto thee because of the lord thy god and for the holy one of israel for he hath glorified thee
seek ye the lord while he may be found call ye upon him while he is near
let the wicked forsake his way and the unrighteous man his thoughts and let him return unto the lord and he will have mercy upon him and to our god for he will abundantly pardon
for my thoughts are not your thoughts neither are your ways my ways saith the lord
for as the heavens are higher than the earth so are my ways higher than your ways and my thoughts than your thoughts
for as the rain cometh down and the snow from heaven and returneth not thither but watereth the earth and maketh it bring forth and bud that it may give seed to the sower and bread to the eater
so shall my word be that goeth forth out of my mouth it shall not return unto me void but it shall accomplish that which i please and it shall prosper in the thing whereto i sent it
for ye shall go out with joy and be led forth with peace the mountains and the hills shall break forth before you into singing and all the trees of the field shall clap their hands
instead of the thorn shall come up the fir tree and instead of the brier shall come up the myrtle tree and it shall be to the lord for a name for an everlasting sign that shall not be cut off
thus saith the lord keep ye judgment and do justice for my salvation is near to come and my righteousness to be revealed
blessed is the man that doeth this and the son of man that layeth hold on it that keepeth the sabbath from polluting it and keepeth his hand from doing any evil
neither let the son of the stranger that hath joined himself to the lord speak saying the lord hath utterly separated me from his people neither let the eunuch say behold i am a dry tree
for thus saith the lord unto the eunuchs that keep my sabbaths and choose the things that please me and take hold of my covenant
even unto them will i give in mine house and within my walls a place and a name better than of sons and of daughters i will give them an everlasting name that shall not be cut off
also the sons of the stranger that join themselves to the lord to serve him and to love the name of the lord to be his servants every one that keepeth the sabbath from polluting it and taketh hold of my covenant
even them will i bring to my holy mountain and make them joyful in my house of prayer their burnt offerings and their sacrifices shall be accepted upon mine altar for mine house shall be called an house of prayer for all people
the lord god which gathereth the outcasts of israel saith yet will i gather others to him beside those that are gathered unto him
all ye beasts of the field come to devour yea all ye beasts in the forest
his watchmen are blind they are all ignorant they are all dumb dogs they cannot bark sleeping lying down loving to slumber
yea they are greedy dogs which can never have enough and they are shepherds that cannot understand they all look to their own way every one for his gain from his quarter
come ye say they i will fetch wine and we will fill ourselves with strong drink and to morrow shall be as this day and much more abundant
the righteous perisheth and no man layeth it to heart and merciful men are taken away none considering that the righteous is taken away from the evil to come
he shall enter into peace they shall rest in their beds each one walking in his uprightness
but draw near hither ye sons of the sorceress the seed of the adulterer and the whore
against whom do ye sport yourselves against whom make ye a wide mouth and draw out the tongue are ye not children of transgression a seed of falsehood
enflaming yourselves with idols under every green tree slaying the children in the valleys under the clifts of the rocks
among the smooth stones of the stream is thy portion they they are thy lot even to them hast thou poured a drink offering thou hast offered a meat offering should i receive comfort in these
upon a lofty and high mountain hast thou set thy bed even thither wentest thou up to offer sacrifice
behind the doors also and the posts hast thou set up thy remembrance for thou hast discovered thyself to another than me and art gone up thou hast enlarged thy bed and made thee a covenant with them thou lovedst their bed where thou sawest it
and thou wentest to the king with ointment and didst increase thy perfumes and didst send thy messengers far off and didst debase thyself even unto hell
thou art wearied in the greatness of thy way yet saidst thou not there is no hope thou hast found the life of thine hand therefore thou wast not grieved
and of whom hast thou been afraid or feared that thou hast lied and hast not remembered me nor laid it to thy heart have not i held my peace even of old and thou fearest me not
i will declare thy righteousness and thy works for they shall not profit thee
when thou criest let thy companies deliver thee but the wind shall carry them all away vanity shall take them but he that putteth his trust in me shall possess the land and shall inherit my holy mountain
and shall say cast ye up cast ye up prepare the way take up the stumblingblock out of the way of my people
for thus saith the high and lofty one that inhabiteth eternity whose name is holy i dwell in the high and holy place with him also that is of a contrite and humble spirit to revive the spirit of the humble and to revive the heart of the contrite ones
for i will not contend for ever neither will i be always wroth for the spirit should fail before me and the souls which i have made
for the iniquity of his covetousness was i wroth and smote him i hid me and was wroth and he went on frowardly in the way of his heart
i have seen his ways and will heal him i will lead him also and restore comforts unto him and to his mourners
i create the fruit of the lips peace peace to him that is far off and to him that is near saith the lord and i will heal him
but the wicked are like the troubled sea when it cannot rest whose waters cast up mire and dirt
there is no peace saith my god to the wicked
cry aloud spare not lift up thy voice like a trumpet and shew my people their transgression and the house of jacob their sins
yet they seek me daily and delight to know my ways as a nation that did righteousness and forsook not the ordinance of their god they ask of me the ordinances of justice they take delight in approaching to god
wherefore have we fasted say they and thou seest not wherefore have we afflicted our soul and thou takest no knowledge behold in the day of your fast ye find pleasure and exact all your labours
behold ye fast for strife and debate and to smite with the fist of wickedness ye shall not fast as ye do this day to make your voice to be heard on high
is it such a fast that i have chosen a day for a man to afflict his soul is it to bow down his head as a bulrush and to spread sackcloth and ashes under him wilt thou call this a fast and an acceptable day to the lord
is not this the fast that i have chosen to loose the bands of wickedness to undo the heavy burdens and to let the oppressed go free and that ye break every yoke
is it not to deal thy bread to the hungry and that thou bring the poor that are cast out to thy house when thou seest the naked that thou cover him and that thou hide not thyself from thine own flesh
then shall thy light break forth as the morning and thine health shall spring forth speedily and thy righteousness shall go before thee the glory of the lord shall be thy rereward
then shalt thou call and the lord shall answer thou shalt cry and he shall say here i am if thou take away from the midst of thee the yoke the putting forth of the finger and speaking vanity
and if thou draw out thy soul to the hungry and satisfy the afflicted soul then shall thy light rise in obscurity and thy darkness be as the noon day
and the lord shall guide thee continually and satisfy thy soul in drought and make fat thy bones and thou shalt be like a watered garden and like a spring of water whose waters fail not
