 him so pictured you must either be directed by
 some that take upon them to know or do take upon
 yourself that which i am sure you do not know or
 jump the after inquiry on your own peril and how
 you shall speed in your journey's end i think you'll
 never return to tell one
posthumus leonatus i tell thee fellow there are none want eyes to
 direct them the way i am going but such as wink and
 will not use them
first gaoler what an infinite mock is this that a man should
 have the best use of eyes to see the way of
 blindness i am sure hanging's the way of winking
 enter a messenger
messenger knock off his manacles bring your prisoner to the king
posthumus leonatus thou bring'st good news i am called to be made free
first gaoler i'll be hang'd then
posthumus leonatus thou shalt be then freer than a gaoler no bolts for the dead
 exeunt posthumus leonatus and messenger
first gaoler unless a man would marry a gallows and beget young
 gibbets i never saw one so prone yet on my
 conscience there are verier knaves desire to live
 for all he be a roman and there be some of them
 too that die against their wills so should i if i
 were one i would we were all of one mind and one
 mind good o there were desolation of gaolers and
 gallowses i speak against my present profit but
 my wish hath a preferment in t
 exeunt
 cymbeline
act v
scene v cymbeline's tent
 enter cymbeline belarius guiderius arviragus
 pisanio lords officers and attendants
cymbeline stand by my side you whom the gods have made
 preservers of my throne woe is my heart
 that the poor soldier that so richly fought
 whose rags shamed gilded arms whose naked breast
 stepp'd before larges of proof cannot be found
 he shall be happy that can find him if
 our grace can make him so
belarius i never saw
 such noble fury in so poor a thing
 such precious deeds in one that promises nought
 but beggary and poor looks
cymbeline no tidings of him
pisanio he hath been search'd among the dead and living
 but no trace of him
cymbeline to my grief i am
 the heir of his reward
 to belarius guiderius and arviragus
 which i will add
 to you the liver heart and brain of britain
 by whom i grant she lives tis now the time
 to ask of whence you are report it
belarius sir
 in cambria are we born and gentlemen
 further to boast were neither true nor modest
 unless i add we are honest
cymbeline bow your knees
 arise my knights o the battle i create you
 companions to our person and will fit you
 with dignities becoming your estates
 enter cornelius and ladies
 there's business in these faces why so sadly
 greet you our victory you look like romans
 and not o the court of britain
cornelius hail great king
 to sour your happiness i must report
 the queen is dead
cymbeline who worse than a physician
 would this report become but i consider
 by medicine life may be prolong'd yet death
 will seize the doctor too how ended she
cornelius with horror madly dying like her life
 which being cruel to the world concluded
 most cruel to herself what she confess'd
 i will report so please you these her women
 can trip me if i err who with wet cheeks
 were present when she finish'd
cymbeline prithee say
cornelius first she confess'd she never loved you only
 affected greatness got by you not you
 married your royalty was wife to your place
 abhorr'd your person
cymbeline she alone knew this
 and but she spoke it dying i would not
 believe her lips in opening it proceed
cornelius your daughter whom she bore in hand to love
 with such integrity she did confess
 was as a scorpion to her sight whose life
 but that her flight prevented it she had
 ta'en off by poison
cymbeline o most delicate fiend
 who is t can read a woman is there more
cornelius more sir and worse she did confess she had
 for you a mortal mineral which being took
 should by the minute feed on life and lingering
 by inches waste you in which time she purposed
 by watching weeping tendance kissing to
 o'ercome you with her show and in time
 when she had fitted you with her craft to work
 her son into the adoption of the crown
 but failing of her end by his strange absence
 grew shamelessdesperate open'd in despite
 of heaven and men her purposes repented
 the evils she hatch'd were not effected so
 despairing died
cymbeline heard you all this her women
first lady we did so please your highness
cymbeline mine eyes
 were not in fault for she was beautiful
 mine ears that heard her flattery nor my heart
 that thought her like her seeming it had
 been vicious
 to have mistrusted her yet o my daughter
 that it was folly in me thou mayst say
 and prove it in thy feeling heaven mend all
 enter lucius iachimo the soothsayer and other
 roman prisoners guarded posthumus leonatus
 behind and imogen
 thou comest not caius now for tribute that
 the britons have razed out though with the loss
 of many a bold one whose kinsmen have made suit
 that their good souls may be appeased with slaughter
 of you their captives which ourself have granted
 so think of your estate
caius lucius consider sir the chance of war the day
 was yours by accident had it gone with us
 we should not when the blood was cool
 have threaten'd
 our prisoners with the sword but since the gods
 will have it thus that nothing but our lives
 may be call'd ransom let it come sufficeth
 a roman with a roman's heart can suffer
 augustus lives to think on't and so much
 for my peculiar care this one thing only
 i will entreat my boy a briton born
 let him be ransom'd never master had
 a page so kind so duteous diligent
 so tender over his occasions true
 so feat so nurselike let his virtue join
 with my request which i make bold your highness
 cannot deny he hath done no briton harm
 though he have served a roman save him sir
 and spare no blood beside
cymbeline i have surely seen him
 his favour is familiar to me boy
 thou hast look'd thyself into my grace
 and art mine own i know not why wherefore
 to say live boy ne'er thank thy master live
 and ask of cymbeline what boon thou wilt
 fitting my bounty and thy state i'll give it
 yea though thou do demand a prisoner
 the noblest ta'en
imogen i humbly thank your highness
caius lucius i do not bid thee beg my life good lad
 and yet i know thou wilt
imogen no no alack
 there's other work in hand i see a thing
 bitter to me as death your life good master
 must shuffle for itself
caius lucius the boy disdains me
 he leaves me scorns me briefly die their joys
 that place them on the truth of girls and boys
 why stands he so perplex'd
cymbeline what wouldst thou boy
 i love thee more and more think more and more
 what's best to ask know'st him thou look'st on speak
 wilt have him live is he thy kin thy friend
imogen he is a roman no more kin to me
 than i to your highness who being born your vassal
 am something nearer
cymbeline wherefore eyest him so
imogen i'll tell you sir in private if you please
 to give me hearing
cymbeline ay with all my heart
 and lend my best attention what's thy name
imogen fidele sir
cymbeline thou'rt my good youth my page
 i'll be thy master walk with me speak freely
 cymbeline and imogen converse apart
belarius is not this boy revived from death
arviragus one sand another
 not more resembles that sweet rosy lad
 who died and was fidele what think you
guiderius the same dead thing alive
belarius peace peace see further he eyes us not forbear
 creatures may be alike were t he i am sure
 he would have spoke to us
guiderius but we saw him dead
belarius be silent let's see further
pisanio aside it is my mistress
 since she is living let the time run on
 to good or bad
 cymbeline and imogen come forward
cymbeline come stand thou by our side
 make thy demand aloud
 to iachimo
 sir step you forth
 give answer to this boy and do it freely
