and on the morrow when he departed he took out two pence and gave them to the host and said unto him take care of him and whatsoever thou spendest more when i come again i will repay thee
which now of these three thinkest thou was neighbour unto him that fell among the thieves
and he said he that shewed mercy on him then said jesus unto him go and do thou likewise
now it came to pass as they went that he entered into a certain village and a certain woman named martha received him into her house
and she had a sister called mary which also sat at jesus feet and heard his word
but martha was cumbered about much serving and came to him and said lord dost thou not care that my sister hath left me to serve alone bid her therefore that she help me
and jesus answered and said unto her martha martha thou art careful and troubled about many things
but one thing is needful and mary hath chosen that good part which shall not be taken away from her
and it came to pass that as he was praying in a certain place when he ceased one of his disciples said unto him lord teach us to pray as john also taught his disciples
and he said unto them when ye pray say our father which art in heaven hallowed be thy name thy kingdom come thy will be done as in heaven so in earth
give us day by day our daily bread
and forgive us our sins for we also forgive every one that is indebted to us and lead us not into temptation but deliver us from evil
and he said unto them which of you shall have a friend and shall go unto him at midnight and say unto him friend lend me three loaves
for a friend of mine in his journey is come to me and i have nothing to set before him
and he from within shall answer and say trouble me not the door is now shut and my children are with me in bed i cannot rise and give thee
i say unto you though he will not rise and give him because he is his friend yet because of his importunity he will rise and give him as many as he needeth
and i say unto you ask and it shall be given you seek and ye shall find knock and it shall be opened unto you
for every one that asketh receiveth and he that seeketh findeth and to him that knocketh it shall be opened
if a son shall ask bread of any of you that is a father will he give him a stone or if he ask a fish will he for a fish give him a serpent
or if he shall ask an egg will he offer him a scorpion
if ye then being evil know how to give good gifts unto your children how much more shall your heavenly father give the holy spirit to them that ask him
and he was casting out a devil and it was dumb and it came to pass when the devil was gone out the dumb spake and the people wondered
but some of them said he casteth out devils through beelzebub the chief of the devils
and others tempting him sought of him a sign from heaven
but he knowing their thoughts said unto them every kingdom divided against itself is brought to desolation and a house divided against a house falleth
if satan also be divided against himself how shall his kingdom stand because ye say that i cast out devils through beelzebub
and if i by beelzebub cast out devils by whom do your sons cast them out therefore shall they be your judges
but if i with the finger of god cast out devils no doubt the kingdom of god is come upon you
when a strong man armed keepeth his palace his goods are in peace
but when a stronger than he shall come upon him and overcome him he taketh from him all his armour wherein he trusted and divideth his spoils
he that is not with me is against me and he that gathereth not with me scattereth
when the unclean spirit is gone out of a man he walketh through dry places seeking rest and finding none he saith i will return unto my house whence i came out
and when he cometh he findeth it swept and garnished
then goeth he and taketh to him seven other spirits more wicked than himself and they enter in and dwell there and the last state of that man is worse than the first
and it came to pass as he spake these things a certain woman of the company lifted up her voice and said unto him blessed is the womb that bare thee and the paps which thou hast sucked
but he said yea rather blessed are they that hear the word of god and keep it
and when the people were gathered thick together he began to say this is an evil generation they seek a sign and there shall no sign be given it but the sign of jonas the prophet
for as jonas was a sign unto the ninevites so shall also the son of man be to this generation
the queen of the south shall rise up in the judgment with the men of this generation and condemn them for she came from the utmost parts of the earth to hear the wisdom of solomon and behold a greater than solomon is here
the men of nineve shall rise up in the judgment with this generation and shall condemn it for they repented at the preaching of jonas and behold a greater than jonas is here
no man when he hath lighted a candle putteth it in a secret place neither under a bushel but on a candlestick that they which come in may see the light
the light of the body is the eye therefore when thine eye is single thy whole body also is full of light but when thine eye is evil thy body also is full of darkness
take heed therefore that the light which is in thee be not darkness
if thy whole body therefore be full of light having no part dark the whole shall be full of light as when the bright shining of a candle doth give thee light
and as he spake a certain pharisee besought him to dine with him and he went in and sat down to meat
and when the pharisee saw it he marvelled that he had not first washed before dinner
and the lord said unto him now do ye pharisees make clean the outside of the cup and the platter but your inward part is full of ravening and wickedness
ye fools did not he that made that which is without make that which is within also
but rather give alms of such things as ye have and behold all things are clean unto you
but woe unto you pharisees for ye tithe mint and rue and all manner of herbs and pass over judgment and the love of god these ought ye to have done and not to leave the other undone
woe unto you pharisees for ye love the uppermost seats in the synagogues and greetings in the markets
woe unto you scribes and pharisees hypocrites for ye are as graves which appear not and the men that walk over them are not aware of them
then answered one of the lawyers and said unto him master thus saying thou reproachest us also
and he said woe unto you also ye lawyers for ye lade men with burdens grievous to be borne and ye yourselves touch not the burdens with one of your fingers
woe unto you for ye build the sepulchres of the prophets and your fathers killed them
truly ye bear witness that ye allow the deeds of your fathers for they indeed killed them and ye build their sepulchres
therefore also said the wisdom of god i will send them prophets and apostles and some of them they shall slay and persecute
that the blood of all the prophets which was shed from the foundation of the world may be required of this generation
from the blood of abel unto the blood of zacharias which perished between the altar and the temple verily i say unto you it shall be required of this generation
woe unto you lawyers for ye have taken away the key of knowledge ye entered not in yourselves and them that were entering in ye hindered
and as he said these things unto them the scribes and the pharisees began to urge him vehemently and to provoke him to speak of many things
laying wait for him and seeking to catch something out of his mouth that they might accuse him
in the mean time when there were gathered together an innumerable multitude of people insomuch that they trode one upon another he began to say unto his disciples first of all beware ye of the leaven of the pharisees which is hypocrisy
for there is nothing covered that shall not be revealed neither hid that shall not be known
therefore whatsoever ye have spoken in darkness shall be heard in the light and that which ye have spoken in the ear in closets shall be proclaimed upon the housetops
and i say unto you my friends be not afraid of them that kill the body and after that have no more that they can do
but i will forewarn you whom ye shall fear fear him which after he hath killed hath power to cast into hell yea i say unto you fear him
are not five sparrows sold for two farthings and not one of them is forgotten before god
but even the very hairs of your head are all numbered fear not therefore ye are of more value than many sparrows
also i say unto you whosoever shall confess me before men him shall the son of man also confess before the angels of god
but he that denieth me before men shall be denied before the angels of god
and whosoever shall speak a word against the son of man it shall be forgiven him but unto him that blasphemeth against the holy ghost it shall not be forgiven
and when they bring you unto the synagogues and unto magistrates and powers take ye no thought how or what thing ye shall answer or what ye shall say
for the holy ghost shall teach you in the same hour what ye ought to say
and one of the company said unto him master speak to my brother that he divide the inheritance with me
and he said unto him man who made me a judge or a divider over you
and he said unto them take heed and beware of covetousness for a man's life consisteth not in the abundance of the things which he possesseth
and he spake a parable unto them saying the ground of a certain rich man brought forth plentifully
and he thought within himself saying what shall i do because i have no room where to bestow my fruits
and he said this will i do i will pull down my barns and build greater and there will i bestow all my fruits and my goods
and i will say to my soul soul thou hast much goods laid up for many years take thine ease eat drink and be merry
but god said unto him thou fool this night thy soul shall be required of thee then whose shall those things be which thou hast provided
so is he that layeth up treasure for himself and is not rich toward god
and he said unto his disciples therefore i say unto you take no thought for your life what ye shall eat neither for the body what ye shall put on
the life is more than meat and the body is more than raiment
consider the ravens for they neither sow nor reap which neither have storehouse nor barn and god feedeth them how much more are ye better than the fowls
and which of you with taking thought can add to his stature one cubit
if ye then be not able to do that thing which is least why take ye thought for the rest
consider the lilies how they grow they toil not they spin not and yet i say unto you that solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these
if then god so clothe the grass which is to day in the field and to morrow is cast into the oven how much more will he clothe you o ye of little faith
and seek not ye what ye shall eat or what ye shall drink neither be ye of doubtful mind
for all these things do the nations of the world seek after and your father knoweth that ye have need of these things
but rather seek ye the kingdom of god and all these things shall be added unto you
fear not little flock for it is your father's good pleasure to give you the kingdom
sell that ye have and give alms provide yourselves bags which wax not old a treasure in the heavens that faileth not where no thief approacheth neither moth corrupteth
for where your treasure is there will your heart be also
let your loins be girded about and your lights burning
and ye yourselves like unto men that wait for their lord when he will return from the wedding that when he cometh and knocketh they may open unto him immediately
blessed are those servants whom the lord when he cometh shall find watching verily i say unto you that he shall gird himself and make them to sit down to meat and will come forth and serve them
and if he shall come in the second watch or come in the third watch and find them so blessed are those servants
and this know that if the goodman of the house had known what hour the thief would come he would have watched and not have suffered his house to be broken through
be ye therefore ready also for the son of man cometh at an hour when ye think not
then peter said unto him lord speakest thou this parable unto us or even to all
and the lord said who then is that faithful and wise steward whom his lord shall make ruler over his household to give them their portion of meat in due season
blessed is that servant whom his lord when he cometh shall find so doing
of a truth i say unto you that he will make him ruler over all that he hath
but and if that servant say in his heart my lord delayeth his coming and shall begin to beat the menservants and maidens and to eat and drink and to be drunken
the lord of that servant will come in a day when he looketh not for him and at an hour when he is not aware and will cut him in sunder and will appoint him his portion with the unbelievers
and that servant which knew his lord's will and prepared not himself neither did according to his will shall be beaten with many stripes
but he that knew not and did commit things worthy of stripes shall be beaten with few stripes for unto whomsoever much is given of him shall be much required and to whom men have committed much of him they will ask the more
i am come to send fire on the earth and what will i if it be already kindled
but i have a baptism to be baptized with and how am i straitened till it be accomplished
suppose ye that i am come to give peace on earth i tell you nay but rather division
for from henceforth there shall be five in one house divided three against two and two against three
the father shall be divided against the son and the son against the father the mother against the daughter and the daughter against the mother the mother in law against her daughter in law and the daughter in law against her mother in law
and he said also to the people when ye see a cloud rise out of the west straightway ye say there cometh a shower and so it is
and when ye see the south wind blow ye say there will be heat and it cometh to pass
ye hypocrites ye can discern the face of the sky and of the earth but how is it that ye do not discern this time
yea and why even of yourselves judge ye not what is right
when thou goest with thine adversary to the magistrate as thou art in the way give diligence that thou mayest be delivered from him lest he hale thee to the judge and the judge deliver thee to the officer and the officer cast thee into prison
i tell thee thou shalt not depart thence till thou hast paid the very last mite
there were present at that season some that told him of the galilaeans whose blood pilate had mingled with their sacrifices
and jesus answering said unto them suppose ye that these galilaeans were sinners above all the galilaeans because they suffered such things
i tell you nay but except ye repent ye shall all likewise perish
or those eighteen upon whom the tower in siloam fell and slew them think ye that they were sinners above all men that dwelt in jerusalem
i tell you nay but except ye repent ye shall all likewise perish
he spake also this parable a certain man had a fig tree planted in his vineyard and he came and sought fruit thereon and found none
then said he unto the dresser of his vineyard behold these three years i come seeking fruit on this fig tree and find none cut it down why cumbereth it the ground
and he answering said unto him lord let it alone this year also till i shall dig about it and dung it
and if it bear fruit well and if not then after that thou shalt cut it down
and he was teaching in one of the synagogues on the sabbath
and behold there was a woman which had a spirit of infirmity eighteen years and was bowed together and could in no wise lift up herself
and when jesus saw her he called her to him and said unto her woman thou art loosed from thine infirmity
and he laid his hands on her and immediately she was made straight and glorified god
and the ruler of the synagogue answered with indignation because that jesus had healed on the sabbath day and said unto the people there are six days in which men ought to work in them therefore come and be healed and not on the sabbath day
the lord then answered him and said thou hypocrite doth not each one of you on the sabbath loose his ox or his ass from the stall and lead him away to watering
and ought not this woman being a daughter of abraham whom satan hath bound lo these eighteen years be loosed from this bond on the sabbath day
and when he had said these things all his adversaries were ashamed and all the people rejoiced for all the glorious things that were done by him
then said he unto what is the kingdom of god like and whereunto shall i resemble it
it is like a grain of mustard seed which a man took and cast into his garden and it grew and waxed a great tree and the fowls of the air lodged in the branches of it
and again he said whereunto shall i liken the kingdom of god
it is like leaven which a woman took and hid in three measures of meal till the whole was leavened
and he went through the cities and villages teaching and journeying toward jerusalem
then said one unto him lord are there few that be saved and he said unto them
strive to enter in at the strait gate for many i say unto you will seek to enter in and shall not be able
when once the master of the house is risen up and hath shut to the door and ye begin to stand without and to knock at the door saying lord lord open unto us and he shall answer and say unto you i know you not whence ye are
then shall ye begin to say we have eaten and drunk in thy presence and thou hast taught in our streets
but he shall say i tell you i know you not whence ye are depart from me all ye workers of iniquity
there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth when ye shall see abraham and isaac and jacob and all the prophets in the kingdom of god and you yourselves thrust out
and they shall come from the east and from the west and from the north and from the south and shall sit down in the kingdom of god
and behold there are last which shall be first and there are first which shall be last
the same day there came certain of the pharisees saying unto him get thee out and depart hence for herod will kill thee
and he said unto them go ye and tell that fox behold i cast out devils and i do cures to day and to morrow and the third day i shall be perfected
nevertheless i must walk to day and to morrow and the day following for it cannot be that a prophet perish out of jerusalem
o jerusalem jerusalem which killest the prophets and stonest them that are sent unto thee how often would i have gathered thy children together as a hen doth gather her brood under her wings and ye would not
behold your house is left unto you desolate and verily i say unto you ye shall not see me until the time come when ye shall say blessed is he that cometh in the name of the lord
and it came to pass as he went into the house of one of the chief pharisees to eat bread on the sabbath day that they watched him
and behold there was a certain man before him which had the dropsy
and jesus answering spake unto the lawyers and pharisees saying is it lawful to heal on the sabbath day
and they held their peace and he took him and healed him and let him go
and answered them saying which of you shall have an ass or an ox fallen into a pit and will not straightway pull him out on the sabbath day
and they could not answer him again to these things
and he put forth a parable to those which were bidden when he marked how they chose out the chief rooms saying unto them
when thou art bidden of any man to a wedding sit not down in the highest room lest a more honourable man than thou be bidden of him
and he that bade thee and him come and say to thee give this man place and thou begin with shame to take the lowest room
but when thou art bidden go and sit down in the lowest room that when he that bade thee cometh he may say unto thee friend go up higher then shalt thou have worship in the presence of them that sit at meat with thee
for whosoever exalteth himself shall be abased and he that humbleth himself shall be exalted
then said he also to him that bade him when thou makest a dinner or a supper call not thy friends nor thy brethren neither thy kinsmen nor thy rich neighbours lest they also bid thee again and a recompence be made thee
but when thou makest a feast call the poor the maimed the lame the blind
and thou shalt be blessed for they cannot recompense thee for thou shalt be recompensed at the resurrection of the just
and when one of them that sat at meat with him heard these things he said unto him blessed is he that shall eat bread in the kingdom of god
then said he unto him a certain man made a great supper and bade many
and sent his servant at supper time to say to them that were bidden come for all things are now ready
and they all with one consent began to make excuse the first said unto him i have bought a piece of ground and i must needs go and see it i pray thee have me excused
and another said i have bought five yoke of oxen and i go to prove them i pray thee have me excused
and another said i have married a wife and therefore i cannot come
so that servant came and shewed his lord these things then the master of the house being angry said to his servant go out quickly into the streets and lanes of the city and bring in hither the poor and the maimed and the halt and the blind
and the servant said lord it is done as thou hast commanded and yet there is room
and the lord said unto the servant go out into the highways and hedges and compel them to come in that my house may be filled
for i say unto you that none of those men which were bidden shall taste of my supper
and there went great multitudes with him and he turned and said unto them
if any man come to me and hate not his father and mother and wife and children and brethren and sisters yea and his own life also he cannot be my disciple
and whosoever doth not bear his cross and come after me cannot be my disciple
for which of you intending to build a tower sitteth not down first and counteth the cost whether he have sufficient to finish it
lest haply after he hath laid the foundation and is not able to finish it all that behold it begin to mock him
saying this man began to build and was not able to finish
or what king going to make war against another king sitteth not down first and consulteth whether he be able with ten thousand to meet him that cometh against him with twenty thousand
or else while the other is yet a great way off he sendeth an ambassage and desireth conditions of peace
so likewise whosoever he be of you that forsaketh not all that he hath he cannot be my disciple
salt is good but if the salt have lost his savour wherewith shall it be seasoned
it is neither fit for the land nor yet for the dunghill but men cast it out he that hath ears to hear let him hear
then drew near unto him all the publicans and sinners for to hear him
and the pharisees and scribes murmured saying this man receiveth sinners and eateth with them
and he spake this parable unto them saying
what man of you having an hundred sheep if he lose one of them doth not leave the ninety and nine in the wilderness and go after that which is lost until he find it
and when he hath found it he layeth it on his shoulders rejoicing
and when he cometh home he calleth together his friends and neighbours saying unto them rejoice with me for i have found my sheep which was lost
i say unto you that likewise joy shall be in heaven over one sinner that repenteth more than over ninety and nine just persons which need no repentance
either what woman having ten pieces of silver if she lose one piece doth not light a candle and sweep the house and seek diligently till she find it
and when she hath found it she calleth her friends and her neighbours together saying rejoice with me for i have found the piece which i had lost
