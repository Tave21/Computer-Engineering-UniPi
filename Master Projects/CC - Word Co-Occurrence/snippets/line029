for i lift up my hand to heaven and say i live for ever
if i whet my glittering sword and mine hand take hold on judgment i will render vengeance to mine enemies and will reward them that hate me
i will make mine arrows drunk with blood and my sword shall devour flesh and that with the blood of the slain and of the captives from the beginning of revenges upon the enemy
rejoice o ye nations with his people for he will avenge the blood of his servants and will render vengeance to his adversaries and will be merciful unto his land and to his people
and moses came and spake all the words of this song in the ears of the people he and hoshea the son of nun
and moses made an end of speaking all these words to all israel
and he said unto them set your hearts unto all the words which i testify among you this day which ye shall command your children to observe to do all the words of this law
for it is not a vain thing for you because it is your life and through this thing ye shall prolong your days in the land whither ye go over jordan to possess it
and the lord spake unto moses that selfsame day saying
get thee up into this mountain abarim unto mount nebo which is in the land of moab that is over against jericho and behold the land of canaan which i give unto the children of israel for a possession
and die in the mount whither thou goest up and be gathered unto thy people as aaron thy brother died in mount hor and was gathered unto his people
because ye trespassed against me among the children of israel at the waters of meribahkadesh in the wilderness of zin because ye sanctified me not in the midst of the children of israel
yet thou shalt see the land before thee but thou shalt not go thither unto the land which i give the children of israel
and this is the blessing wherewith moses the man of god blessed the children of israel before his death
and he said the lord came from sinai and rose up from seir unto them he shined forth from mount paran and he came with ten thousands of saints from his right hand went a fiery law for them
yea he loved the people all his saints are in thy hand and they sat down at thy feet every one shall receive of thy words
moses commanded us a law even the inheritance of the congregation of jacob
and he was king in jeshurun when the heads of the people and the tribes of israel were gathered together
let reuben live and not die and let not his men be few
and this is the blessing of judah and he said hear lord the voice of judah and bring him unto his people let his hands be sufficient for him and be thou an help to him from his enemies
and of levi he said let thy thummim and thy urim be with thy holy one whom thou didst prove at massah and with whom thou didst strive at the waters of meribah
who said unto his father and to his mother i have not seen him neither did he acknowledge his brethren nor knew his own children for they have observed thy word and kept thy covenant
they shall teach jacob thy judgments and israel thy law they shall put incense before thee and whole burnt sacrifice upon thine altar
bless lord his substance and accept the work of his hands smite through the loins of them that rise against him and of them that hate him that they rise not again
and of benjamin he said the beloved of the lord shall dwell in safety by him and the lord shall cover him all the day long and he shall dwell between his shoulders
and of joseph he said blessed of the lord be his land for the precious things of heaven for the dew and for the deep that coucheth beneath
and for the precious fruits brought forth by the sun and for the precious things put forth by the moon
and for the chief things of the ancient mountains and for the precious things of the lasting hills
and for the precious things of the earth and fulness thereof and for the good will of him that dwelt in the bush let the blessing come upon the head of joseph and upon the top of the head of him that was separated from his brethren
his glory is like the firstling of his bullock and his horns are like the horns of unicorns with them he shall push the people together to the ends of the earth and they are the ten thousands of ephraim and they are the thousands of manasseh
and of zebulun he said rejoice zebulun in thy going out and issachar in thy tents
they shall call the people unto the mountain there they shall offer sacrifices of righteousness for they shall suck of the abundance of the seas and of treasures hid in the sand
and of gad he said blessed be he that enlargeth gad he dwelleth as a lion and teareth the arm with the crown of the head
and he provided the first part for himself because there in a portion of the lawgiver was he seated and he came with the heads of the people he executed the justice of the lord and his judgments with israel
and of dan he said dan is a lion's whelp he shall leap from bashan
and of naphtali he said o naphtali satisfied with favour and full with the blessing of the lord possess thou the west and the south
and of asher he said let asher be blessed with children let him be acceptable to his brethren and let him dip his foot in oil
thy shoes shall be iron and brass and as thy days so shall thy strength be
there is none like unto the god of jeshurun who rideth upon the heaven in thy help and in his excellency on the sky
the eternal god is thy refuge and underneath are the everlasting arms and he shall thrust out the enemy from before thee and shall say destroy them
israel then shall dwell in safety alone the fountain of jacob shall be upon a land of corn and wine also his heavens shall drop down dew
happy art thou o israel who is like unto thee o people saved by the lord the shield of thy help and who is the sword of thy excellency and thine enemies shall be found liars unto thee and thou shalt tread upon their high places
and moses went up from the plains of moab unto the mountain of nebo to the top of pisgah that is over against jericho and the lord shewed him all the land of gilead unto dan
and all naphtali and the land of ephraim and manasseh and all the land of judah unto the utmost sea
and the south and the plain of the valley of jericho the city of palm trees unto zoar
and the lord said unto him this is the land which i sware unto abraham unto isaac and unto jacob saying i will give it unto thy seed i have caused thee to see it with thine eyes but thou shalt not go over thither
so moses the servant of the lord died there in the land of moab according to the word of the lord
and he buried him in a valley in the land of moab over against bethpeor but no man knoweth of his sepulchre unto this day
and moses was an hundred and twenty years old when he died his eye was not dim nor his natural force abated
and the children of israel wept for moses in the plains of moab thirty days so the days of weeping and mourning for moses were ended
and joshua the son of nun was full of the spirit of wisdom for moses had laid his hands upon him and the children of israel hearkened unto him and did as the lord commanded moses
and there arose not a prophet since in israel like unto moses whom the lord knew face to face
in all the signs and the wonders which the lord sent him to do in the land of egypt to pharaoh and to all his servants and to all his land
and in all that mighty hand and in all the great terror which moses shewed in the sight of all israel
now after the death of moses the servant of the lord it came to pass that the lord spake unto joshua the son of nun moses minister saying
moses my servant is dead now therefore arise go over this jordan thou and all this people unto the land which i do give to them even to the children of israel
every place that the sole of your foot shall tread upon that have i given unto you as i said unto moses
from the wilderness and this lebanon even unto the great river the river euphrates all the land of the hittites and unto the great sea toward the going down of the sun shall be your coast
there shall not any man be able to stand before thee all the days of thy life as i was with moses so i will be with thee i will not fail thee nor forsake thee
be strong and of a good courage for unto this people shalt thou divide for an inheritance the land which i sware unto their fathers to give them
only be thou strong and very courageous that thou mayest observe to do according to all the law which moses my servant commanded thee turn not from it to the right hand or to the left that thou mayest prosper whithersoever thou goest
this book of the law shall not depart out of thy mouth but thou shalt meditate therein day and night that thou mayest observe to do according to all that is written therein for then thou shalt make thy way prosperous and then thou shalt have good success
have not i commanded thee be strong and of a good courage be not afraid neither be thou dismayed for the lord thy god is with thee whithersoever thou goest
then joshua commanded the officers of the people saying
pass through the host and command the people saying prepare you victuals for within three days ye shall pass over this jordan to go in to possess the land which the lord your god giveth you to possess it
and to the reubenites and to the gadites and to half the tribe of manasseh spake joshua saying
remember the word which moses the servant of the lord commanded you saying the lord your god hath given you rest and hath given you this land
your wives your little ones and your cattle shall remain in the land which moses gave you on this side jordan but ye shall pass before your brethren armed all the mighty men of valour and help them
until the lord have given your brethren rest as he hath given you and they also have possessed the land which the lord your god giveth them then ye shall return unto the land of your possession and enjoy it which moses the lord's servant gave you on this side jordan toward the sunrising
and they answered joshua saying all that thou commandest us we will do and whithersoever thou sendest us we will go
according as we hearkened unto moses in all things so will we hearken unto thee only the lord thy god be with thee as he was with moses
whosoever he be that doth rebel against thy commandment and will not hearken unto thy words in all that thou commandest him he shall be put to death only be strong and of a good courage
and joshua the son of nun sent out of shittim two men to spy secretly saying go view the land even jericho and they went and came into an harlot's house named rahab and lodged there
and it was told the king of jericho saying behold there came men in hither to night of the children of israel to search out the country
and the king of jericho sent unto rahab saying bring forth the men that are come to thee which are entered into thine house for they be come to search out all the country
and the woman took the two men and hid them and said thus there came men unto me but i wist not whence they were
and it came to pass about the time of shutting of the gate when it was dark that the men went out whither the men went i wot not pursue after them quickly for ye shall overtake them
but she had brought them up to the roof of the house and hid them with the stalks of flax which she had laid in order upon the roof
and the men pursued after them the way to jordan unto the fords and as soon as they which pursued after them were gone out they shut the gate
and before they were laid down she came up unto them upon the roof
and she said unto the men i know that the lord hath given you the land and that your terror is fallen upon us and that all the inhabitants of the land faint because of you
for we have heard how the lord dried up the water of the red sea for you when ye came out of egypt and what ye did unto the two kings of the amorites that were on the other side jordan sihon and og whom ye utterly destroyed
and as soon as we had heard these things our hearts did melt neither did there remain any more courage in any man because of you for the lord your god he is god in heaven above and in earth beneath
now therefore i pray you swear unto me by the lord since i have shewed you kindness that ye will also shew kindness unto my father's house and give me a true token
and that ye will save alive my father and my mother and my brethren and my sisters and all that they have and deliver our lives from death
and the men answered her our life for yours if ye utter not this our business and it shall be when the lord hath given us the land that we will deal kindly and truly with thee
then she let them down by a cord through the window for her house was upon the town wall and she dwelt upon the wall
and she said unto them get you to the mountain lest the pursuers meet you and hide yourselves there three days until the pursuers be returned and afterward may ye go your way
and the men said unto her we will be blameless of this thine oath which thou hast made us swear
behold when we come into the land thou shalt bind this line of scarlet thread in the window which thou didst let us down by and thou shalt bring thy father and thy mother and thy brethren and all thy father's household home unto thee
and it shall be that whosoever shall go out of the doors of thy house into the street his blood shall be upon his head and we will be guiltless and whosoever shall be with thee in the house his blood shall be on our head if any hand be upon him
and if thou utter this our business then we will be quit of thine oath which thou hast made us to swear
and she said according unto your words so be it and she sent them away and they departed and she bound the scarlet line in the window
and they went and came unto the mountain and abode there three days until the pursuers were returned and the pursuers sought them throughout all the way but found them not
so the two men returned and descended from the mountain and passed over and came to joshua the son of nun and told him all things that befell them
and they said unto joshua truly the lord hath delivered into our hands all the land for even all the inhabitants of the country do faint because of us
and joshua rose early in the morning and they removed from shittim and came to jordan he and all the children of israel and lodged there before they passed over
and it came to pass after three days that the officers went through the host
and they commanded the people saying when ye see the ark of the covenant of the lord your god and the priests the levites bearing it then ye shall remove from your place and go after it
yet there shall be a space between you and it about two thousand cubits by measure come not near unto it that ye may know the way by which ye must go for ye have not passed this way heretofore
and joshua said unto the people sanctify yourselves for to morrow the lord will do wonders among you
and joshua spake unto the priests saying take up the ark of the covenant and pass over before the people and they took up the ark of the covenant and went before the people
and the lord said unto joshua this day will i begin to magnify thee in the sight of all israel that they may know that as i was with moses so i will be with thee
and thou shalt command the priests that bear the ark of the covenant saying when ye are come to the brink of the water of jordan ye shall stand still in jordan
and joshua said unto the children of israel come hither and hear the words of the lord your god
and joshua said hereby ye shall know that the living god is among you and that he will without fail drive out from before you the canaanites and the hittites and the hivites and the perizzites and the girgashites and the amorites and the jebusites
behold the ark of the covenant of the lord of all the earth passeth over before you into jordan
now therefore take you twelve men out of the tribes of israel out of every tribe a man
and it shall come to pass as soon as the soles of the feet of the priests that bear the ark of the lord the lord of all the earth shall rest in the waters of jordan that the waters of jordan shall be cut off from the waters that come down from above and they shall stand upon an heap
and it came to pass when the people removed from their tents to pass over jordan and the priests bearing the ark of the covenant before the people
and as they that bare the ark were come unto jordan and the feet of the priests that bare the ark were dipped in the brim of the water for jordan overfloweth all his banks all the time of harvest
that the waters which came down from above stood and rose up upon an heap very far from the city adam that is beside zaretan and those that came down toward the sea of the plain even the salt sea failed and were cut off and the people passed over right against jericho
and the priests that bare the ark of the covenant of the lord stood firm on dry ground in the midst of jordan and all the israelites passed over on dry ground until all the people were passed clean over jordan
and it came to pass when all the people were clean passed over jordan that the lord spake unto joshua saying
take you twelve men out of the people out of every tribe a man
and command ye them saying take you hence out of the midst of jordan out of the place where the priests feet stood firm twelve stones and ye shall carry them over with you and leave them in the lodging place where ye shall lodge this night
then joshua called the twelve men whom he had prepared of the children of israel out of every tribe a man
and joshua said unto them pass over before the ark of the lord your god into the midst of jordan and take you up every man of you a stone upon his shoulder according unto the number of the tribes of the children of israel
that this may be a sign among you that when your children ask their fathers in time to come saying what mean ye by these stones
then ye shall answer them that the waters of jordan were cut off before the ark of the covenant of the lord when it passed over jordan the waters of jordan were cut off and these stones shall be for a memorial unto the children of israel for ever
and the children of israel did so as joshua commanded and took up twelve stones out of the midst of jordan as the lord spake unto joshua according to the number of the tribes of the children of israel and carried them over with them unto the place where they lodged and laid them down there
and joshua set up twelve stones in the midst of jordan in the place where the feet of the priests which bare the ark of the covenant stood and they are there unto this day
for the priests which bare the ark stood in the midst of jordan until everything was finished that the lord commanded joshua to speak unto the people according to all that moses commanded joshua and the people hasted and passed over
and it came to pass when all the people were clean passed over that the ark of the lord passed over and the priests in the presence of the people
and the children of reuben and the children of gad and half the tribe of manasseh passed over armed before the children of israel as moses spake unto them
about forty thousand prepared for war passed over before the lord unto battle to the plains of jericho
on that day the lord magnified joshua in the sight of all israel and they feared him as they feared moses all the days of his life
and the lord spake unto joshua saying
command the priests that bear the ark of the testimony that they come up out of jordan
joshua therefore commanded the priests saying come ye up out of jordan
and it came to pass when the priests that bare the ark of the covenant of the lord were come up out of the midst of jordan and the soles of the priests feet were lifted up unto the dry land that the waters of jordan returned unto their place and flowed over all his banks as they did before
and the people came up out of jordan on the tenth day of the first month and encamped in gilgal in the east border of jericho
and those twelve stones which they took out of jordan did joshua pitch in gilgal
and he spake unto the children of israel saying when your children shall ask their fathers in time to come saying what mean these stones
then ye shall let your children know saying israel came over this jordan on dry land
for the lord your god dried up the waters of jordan from before you until ye were passed over as the lord your god did to the red sea which he dried up from before us until we were gone over
that all the people of the earth might know the hand of the lord that it is mighty that ye might fear the lord your god for ever
and it came to pass when all the kings of the amorites which were on the side of jordan westward and all the kings of the canaanites which were by the sea heard that the lord had dried up the waters of jordan from before the children of israel until we were passed over that their heart melted neither was there spirit in them any more because of the children of israel
at that time the lord said unto joshua make thee sharp knives and circumcise again the children of israel the second time
and joshua made him sharp knives and circumcised the children of israel at the hill of the foreskins
and this is the cause why joshua did circumcise all the people that came out of egypt that were males even all the men of war died in the wilderness by the way after they came out of egypt
now all the people that came out were circumcised but all the people that were born in the wilderness by the way as they came forth out of egypt them they had not circumcised
for the children of israel walked forty years in the wilderness till all the people that were men of war which came out of egypt were consumed because they obeyed not the voice of the lord unto whom the lord sware that he would not shew them the land which the lord sware unto their fathers that he would give us a land that floweth with milk and honey
and their children whom he raised up in their stead them joshua circumcised for they were uncircumcised because they had not circumcised them by the way
and it came to pass when they had done circumcising all the people that they abode in their places in the camp till they were whole
and the lord said unto joshua this day have i rolled away the reproach of egypt from off you wherefore the name of the place is called gilgal unto this day
and the children of israel encamped in gilgal and kept the passover on the fourteenth day of the month at even in the plains of jericho
and they did eat of the old corn of the land on the morrow after the passover unleavened cakes and parched corn in the selfsame day
and the manna ceased on the morrow after they had eaten of the old corn of the land neither had the children of israel manna any more but they did eat of the fruit of the land of canaan that year
and it came to pass when joshua was by jericho that he lifted up his eyes and looked and behold there stood a man over against him with his sword drawn in his hand and joshua went unto him and said unto him art thou for us or for our adversaries
and he said nay but as captain of the host of the lord am i now come and joshua fell on his face to the earth and did worship and said unto him what saith my lord unto his servant
and the captain of the lord's host said unto joshua loose thy shoe from off thy foot for the place whereon thou standest is holy and joshua did so
now jericho was straitly shut up because of the children of israel none went out and none came in
and the lord said unto joshua see i have given into thine hand jericho and the king thereof and the mighty men of valour
and ye shall compass the city all ye men of war and go round about the city once thus shalt thou do six days
and seven priests shall bear before the ark seven trumpets of rams horns and the seventh day ye shall compass the city seven times and the priests shall blow with the trumpets
and it shall come to pass that when they make a long blast with the ram's horn and when ye hear the sound of the trumpet all the people shall shout with a great shout and the wall of the city shall fall down flat and the people shall ascend up every man straight before him
and joshua the son of nun called the priests and said unto them take up the ark of the covenant and let seven priests bear seven trumpets of rams horns before the ark of the lord
and he said unto the people pass on and compass the city and let him that is armed pass on before the ark of the lord
and it came to pass when joshua had spoken unto the people that the seven priests bearing the seven trumpets of rams horns passed on before the lord and blew with the trumpets and the ark of the covenant of the lord followed them
and the armed men went before the priests that blew with the trumpets and the rereward came after the ark the priests going on and blowing with the trumpets
and joshua had commanded the people saying ye shall not shout nor make any noise with your voice neither shall any word proceed out of your mouth until the day i bid you shout then shall ye shout
so the ark of the lord compassed the city going about it once and they came into the camp and lodged in the camp
and joshua rose early in the morning and the priests took up the ark of the lord
and seven priests bearing seven trumpets of rams horns before the ark of the lord went on continually and blew with the trumpets and the armed men went before them but the rereward came after the ark of the lord the priests going on and blowing with the trumpets
and the second day they compassed the city once and returned into the camp so they did six days
and it came to pass on the seventh day that they rose early about the dawning of the day and compassed the city after the same manner seven times only on that day they compassed the city seven times
and it came to pass at the seventh time when the priests blew with the trumpets joshua said unto the people shout for the lord hath given you the city
and the city shall be accursed even it and all that are therein to the lord only rahab the harlot shall live she and all that are with her in the house because she hid the messengers that we sent
and ye in any wise keep yourselves from the accursed thing lest ye make yourselves accursed when ye take of the accursed thing and make the camp of israel a curse and trouble it
but all the silver and gold and vessels of brass and iron are consecrated unto the lord they shall come into the treasury of the lord
so the people shouted when the priests blew with the trumpets and it came to pass when the people heard the sound of the trumpet and the people shouted with a great shout that the wall fell down flat so that the people went up into the city every man straight before him and they took the city
and they utterly destroyed all that was in the city both man and woman young and old and ox and sheep and ass with the edge of the sword
but joshua had said unto the two men that had spied out the country go into the harlot's house and bring out thence the woman and all that she hath as ye sware unto her
and the young men that were spies went in and brought out rahab and her father and her mother and her brethren and all that she had and they brought out all her kindred and left them without the camp of israel
and they burnt the city with fire and all that was therein only the silver and the gold and the vessels of brass and of iron they put into the treasury of the house of the lord
and joshua saved rahab the harlot alive and her father's household and all that she had and she dwelleth in israel even unto this day because she hid the messengers which joshua sent to spy out jericho
and joshua adjured them at that time saying cursed be the man before the lord that riseth up and buildeth this city jericho he shall lay the foundation thereof in his firstborn and in his youngest son shall he set up the gates of it
so the lord was with joshua and his fame was noised throughout all the country
but the children of israel committed a trespass in the accursed thing for achan the son of carmi the son of zabdi the son of zerah of the tribe of judah took of the accursed thing and the anger of the lord was kindled against the children of israel
and joshua sent men from jericho to ai which is beside bethaven on the east side of bethel and spake unto them saying go up and view the country and the men went up and viewed ai
and they returned to joshua and said unto him let not all the people go up but let about two or three thousand men go up and smite ai and make not all the people to labour thither for they are but few
so there went up thither of the people about three thousand men and they fled before the men of ai
and the men of ai smote of them about thirty and six men for they chased them from before the gate even unto shebarim and smote them in the going down wherefore the hearts of the people melted and became as water
and joshua rent his clothes and fell to the earth upon his face before the ark of the lord until the eventide he and the elders of israel and put dust upon their heads
and joshua said alas o lord god wherefore hast thou at all brought this people over jordan to deliver us into the hand of the amorites to destroy us would to god we had been content and dwelt on the other side jordan
o lord what shall i say when israel turneth their backs before their enemies
for the canaanites and all the inhabitants of the land shall hear of it and shall environ us round and cut off our name from the earth and what wilt thou do unto thy great name
and the lord said unto joshua get thee up wherefore liest thou thus upon thy face
israel hath sinned and they have also transgressed my covenant which i commanded them for they have even taken of the accursed thing and have also stolen and dissembled also and they have put it even among their own stuff
therefore the children of israel could not stand before their enemies but turned their backs before their enemies because they were accursed neither will i be with you any more except ye destroy the accursed from among you
up sanctify the people and say sanctify yourselves against to morrow for thus saith the lord god of israel there is an accursed thing in the midst of thee o israel thou canst not stand before thine enemies until ye take away the accursed thing from among you
in the morning therefore ye shall be brought according to your tribes and it shall be that the tribe which the lord taketh shall come according to the families thereof and the family which the lord shall take shall come by households and the household which the lord shall take shall come man by man
and it shall be that he that is taken with the accursed thing shall be burnt with fire he and all that he hath because he hath transgressed the covenant of the lord and because he hath wrought folly in israel
so joshua rose up early in the morning and brought israel by their tribes and the tribe of judah was taken
and he brought the family of judah and he took the family of the zarhites and he brought the family of the zarhites man by man and zabdi was taken
and he brought his household man by man and achan the son of carmi the son of zabdi the son of zerah of the tribe of judah was taken
and joshua said unto achan my son give i pray thee glory to the lord god of israel and make confession unto him and tell me now what thou hast done hide it not from me
and achan answered joshua and said indeed i have sinned against the lord god of israel and thus and thus have i done
when i saw among the spoils a goodly babylonish garment and two hundred shekels of silver and a wedge of gold of fifty shekels weight then i coveted them and took them and behold they are hid in the earth in the midst of my tent and the silver under it
