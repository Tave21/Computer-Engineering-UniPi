leontes say it be tis true
camillo no no my lord
leontes it is you lie you lie
 i say thou liest camillo and i hate thee
 pronounce thee a gross lout a mindless slave
 or else a hovering temporizer that
 canst with thine eyes at once see good and evil
 inclining to them both were my wife's liver
 infected as her life she would not live
 the running of one glass
camillo who does infect her
leontes why he that wears her like a medal hanging
 about his neck bohemia who if i
 had servants true about me that bare eyes
 to see alike mine honour as their profits
 their own particular thrifts they would do that
 which should undo more doing ay and thou
 his cupbearerwhom i from meaner form
 have benched and reared to worship who mayst see
 plainly as heaven sees earth and earth sees heaven
 how i am galledmightst bespice a cup
 to give mine enemy a lasting wink
 which draught to me were cordial
camillo sir my lord
 i could do this and that with no rash potion
 but with a lingering dram that should not work
 maliciously like poison but i cannot
 believe this crack to be in my dread mistress
 so sovereignly being honourable
 i have loved thee
leontes make that thy question and go rot
 dost think i am so muddy so unsettled
 to appoint myself in this vexation sully
 the purity and whiteness of my sheets
 which to preserve is sleep which being spotted
 is goads thorns nettles tails of wasps
 give scandal to the blood o the prince my son
 who i do think is mine and love as mine
 without ripe moving to't would i do this
 could man so blench
camillo i must believe you sir
 i do and will fetch off bohemia for't
 provided that when he's removed your highness
 will take again your queen as yours at first
 even for your son's sake and thereby for sealing
 the injury of tongues in courts and kingdoms
 known and allied to yours
leontes thou dost advise me
 even so as i mine own course have set down
 i'll give no blemish to her honour none
camillo my lord
 go then and with a countenance as clear
 as friendship wears at feasts keep with bohemia
 and with your queen i am his cupbearer
 if from me he have wholesome beverage
 account me not your servant
leontes this is all
 do't and thou hast the one half of my heart
 do't not thou split'st thine own
camillo i'll do't my lord
leontes i will seem friendly as thou hast advised me
 exit
camillo o miserable lady but for me
 what case stand i in i must be the poisoner
 of good polixenes and my ground to do't
 is the obedience to a master one
 who in rebellion with himself will have
 all that are his so too to do this deed
 promotion follows if i could find example
 of thousands that had struck anointed kings
 and flourish'd after i'ld not do't but since
 nor brass nor stone nor parchment bears not one
 let villany itself forswear't i must
 forsake the court to do't or no is certain
 to me a breakneck happy star reign now
 here comes bohemia
 reenter polixenes
polixenes this is strange methinks
 my favour here begins to warp not speak
 good day camillo
camillo hail most royal sir
polixenes what is the news i the court
camillo none rare my lord
polixenes the king hath on him such a countenance
 as he had lost some province and a region
 loved as he loves himself even now i met him
 with customary compliment when he
 wafting his eyes to the contrary and falling
 a lip of much contempt speeds from me and
 so leaves me to consider what is breeding
 that changeth thus his manners
camillo i dare not know my lord
polixenes how dare not do not do you know and dare not
 be intelligent to me tis thereabouts
 for to yourself what you do know you must
 and cannot say you dare not good camillo
 your changed complexions are to me a mirror
 which shows me mine changed too for i must be
 a party in this alteration finding
 myself thus alter'd with t
camillo there is a sickness
 which puts some of us in distemper but
 i cannot name the disease and it is caught
 of you that yet are well
polixenes how caught of me
 make me not sighted like the basilisk
 i have look'd on thousands who have sped the better
 by my regard but kill'd none so camillo
 as you are certainly a gentleman thereto
 clerklike experienced which no less adorns
 our gentry than our parents noble names
 in whose success we are gentlei beseech you
 if you know aught which does behove my knowledge
 thereof to be inform'd imprison't not
 in ignorant concealment
camillo i may not answer
polixenes a sickness caught of me and yet i well
 i must be answer'd dost thou hear camillo
 i conjure thee by all the parts of man
 which honour does acknowledge whereof the least
 is not this suit of mine that thou declare
 what incidency thou dost guess of harm
 is creeping toward me how far off how near
 which way to be prevented if to be
 if not how best to bear it
camillo sir i will tell you
 since i am charged in honour and by him
 that i think honourable therefore mark my counsel
 which must be even as swiftly follow'd as
 i mean to utter it or both yourself and me
 cry lost and so good night
polixenes on good camillo
camillo i am appointed him to murder you
polixenes by whom camillo
camillo by the king
polixenes for what
camillo he thinks nay with all confidence he swears
 as he had seen't or been an instrument
 to vice you to't that you have touch'd his queen
 forbiddenly
polixenes o then my best blood turn
 to an infected jelly and my name
 be yoked with his that did betray the best
 turn then my freshest reputation to
 a savour that may strike the dullest nostril
 where i arrive and my approach be shunn'd
 nay hated too worse than the great'st infection
 that e'er was heard or read
camillo swear his thought over
 by each particular star in heaven and
 by all their influences you may as well
 forbid the sea for to obey the moon
 as or by oath remove or counsel shake
 the fabric of his folly whose foundation
 is piled upon his faith and will continue
 the standing of his body
polixenes how should this grow
camillo i know not but i am sure tis safer to
 avoid what's grown than question how tis born
 if therefore you dare trust my honesty
 that lies enclosed in this trunk which you
 shall bear along impawn'd away tonight
 your followers i will whisper to the business
 and will by twos and threes at several posterns
 clear them o the city for myself i'll put
 my fortunes to your service which are here
 by this discovery lost be not uncertain
 for by the honour of my parents i
 have utter'd truth which if you seek to prove
 i dare not stand by nor shall you be safer
 than one condemn'd by the king's own mouth thereon
 his execution sworn
polixenes i do believe thee
 i saw his heart in s face give me thy hand
 be pilot to me and thy places shall
 still neighbour mine my ships are ready and
 my people did expect my hence departure
 two days ago this jealousy
 is for a precious creature as she's rare
 must it be great and as his person's mighty
 must it be violent and as he does conceive
 he is dishonour'd by a man which ever
 profess'd to him why his revenges must
 in that be made more bitter fear o'ershades me
 good expedition be my friend and comfort
 the gracious queen part of his theme but nothing
 of his illta'en suspicion come camillo
 i will respect thee as a father if
 thou bear'st my life off hence let us avoid
camillo it is in mine authority to command
 the keys of all the posterns please your highness
 to take the urgent hour come sir away
 exeunt
 the winter's tale
act ii
scene i a room in leontes palace
 enter hermione mamillius and ladies
hermione take the boy to you he so troubles me
 tis past enduring
first lady come my gracious lord
