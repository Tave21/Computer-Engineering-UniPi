and led him away to annas first for he was father in law to caiaphas which was the high priest that same year
now caiaphas was he which gave counsel to the jews that it was expedient that one man should die for the people
and simon peter followed jesus and so did another disciple that disciple was known unto the high priest and went in with jesus into the palace of the high priest
but peter stood at the door without then went out that other disciple which was known unto the high priest and spake unto her that kept the door and brought in peter
then saith the damsel that kept the door unto peter art not thou also one of this man's disciples he saith i am not
and the servants and officers stood there who had made a fire of coals for it was cold and they warmed themselves and peter stood with them and warmed himself
the high priest then asked jesus of his disciples and of his doctrine
jesus answered him i spake openly to the world i ever taught in the synagogue and in the temple whither the jews always resort and in secret have i said nothing
why askest thou me ask them which heard me what i have said unto them behold they know what i said
and when he had thus spoken one of the officers which stood by struck jesus with the palm of his hand saying answerest thou the high priest so
jesus answered him if i have spoken evil bear witness of the evil but if well why smitest thou me
now annas had sent him bound unto caiaphas the high priest
and simon peter stood and warmed himself they said therefore unto him art not thou also one of his disciples he denied it and said i am not
one of the servants of the high priest being his kinsman whose ear peter cut off saith did not i see thee in the garden with him
peter then denied again and immediately the cock crew
then led they jesus from caiaphas unto the hall of judgment and it was early and they themselves went not into the judgment hall lest they should be defiled but that they might eat the passover
pilate then went out unto them and said what accusation bring ye against this man
they answered and said unto him if he were not a malefactor we would not have delivered him up unto thee
then said pilate unto them take ye him and judge him according to your law the jews therefore said unto him it is not lawful for us to put any man to death
that the saying of jesus might be fulfilled which he spake signifying what death he should die
then pilate entered into the judgment hall again and called jesus and said unto him art thou the king of the jews
jesus answered him sayest thou this thing of thyself or did others tell it thee of me
pilate answered am i a jew thine own nation and the chief priests have delivered thee unto me what hast thou done
jesus answered my kingdom is not of this world if my kingdom were of this world then would my servants fight that i should not be delivered to the jews but now is my kingdom not from hence
pilate therefore said unto him art thou a king then jesus answered thou sayest that i am a king to this end was i born and for this cause came i into the world that i should bear witness unto the truth every one that is of the truth heareth my voice
pilate saith unto him what is truth and when he had said this he went out again unto the jews and saith unto them i find in him no fault at all
but ye have a custom that i should release unto you one at the passover will ye therefore that i release unto you the king of the jews
then cried they all again saying not this man but barabbas now barabbas was a robber
then pilate therefore took jesus and scourged him
and the soldiers platted a crown of thorns and put it on his head and they put on him a purple robe
and said hail king of the jews and they smote him with their hands
pilate therefore went forth again and saith unto them behold i bring him forth to you that ye may know that i find no fault in him
then came jesus forth wearing the crown of thorns and the purple robe and pilate saith unto them behold the man
when the chief priests therefore and officers saw him they cried out saying crucify him crucify him pilate saith unto them take ye him and crucify him for i find no fault in him
the jews answered him we have a law and by our law he ought to die because he made himself the son of god
when pilate therefore heard that saying he was the more afraid
and went again into the judgment hall and saith unto jesus whence art thou but jesus gave him no answer
then saith pilate unto him speakest thou not unto me knowest thou not that i have power to crucify thee and have power to release thee
jesus answered thou couldest have no power at all against me except it were given thee from above therefore he that delivered me unto thee hath the greater sin
and from thenceforth pilate sought to release him but the jews cried out saying if thou let this man go thou art not caesar's friend whosoever maketh himself a king speaketh against caesar
when pilate therefore heard that saying he brought jesus forth and sat down in the judgment seat in a place that is called the pavement but in the hebrew gabbatha
and it was the preparation of the passover and about the sixth hour and he saith unto the jews behold your king
but they cried out away with him away with him crucify him pilate saith unto them shall i crucify your king the chief priests answered we have no king but caesar
then delivered he him therefore unto them to be crucified and they took jesus and led him away
and he bearing his cross went forth into a place called the place of a skull which is called in the hebrew golgotha
where they crucified him and two other with him on either side one and jesus in the midst
and pilate wrote a title and put it on the cross and the writing was jesus of nazareth the king of the jews
this title then read many of the jews for the place where jesus was crucified was nigh to the city and it was written in hebrew and greek and latin
then said the chief priests of the jews to pilate write not the king of the jews but that he said i am king of the jews
pilate answered what i have written i have written
then the soldiers when they had crucified jesus took his garments and made four parts to every soldier a part and also his coat now the coat was without seam woven from the top throughout
they said therefore among themselves let us not rend it but cast lots for it whose it shall be that the scripture might be fulfilled which saith they parted my raiment among them and for my vesture they did cast lots these things therefore the soldiers did
now there stood by the cross of jesus his mother and his mother's sister mary the wife of cleophas and mary magdalene
when jesus therefore saw his mother and the disciple standing by whom he loved he saith unto his mother woman behold thy son
then saith he to the disciple behold thy mother and from that hour that disciple took her unto his own home
after this jesus knowing that all things were now accomplished that the scripture might be fulfilled saith i thirst
now there was set a vessel full of vinegar and they filled a spunge with vinegar and put it upon hyssop and put it to his mouth
when jesus therefore had received the vinegar he said it is finished and he bowed his head and gave up the ghost
the jews therefore because it was the preparation that the bodies should not remain upon the cross on the sabbath day for that sabbath day was an high day besought pilate that their legs might be broken and that they might be taken away
then came the soldiers and brake the legs of the first and of the other which was crucified with him
but when they came to jesus and saw that he was dead already they brake not his legs
but one of the soldiers with a spear pierced his side and forthwith came there out blood and water
and he that saw it bare record and his record is true and he knoweth that he saith true that ye might believe
for these things were done that the scripture should be fulfilled a bone of him shall not be broken
and again another scripture saith they shall look on him whom they pierced
and after this joseph of arimathaea being a disciple of jesus but secretly for fear of the jews besought pilate that he might take away the body of jesus and pilate gave him leave he came therefore and took the body of jesus
and there came also nicodemus which at the first came to jesus by night and brought a mixture of myrrh and aloes about an hundred pound weight
then took they the body of jesus and wound it in linen clothes with the spices as the manner of the jews is to bury
now in the place where he was crucified there was a garden and in the garden a new sepulchre wherein was never man yet laid
there laid they jesus therefore because of the jews preparation day for the sepulchre was nigh at hand
the first day of the week cometh mary magdalene early when it was yet dark unto the sepulchre and seeth the stone taken away from the sepulchre
then she runneth and cometh to simon peter and to the other disciple whom jesus loved and saith unto them they have taken away the lord out of the sepulchre and we know not where they have laid him
peter therefore went forth and that other disciple and came to the sepulchre
so they ran both together and the other disciple did outrun peter and came first to the sepulchre
and he stooping down and looking in saw the linen clothes lying yet went he not in
then cometh simon peter following him and went into the sepulchre and seeth the linen clothes lie
and the napkin that was about his head not lying with the linen clothes but wrapped together in a place by itself
then went in also that other disciple which came first to the sepulchre and he saw and believed
for as yet they knew not the scripture that he must rise again from the dead
then the disciples went away again unto their own home
but mary stood without at the sepulchre weeping and as she wept she stooped down and looked into the sepulchre
and seeth two angels in white sitting the one at the head and the other at the feet where the body of jesus had lain
and they say unto her woman why weepest thou she saith unto them because they have taken away my lord and i know not where they have laid him
and when she had thus said she turned herself back and saw jesus standing and knew not that it was jesus
jesus saith unto her woman why weepest thou whom seekest thou she supposing him to be the gardener saith unto him sir if thou have borne him hence tell me where thou hast laid him and i will take him away
jesus saith unto her mary she turned herself and saith unto him rabboni which is to say master
jesus saith unto her touch me not for i am not yet ascended to my father but go to my brethren and say unto them i ascend unto my father and your father and to my god and your god
mary magdalene came and told the disciples that she had seen the lord and that he had spoken these things unto her
then the same day at evening being the first day of the week when the doors were shut where the disciples were assembled for fear of the jews came jesus and stood in the midst and saith unto them peace be unto you
and when he had so said he shewed unto them his hands and his side then were the disciples glad when they saw the lord
then said jesus to them again peace be unto you as my father hath sent me even so send i you
and when he had said this he breathed on them and saith unto them receive ye the holy ghost
whose soever sins ye remit they are remitted unto them and whose soever sins ye retain they are retained
but thomas one of the twelve called didymus was not with them when jesus came
the other disciples therefore said unto him we have seen the lord but he said unto them except i shall see in his hands the print of the nails and put my finger into the print of the nails and thrust my hand into his side i will not believe
and after eight days again his disciples were within and thomas with them then came jesus the doors being shut and stood in the midst and said peace be unto you
then saith he to thomas reach hither thy finger and behold my hands and reach hither thy hand and thrust it into my side and be not faithless but believing
and thomas answered and said unto him my lord and my god
jesus saith unto him thomas because thou hast seen me thou hast believed blessed are they that have not seen and yet have believed
and many other signs truly did jesus in the presence of his disciples which are not written in this book
but these are written that ye might believe that jesus is the christ the son of god and that believing ye might have life through his name
after these things jesus shewed himself again to the disciples at the sea of tiberias and on this wise shewed he himself
there were together simon peter and thomas called didymus and nathanael of cana in galilee and the sons of zebedee and two other of his disciples
simon peter saith unto them i go a fishing they say unto him we also go with thee they went forth and entered into a ship immediately and that night they caught nothing
but when the morning was now come jesus stood on the shore but the disciples knew not that it was jesus
then jesus saith unto them children have ye any meat they answered him no
and he said unto them cast the net on the right side of the ship and ye shall find they cast therefore and now they were not able to draw it for the multitude of fishes
therefore that disciple whom jesus loved saith unto peter it is the lord now when simon peter heard that it was the lord he girt his fisher's coat unto him for he was naked and did cast himself into the sea
and the other disciples came in a little ship for they were not far from land but as it were two hundred cubits dragging the net with fishes
as soon then as they were come to land they saw a fire of coals there and fish laid thereon and bread
jesus saith unto them bring of the fish which ye have now caught
simon peter went up and drew the net to land full of great fishes an hundred and fifty and three and for all there were so many yet was not the net broken
jesus saith unto them come and dine and none of the disciples durst ask him who art thou knowing that it was the lord
jesus then cometh and taketh bread and giveth them and fish likewise
this is now the third time that jesus shewed himself to his disciples after that he was risen from the dead
so when they had dined jesus saith to simon peter simon son of jonas lovest thou me more than these he saith unto him yea lord thou knowest that i love thee he saith unto him feed my lambs
he saith to him again the second time simon son of jonas lovest thou me he saith unto him yea lord thou knowest that i love thee he saith unto him feed my sheep
he saith unto him the third time simon son of jonas lovest thou me peter was grieved because he said unto him the third time lovest thou me and he said unto him lord thou knowest all things thou knowest that i love thee jesus saith unto him feed my sheep
verily verily i say unto thee when thou wast young thou girdedst thyself and walkedst whither thou wouldest but when thou shalt be old thou shalt stretch forth thy hands and another shall gird thee and carry thee whither thou wouldest not
this spake he signifying by what death he should glorify god and when he had spoken this he saith unto him follow me
then peter turning about seeth the disciple whom jesus loved following which also leaned on his breast at supper and said lord which is he that betrayeth thee
peter seeing him saith to jesus lord and what shall this man do
jesus saith unto him if i will that he tarry till i come what is that to thee follow thou me
then went this saying abroad among the brethren that that disciple should not die yet jesus said not unto him he shall not die but if i will that he tarry till i come what is that to thee
this is the disciple which testifieth of these things and wrote these things and we know that his testimony is true
and there are also many other things which jesus did the which if they should be written every one i suppose that even the world itself could not contain the books that should be written amen
the former treatise have i made o theophilus of all that jesus began both to do and teach
until the day in which he was taken up after that he through the holy ghost had given commandments unto the apostles whom he had chosen
to whom also he shewed himself alive after his passion by many infallible proofs being seen of them forty days and speaking of the things pertaining to the kingdom of god
and being assembled together with them commanded them that they should not depart from jerusalem but wait for the promise of the father which saith he ye have heard of me
for john truly baptized with water but ye shall be baptized with the holy ghost not many days hence
when they therefore were come together they asked of him saying lord wilt thou at this time restore again the kingdom to israel
and he said unto them it is not for you to know the times or the seasons which the father hath put in his own power
but ye shall receive power after that the holy ghost is come upon you and ye shall be witnesses unto me both in jerusalem and in all judaea and in samaria and unto the uttermost part of the earth
and when he had spoken these things while they beheld he was taken up and a cloud received him out of their sight
and while they looked stedfastly toward heaven as he went up behold two men stood by them in white apparel
which also said ye men of galilee why stand ye gazing up into heaven this same jesus which is taken up from you into heaven shall so come in like manner as ye have seen him go into heaven
then returned they unto jerusalem from the mount called olivet which is from jerusalem a sabbath day's journey
and when they were come in they went up into an upper room where abode both peter and james and john and andrew philip and thomas bartholomew and matthew james the son of alphaeus and simon zelotes and judas the brother of james
these all continued with one accord in prayer and supplication with the women and mary the mother of jesus and with his brethren
and in those days peter stood up in the midst of the disciples and said the number of names together were about an hundred and twenty
men and brethren this scripture must needs have been fulfilled which the holy ghost by the mouth of david spake before concerning judas which was guide to them that took jesus
for he was numbered with us and had obtained part of this ministry
now this man purchased a field with the reward of iniquity and falling headlong he burst asunder in the midst and all his bowels gushed out
and it was known unto all the dwellers at jerusalem insomuch as that field is called in their proper tongue aceldama that is to say the field of blood
for it is written in the book of psalms let his habitation be desolate and let no man dwell therein and his bishoprick let another take
wherefore of these men which have companied with us all the time that the lord jesus went in and out among us
beginning from the baptism of john unto that same day that he was taken up from us must one be ordained to be a witness with us of his resurrection
and they appointed two joseph called barsabas who was surnamed justus and matthias
and they prayed and said thou lord which knowest the hearts of all men shew whether of these two thou hast chosen
that he may take part of this ministry and apostleship from which judas by transgression fell that he might go to his own place
and they gave forth their lots and the lot fell upon matthias and he was numbered with the eleven apostles
and when the day of pentecost was fully come they were all with one accord in one place
and suddenly there came a sound from heaven as of a rushing mighty wind and it filled all the house where they were sitting
and there appeared unto them cloven tongues like as of fire and it sat upon each of them
and they were all filled with the holy ghost and began to speak with other tongues as the spirit gave them utterance
and there were dwelling at jerusalem jews devout men out of every nation under heaven
now when this was noised abroad the multitude came together and were confounded because that every man heard them speak in his own language
and they were all amazed and marvelled saying one to another behold are not all these which speak galilaeans
and how hear we every man in our own tongue wherein we were born
parthians and medes and elamites and the dwellers in mesopotamia and in judaea and cappadocia in pontus and asia
phrygia and pamphylia in egypt and in the parts of libya about cyrene and strangers of rome jews and proselytes
cretes and arabians we do hear them speak in our tongues the wonderful works of god
and they were all amazed and were in doubt saying one to another what meaneth this
others mocking said these men are full of new wine
but peter standing up with the eleven lifted up his voice and said unto them ye men of judaea and all ye that dwell at jerusalem be this known unto you and hearken to my words
for these are not drunken as ye suppose seeing it is but the third hour of the day
but this is that which was spoken by the prophet joel
and it shall come to pass in the last days saith god i will pour out of my spirit upon all flesh and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy and your young men shall see visions and your old men shall dream dreams
and on my servants and on my handmaidens i will pour out in those days of my spirit and they shall prophesy
and i will shew wonders in heaven above and signs in the earth beneath blood and fire and vapour of smoke
the sun shall be turned into darkness and the moon into blood before that great and notable day of the lord come
and it shall come to pass that whosoever shall call on the name of the lord shall be saved
ye men of israel hear these words jesus of nazareth a man approved of god among you by miracles and wonders and signs which god did by him in the midst of you as ye yourselves also know
him being delivered by the determinate counsel and foreknowledge of god ye have taken and by wicked hands have crucified and slain
whom god hath raised up having loosed the pains of death because it was not possible that he should be holden of it
for david speaketh concerning him i foresaw the lord always before my face for he is on my right hand that i should not be moved
therefore did my heart rejoice and my tongue was glad moreover also my flesh shall rest in hope
because thou wilt not leave my soul in hell neither wilt thou suffer thine holy one to see corruption
thou hast made known to me the ways of life thou shalt make me full of joy with thy countenance
men and brethren let me freely speak unto you of the patriarch david that he is both dead and buried and his sepulchre is with us unto this day
therefore being a prophet and knowing that god had sworn with an oath to him that of the fruit of his loins according to the flesh he would raise up christ to sit on his throne
he seeing this before spake of the resurrection of christ that his soul was not left in hell neither his flesh did see corruption
this jesus hath god raised up whereof we all are witnesses
therefore being by the right hand of god exalted and having received of the father the promise of the holy ghost he hath shed forth this which ye now see and hear
for david is not ascended into the heavens but he saith himself the lord said unto my lord sit thou on my right hand
until i make thy foes thy footstool
therefore let all the house of israel know assuredly that god hath made that same jesus whom ye have crucified both lord and christ
now when they heard this they were pricked in their heart and said unto peter and to the rest of the apostles men and brethren what shall we do
then peter said unto them repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of jesus christ for the remission of sins and ye shall receive the gift of the holy ghost
for the promise is unto you and to your children and to all that are afar off even as many as the lord our god shall call
and with many other words did he testify and exhort saying save yourselves from this untoward generation
then they that gladly received his word were baptized and the same day there were added unto them about three thousand souls
and they continued stedfastly in the apostles doctrine and fellowship and in breaking of bread and in prayers
and fear came upon every soul and many wonders and signs were done by the apostles
and all that believed were together and had all things common
and sold their possessions and goods and parted them to all men as every man had need
and they continuing daily with one accord in the temple and breaking bread from house to house did eat their meat with gladness and singleness of heart
praising god and having favour with all the people and the lord added to the church daily such as should be saved
now peter and john went up together into the temple at the hour of prayer being the ninth hour
