 on your imaginary forces work
 suppose within the girdle of these walls
 are now confined two mighty monarchies
 whose high upreared and abutting fronts
 the perilous narrow ocean parts asunder
 piece out our imperfections with your thoughts
 into a thousand parts divide on man
 and make imaginary puissance
 think when we talk of horses that you see them
 printing their proud hoofs i the receiving earth
 for tis your thoughts that now must deck our kings
 carry them here and there jumping o'er times
 turning the accomplishment of many years
 into an hourglass for the which supply
 admit me chorus to this history
 who prologuelike your humble patience pray
 gently to hear kindly to judge our play
 exit
 king henry v
act i
scene i london an antechamber in the king's palace
 enter the archbishop of canterbury and the bishop of ely
canterbury my lord i'll tell you that self bill is urged
 which in the eleventh year of the last king's reign
 was like and had indeed against us pass'd
 but that the scambling and unquiet time
 did push it out of farther question
ely but how my lord shall we resist it now
canterbury it must be thought on if it pass against us
 we lose the better half of our possession
 for all the temporal lands which men devout
 by testament have given to the church
 would they strip from us being valued thus
 as much as would maintain to the king's honour
 full fifteen earls and fifteen hundred knights
 six thousand and two hundred good esquires
 and to relief of lazars and weak age
 of indigent faint souls past corporal toil
 a hundred almshouses right well supplied
 and to the coffers of the king beside
 a thousand pounds by the year thus runs the bill
ely this would drink deep
canterbury twould drink the cup and all
ely but what prevention
canterbury the king is full of grace and fair regard
ely and a true lover of the holy church
canterbury the courses of his youth promised it not
 the breath no sooner left his father's body
 but that his wildness mortified in him
 seem'd to die too yea at that very moment
 consideration like an angel came
 and whipp'd the offending adam out of him
 leaving his body as a paradise
 to envelop and contain celestial spirits
 never was such a sudden scholar made
 never came reformation in a flood
 with such a heady currance scouring faults
 nor never hydraheaded wilfulness
 so soon did lose his seat and all at once
 as in this king
ely we are blessed in the change
canterbury hear him but reason in divinity
 and alladmiring with an inward wish
 you would desire the king were made a prelate
 hear him debate of commonwealth affairs
 you would say it hath been all in all his study
 list his discourse of war and you shall hear
 a fearful battle render'd you in music
 turn him to any cause of policy
 the gordian knot of it he will unloose
 familiar as his garter that when he speaks
 the air a charter'd libertine is still
 and the mute wonder lurketh in men's ears
 to steal his sweet and honey'd sentences
 so that the art and practic part of life
 must be the mistress to this theoric
 which is a wonder how his grace should glean it
 since his addiction was to courses vain
 his companies unletter'd rude and shallow
 his hours fill'd up with riots banquets sports
 and never noted in him any study
 any retirement any sequestration
 from open haunts and popularity
ely the strawberry grows underneath the nettle
 and wholesome berries thrive and ripen best
 neighbour'd by fruit of baser quality
 and so the prince obscured his contemplation
 under the veil of wildness which no doubt
 grew like the summer grass fastest by night
 unseen yet crescive in his faculty
canterbury it must be so for miracles are ceased
 and therefore we must needs admit the means
 how things are perfected
ely but my good lord
 how now for mitigation of this bill
 urged by the commons doth his majesty
 incline to it or no
canterbury he seems indifferent
 or rather swaying more upon our part
 than cherishing the exhibiters against us
 for i have made an offer to his majesty
 upon our spiritual convocation
 and in regard of causes now in hand
 which i have open'd to his grace at large
 as touching france to give a greater sum
 than ever at one time the clergy yet
 did to his predecessors part withal
ely how did this offer seem received my lord
canterbury with good acceptance of his majesty
 save that there was not time enough to hear
 as i perceived his grace would fain have done
 the severals and unhidden passages
 of his true titles to some certain dukedoms
 and generally to the crown and seat of france
 derived from edward his greatgrandfather
ely what was the impediment that broke this off
canterbury the french ambassador upon that instant
 craved audience and the hour i think is come
 to give him hearing is it four o'clock
ely it is
canterbury then go we in to know his embassy
 which i could with a ready guess declare
 before the frenchman speak a word of it
ely i'll wait upon you and i long to hear it

 king henry v
act i
scene ii the same the presence chamber
 enter king henry v gloucester bedford exeter
 warwick westmoreland and attendants
king henry v where is my gracious lord of canterbury
exeter not here in presence
king henry v send for him good uncle
westmoreland shall we call in the ambassador my liege
king henry v not yet my cousin we would be resolved
 before we hear him of some things of weight
 that task our thoughts concerning us and france
 enter the archbishop of canterbury and the bishop of ely
canterbury god and his angels guard your sacred throne
 and make you long become it
king henry v sure we thank you
 my learned lord we pray you to proceed
 and justly and religiously unfold
 why the law salique that they have in france
 or should or should not bar us in our claim
 and god forbid my dear and faithful lord
 that you should fashion wrest or bow your reading
 or nicely charge your understanding soul
 with opening titles miscreate whose right
 suits not in native colours with the truth
 for god doth know how many now in health
 shall drop their blood in approbation
 of what your reverence shall incite us to
 therefore take heed how you impawn our person
 how you awake our sleeping sword of war
 we charge you in the name of god take heed
 for never two such kingdoms did contend
 without much fall of blood whose guiltless drops
 are every one a woe a sore complaint
 gainst him whose wrong gives edge unto the swords
 that make such waste in brief mortality
 under this conjuration speak my lord
 for we will hear note and believe in heart
 that what you speak is in your conscience wash'd
 as pure as sin with baptism
canterbury then hear me gracious sovereign and you peers
 that owe yourselves your lives and services
 to this imperial throne there is no bar
 to make against your highness claim to france
 but this which they produce from pharamond
 in terram salicam mulieres ne succedant'
 no woman shall succeed in salique land'
 which salique land the french unjustly gloze
 to be the realm of france and pharamond
 the founder of this law and female bar
 yet their own authors faithfully affirm
 that the land salique is in germany
 between the floods of sala and of elbe
 where charles the great having subdued the saxons
 there left behind and settled certain french
 who holding in disdain the german women
 for some dishonest manners of their life
 establish'd then this law to wit no female
 should be inheritrix in salique land
 which salique as i said twixt elbe and sala
 is at this day in germany call'd meisen
 then doth it well appear that salique law
 was not devised for the realm of france
 nor did the french possess the salique land
 until four hundred one and twenty years
 after defunction of king pharamond
 idly supposed the founder of this law
 who died within the year of our redemption
 four hundred twentysix and charles the great
 subdued the saxons and did seat the french
 beyond the river sala in the year
 eight hundred five besides their writers say
 king pepin which deposed childeric
 did as heir general being descended
 of blithild which was daughter to king clothair
