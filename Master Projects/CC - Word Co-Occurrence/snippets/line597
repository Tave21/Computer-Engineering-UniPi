 shall i be your playfellow
mamillius no i'll none of you
first lady why my sweet lord
mamillius you'll kiss me hard and speak to me as if
 i were a baby still i love you better
second lady and why so my lord
mamillius not for because
 your brows are blacker yet black brows they say
 become some women best so that there be not
 too much hair there but in a semicircle
 or a halfmoon made with a pen
second lady who taught you this
mamillius i learnt it out of women's faces pray now
 what colour are your eyebrows
first lady blue my lord
mamillius nay that's a mock i have seen a lady's nose
 that has been blue but not her eyebrows
first lady hark ye
 the queen your mother rounds apace we shall
 present our services to a fine new prince
 one of these days and then you'ld wanton with us
 if we would have you
second lady she is spread of late
 into a goodly bulk good time encounter her
hermione what wisdom stirs amongst you come sir now
 i am for you again pray you sit by us
 and tell s a tale
mamillius merry or sad shall't be
hermione as merry as you will
mamillius a sad tale's best for winter i have one
 of sprites and goblins
hermione let's have that good sir
 come on sit down come on and do your best
 to fright me with your sprites you're powerful at it
mamillius there was a man
hermione nay come sit down then on
mamillius dwelt by a churchyard i will tell it softly
 yond crickets shall not hear it
hermione come on then
 and give't me in mine ear
 enter leontes with antigonus lords and others
leontes was he met there his train camillo with him
first lord behind the tuft of pines i met them never
 saw i men scour so on their way i eyed them
 even to their ships
leontes how blest am i
 in my just censure in my true opinion
 alack for lesser knowledge how accursed
 in being so blest there may be in the cup
 a spider steep'd and one may drink depart
 and yet partake no venom for his knowledge
 is not infected but if one present
 the abhorr'd ingredient to his eye make known
 how he hath drunk he cracks his gorge his sides
 with violent hefts i have drunk
 and seen the spider
 camillo was his help in this his pander
 there is a plot against my life my crown
 all's true that is mistrusted that false villain
 whom i employ'd was preemploy'd by him
 he has discover'd my design and i
 remain a pinch'd thing yea a very trick
 for them to play at will how came the posterns
 so easily open
first lord by his great authority
 which often hath no less prevail'd than so
 on your command
leontes i know't too well
 give me the boy i am glad you did not nurse him
 though he does bear some signs of me yet you
 have too much blood in him
hermione what is this sport
leontes bear the boy hence he shall not come about her
 away with him and let her sport herself
 with that she's big with for tis polixenes
 has made thee swell thus
hermione but i'ld say he had not
 and i'll be sworn you would believe my saying
 howe'er you lean to the nayward
leontes you my lords
 look on her mark her well be but about
 to say she is a goodly lady and
 the justice of your bearts will thereto add
 tis pity she's not honest honourable'
 praise her but for this her withoutdoor form
 which on my faith deserves high speech and straight
 the shrug the hum or ha these petty brands
 that calumny doth useo i am out
 that mercy does for calumny will sear
 virtue itself these shrugs these hums and ha's
 when you have said she's goodly come between
 ere you can say she's honest but be t known
 from him that has most cause to grieve it should be
 she's an adulteress
hermione should a villain say so
 the most replenish'd villain in the world
 he were as much more villain you my lord
 do but mistake
leontes you have mistook my lady
 polixenes for leontes o thou thing
 which i'll not call a creature of thy place
 lest barbarism making me the precedent
 should a like language use to all degrees
 and mannerly distinguishment leave out
 betwixt the prince and beggar i have said
 she's an adulteress i have said with whom
 more she's a traitor and camillo is
 a federary with her and one that knows
 what she should shame to know herself
 but with her most vile principal that she's
 a bedswerver even as bad as those
 that vulgars give bold'st titles ay and privy
 to this their late escape
hermione no by my life
 privy to none of this how will this grieve you
 when you shall come to clearer knowledge that
 you thus have publish'd me gentle my lord
 you scarce can right me throughly then to say
 you did mistake
leontes no if i mistake
 in those foundations which i build upon
 the centre is not big enough to bear
 a schoolboy's top away with her to prison
 he who shall speak for her is afar off guilty
 but that he speaks
hermione there's some ill planet reigns
 i must be patient till the heavens look
 with an aspect more favourable good my lords
 i am not prone to weeping as our sex
 commonly are the want of which vain dew
 perchance shall dry your pities but i have
 that honourable grief lodged here which burns
 worse than tears drown beseech you all my lords
 with thoughts so qualified as your charities
 shall best instruct you measure me and so
 the king's will be perform'd
leontes shall i be heard
hermione who is't that goes with me beseech your highness
 my women may be with me for you see
 my plight requires it do not weep good fools
 there is no cause when you shall know your mistress
 has deserved prison then abound in tears
 as i come out this action i now go on
 is for my better grace adieu my lord
 i never wish'd to see you sorry now
 i trust i shall my women come you have leave
leontes go do our bidding hence
 exit hermione guarded with ladies
first lord beseech your highness call the queen again
antigonus be certain what you do sir lest your justice
 prove violence in the which three great ones suffer
 yourself your queen your son
first lord for her my lord
 i dare my life lay down and will do't sir
 please you to accept it that the queen is spotless
 i the eyes of heaven and to you i mean
 in this which you accuse her
antigonus if it prove
 she's otherwise i'll keep my stables where
 i lodge my wife i'll go in couples with her
 than when i feel and see her no farther trust her
 for every inch of woman in the world
 ay every dram of woman's flesh is false if she be
leontes hold your peaces
first lord good my lord
antigonus it is for you we speak not for ourselves
 you are abused and by some putteron
 that will be damn'd for't would i knew the villain
 i would landdamn him be she honourflaw'd
 i have three daughters the eldest is eleven
 the second and the third nine and some five
 if this prove true they'll pay for't
 by mine honour
 i'll geld em all fourteen they shall not see
 to bring false generations they are coheirs
 and i had rather glib myself than they
 should not produce fair issue
leontes cease no more
 you smell this business with a sense as cold
 as is a dead man's nose but i do see't and feel't
 as you feel doing thus and see withal
 the instruments that feel
antigonus if it be so
 we need no grave to bury honesty
 there's not a grain of it the face to sweeten
 of the whole dungy earth
leontes what lack i credit
first lord i had rather you did lack than i my lord
 upon this ground and more it would content me
 to have her honour true than your suspicion
 be blamed for't how you might
leontes why what need we
 commune with you of this but rather follow
 our forceful instigation our prerogative
 calls not your counsels but our natural goodness
 imparts this which if you or stupefied
 or seeming so in skill cannot or will not
 relish a truth like us inform yourselves
 we need no more of your advice the matter
 the loss the gain the ordering on't is all
