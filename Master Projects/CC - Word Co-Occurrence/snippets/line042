2sm159 and the king said unto him go in peace so he arose and went to hebron
2sm1510 but absalom sent spies throughout all the tribes of israel saying as soon as ye hear the sound of the trumpet then ye shall say absalom reigneth in hebron
2sm1511 and with absalom went two hundred men out of jerusalem that were called and they went in their simplicity and they knew not any thing
2sm1512 and absalom sent for ahithophel the gilonite david's counsellor from his city even from giloh while he offered sacrifices and the conspiracy was strong for the people increased continually with absalom
2sm1513 and there came a messenger to david saying the hearts of the men of israel are after absalom
2sm1514 and david said unto all his servants that were with him at jerusalem arise and let us flee for we shall not else escape from absalom make speed to depart lest he overtake us suddenly and bring evil upon us and smite the city with the edge of the sword
2sm1515 and the king's servants said unto the king behold thy servants are ready to do whatsoever my lord the king shall appoint
2sm1516 and the king went forth and all his household after him and the king left ten women which were concubines to keep the house
2sm1517 and the king went forth and all the people after him and tarried in a place that was far off
2sm1518 and all his servants passed on beside him and all the cherethites and all the pelethites and all the gittites six hundred men which came after him from gath passed on before the king
2sm1519 then said the king to ittai the gittite wherefore goest thou also with us return to thy place and abide with the king for thou art a stranger and also an exile
2sm1520 whereas thou camest but yesterday should i this day make thee go up and down with us seeing i go whither i may return thou and take back thy brethren mercy and truth be with thee
2sm1521 and ittai answered the king and said as the lord liveth and as my lord the king liveth surely in what place my lord the king shall be whether in death or life even there also will thy servant be
2sm1522 and david said to ittai go and pass over and ittai the gittite passed over and all his men and all the little ones that were with him
2sm1523 and all the country wept with a loud voice and all the people passed over the king also himself passed over the brook kidron and all the people passed over toward the way of the wilderness
2sm1524 and lo zadok also and all the levites were with him bearing the ark of the covenant of god and they set down the ark of god and abiathar went up until all the people had done passing out of the city
2sm1525 and the king said unto zadok carry back the ark of god into the city if i shall find favour in the eyes of the lord he will bring me again and shew me both it and his habitation
2sm1526 but if he thus say i have no delight in thee behold here am i let him do to me as seemeth good unto him
2sm1527 the king said also unto zadok the priest art not thou a seer return into the city in peace and your two sons with you ahimaaz thy son and jonathan the son of abiathar
2sm1528 see i will tarry in the plain of the wilderness until there come word from you to certify me
2sm1529 zadok therefore and abiathar carried the ark of god again to jerusalem and they tarried there
2sm1530 and david went up by the ascent of mount olivet and wept as he went up and had his head covered and he went barefoot and all the people that was with him covered every man his head and they went up weeping as they went up
2sm1531 and one told david saying ahithophel is among the conspirators with absalom and david said o lord i pray thee turn the counsel of ahithophel into foolishness
2sm1532 and it came to pass that when david was come to the top of the mount where he worshipped god behold hushai the archite came to meet him with his coat rent and earth upon his head
2sm1533 unto whom david said if thou passest on with me then thou shalt be a burden unto me
2sm1534 but if thou return to the city and say unto absalom i will be thy servant o king as i have been thy father's servant hitherto so will i now also be thy servant then mayest thou for me defeat the counsel of ahithophel
2sm1535 and hast thou not there with thee zadok and abiathar the priests therefore it shall be that what thing soever thou shalt hear out of the king's house thou shalt tell it to zadok and abiathar the priests
2sm1536 behold they have there with them their two sons ahimaaz zadok's son and jonathan abiathar's son and by them ye shall send unto me every thing that ye can hear
2sm1537 so hushai david's friend came into the city and absalom came into jerusalem
2sm161 and when david was a little past the top of the hill behold ziba the servant of mephibosheth met him with a couple of asses saddled and upon them two hundred loaves of bread and an hundred bunches of raisins and an hundred of summer fruits and a bottle of wine
2sm162 and the king said unto ziba what meanest thou by these and ziba said the asses be for the king's household to ride on and the bread and summer fruit for the young men to eat and the wine that such as be faint in the wilderness may drink
2sm163 and the king said and where is thy master's son and ziba said unto the king behold he abideth at jerusalem for he said to day shall the house of israel restore me the kingdom of my father
2sm164 then said the king to ziba behold thine are all that pertained unto mephibosheth and ziba said i humbly beseech thee that i may find grace in thy sight my lord o king
2sm165 and when king david came to bahurim behold thence came out a man of the family of the house of saul whose name was shimei the son of gera he came forth and cursed still as he came
2sm166 and he cast stones at david and at all the servants of king david and all the people and all the mighty men were on his right hand and on his left
2sm167 and thus said shimei when he cursed come out come out thou bloody man and thou man of belial
2sm168 the lord hath returned upon thee all the blood of the house of saul in whose stead thou hast reigned and the lord hath delivered the kingdom into the hand of absalom thy son and behold thou art taken in thy mischief because thou art a bloody man
2sm169 then said abishai the son of zeruiah unto the king why should this dead dog curse my lord the king let me go over i pray thee and take off his head
2sm1610 and the king said what have i to do with you ye sons of zeruiah so let him curse because the lord hath said unto him curse david who shall then say wherefore hast thou done so
2sm1611 and david said to abishai and to all his servants behold my son which came forth of my bowels seeketh my life how much more now may this benjamite do it let him alone and let him curse for the lord hath bidden him
2sm1612 it may be that the lord will look on mine affliction and that the lord will requite me good for his cursing this day
2sm1613 and as david and his men went by the way shimei went along on the hill's side over against him and cursed as he went and threw stones at him and cast dust
2sm1614 and the king and all the people that were with him came weary and refreshed themselves there
2sm1615 and absalom and all the people the men of israel came to jerusalem and ahithophel with him
2sm1616 and it came to pass when hushai the archite david's friend was come unto absalom that hushai said unto absalom god save the king god save the king
2sm1617 and absalom said to hushai is this thy kindness to thy friend why wentest thou not with thy friend
2sm1618 and hushai said unto absalom nay but whom the lord and this people and all the men of israel choose his will i be and with him will i abide
2sm1619 and again whom should i serve should i not serve in the presence of his son as i have served in thy father's presence so will i be in thy presence
2sm1620 then said absalom to ahithophel give counsel among you what we shall do
2sm1621 and ahithophel said unto absalom go in unto thy father's concubines which he hath left to keep the house and all israel shall hear that thou art abhorred of thy father then shall the hands of all that are with thee be strong
2sm1622 so they spread absalom a tent upon the top of the house and absalom went in unto his father's concubines in the sight of all israel
2sm1623 and the counsel of ahithophel which he counselled in those days was as if a man had enquired at the oracle of god so was all the counsel of ahithophel both with david and with absalom
2sm171 moreover ahithophel said unto absalom let me now choose out twelve thousand men and i will arise and pursue after david this night
2sm172 and i will come upon him while he is weary and weak handed and will make him afraid and all the people that are with him shall flee and i will smite the king only
2sm173 and i will bring back all the people unto thee the man whom thou seekest is as if all returned so all the people shall be in peace
2sm174 and the saying pleased absalom well and all the elders of israel
2sm175 then said absalom call now hushai the archite also and let us hear likewise what he saith
2sm176 and when hushai was come to absalom absalom spake unto him saying ahithophel hath spoken after this manner shall we do after his saying if not speak thou
2sm177 and hushai said unto absalom the counsel that ahithophel hath given is not good at this time
2sm178 for said hushai thou knowest thy father and his men that they be mighty men and they be chafed in their minds as a bear robbed of her whelps in the field and thy father is a man of war and will not lodge with the people
2sm179 behold he is hid now in some pit or in some other place and it will come to pass when some of them be overthrown at the first that whosoever heareth it will say there is a slaughter among the people that follow absalom
2sm1710 and he also that is valiant whose heart is as the heart of a lion shall utterly melt for all israel knoweth that thy father is a mighty man and they which be with him are valiant men
2sm1711 therefore i counsel that all israel be generally gathered unto thee from dan even to beersheba as the sand that is by the sea for multitude and that thou go to battle in thine own person
2sm1712 so shall we come upon him in some place where he shall be found and we will light upon him as the dew falleth on the ground and of him and of all the men that are with him there shall not be left so much as one
2sm1713 moreover if he be gotten into a city then shall all israel bring ropes to that city and we will draw it into the river until there be not one small stone found there
2sm1714 and absalom and all the men of israel said the counsel of hushai the archite is better than the counsel of ahithophel for the lord had appointed to defeat the good counsel of ahithophel to the intent that the lord might bring evil upon absalom
2sm1715 then said hushai unto zadok and to abiathar the priests thus and thus did ahithophel counsel absalom and the elders of israel and thus and thus have i counselled
2sm1716 now therefore send quickly and tell david saying lodge not this night in the plains of the wilderness but speedily pass over lest the king be swallowed up and all the people that are with him
2sm1717 now jonathan and ahimaaz stayed by enrogel for they might not be seen to come into the city and a wench went and told them and they went and told king david
2sm1718 nevertheless a lad saw them and told absalom but they went both of them away quickly and came to a man's house in bahurim which had a well in his court whither they went down
2sm1719 and the woman took and spread a covering over the well's mouth and spread ground corn thereon and the thing was not known
2sm1720 and when absalom's servants came to the woman to the house they said where is ahimaaz and jonathan and the woman said unto them they be gone over the brook of water and when they had sought and could not find them they returned to jerusalem
2sm1721 and it came to pass after they were departed that they came up out of the well and went and told king david and said unto david arise and pass quickly over the water for thus hath ahithophel counselled against you
2sm1722 then david arose and all the people that were with him and they passed over jordan by the morning light there lacked not one of them that was not gone over jordan
2sm1723 and when ahithophel saw that his counsel was not followed he saddled his ass and arose and gat him home to his house to his city and put his household in order and hanged himself and died and was buried in the sepulchre of his father
2sm1724 then david came to mahanaim and absalom passed over jordan he and all the men of israel with him
2sm1725 and absalom made amasa captain of the host instead of joab which amasa was a man's son whose name was ithra an israelite that went in to abigail the daughter of nahash sister to zeruiah joab's mother
2sm1726 so israel and absalom pitched in the land of gilead
2sm1727 and it came to pass when david was come to mahanaim that shobi the son of nahash of rabbah of the children of ammon and machir the son of ammiel of lodebar and barzillai the gileadite of rogelim
2sm1728 brought beds and basons and earthen vessels and wheat and barley and flour and parched corn and beans and lentiles and parched pulse
2sm1729 and honey and butter and sheep and cheese of kine for david and for the people that were with him to eat for they said the people is hungry and weary and thirsty in the wilderness
2sm181 and david numbered the people that were with him and set captains of thousands and captains of hundreds over them
2sm182 and david sent forth a third part of the people under the hand of joab and a third part under the hand of abishai the son of zeruiah joab's brother and a third part under the hand of ittai the gittite and the king said unto the people i will surely go forth with you myself also
2sm183 but the people answered thou shalt not go forth for if we flee away they will not care for us neither if half of us die will they care for us but now thou art worth ten thousand of us therefore now it is better that thou succour us out of the city
2sm184 and the king said unto them what seemeth you best i will do and the king stood by the gate side and all the people came out by hundreds and by thousands
2sm185 and the king commanded joab and abishai and ittai saying deal gently for my sake with the young man even with absalom and all the people heard when the king gave all the captains charge concerning absalom
2sm186 so the people went out into the field against israel and the battle was in the wood of ephraim
2sm187 where the people of israel were slain before the servants of david and there was there a great slaughter that day of twenty thousand men
2sm188 for the battle was there scattered over the face of all the country and the wood devoured more people that day than the sword devoured
2sm189 and absalom met the servants of david and absalom rode upon a mule and the mule went under the thick boughs of a great oak and his head caught hold of the oak and he was taken up between the heaven and the earth and the mule that was under him went away
2sm1810 and a certain man saw it and told joab and said behold i saw absalom hanged in an oak
2sm1811 and joab said unto the man that told him and behold thou sawest him and why didst thou not smite him there to the ground and i would have given thee ten shekels of silver and a girdle
2sm1812 and the man said unto joab though i should receive a thousand shekels of silver in mine hand yet would i not put forth mine hand against the king's son for in our hearing the king charged thee and abishai and ittai saying beware that none touch the young man absalom
2sm1813 otherwise i should have wrought falsehood against mine own life for there is no matter hid from the king and thou thyself wouldest have set thyself against me
2sm1814 then said joab i may not tarry thus with thee and he took three darts in his hand and thrust them through the heart of absalom while he was yet alive in the midst of the oak
2sm1815 and ten young men that bare joab's armour compassed about and smote absalom and slew him
2sm1816 and joab blew the trumpet and the people returned from pursuing after israel for joab held back the people
2sm1817 and they took absalom and cast him into a great pit in the wood and laid a very great heap of stones upon him and all israel fled every one to his tent
2sm1818 now absalom in his lifetime had taken and reared up for himself a pillar which is in the king's dale for he said i have no son to keep my name in remembrance and he called the pillar after his own name and it is called unto this day absalom's place
2sm1819 then said ahimaaz the son of zadok let me now run and bear the king tidings how that the lord hath avenged him of his enemies
2sm1820 and joab said unto him thou shalt not bear tidings this day but thou shalt bear tidings another day but this day thou shalt bear no tidings because the king's son is dead
2sm1821 then said joab to cushi go tell the king what thou hast seen and cushi bowed himself unto joab and ran
2sm1822 then said ahimaaz the son of zadok yet again to joab but howsoever let me i pray thee also run after cushi and joab said wherefore wilt thou run my son seeing that thou hast no tidings ready
2sm1823 but howsoever said he let me run and he said unto him run then ahimaaz ran by the way of the plain and overran cushi
2sm1824 and david sat between the two gates and the watchman went up to the roof over the gate unto the wall and lifted up his eyes and looked and behold a man running alone
2sm1825 and the watchman cried and told the king and the king said if he be alone there is tidings in his mouth and he came apace and drew near
2sm1826 and the watchman saw another man running and the watchman called unto the porter and said behold another man running alone and the king said he also bringeth tidings
2sm1827 and the watchman said me thinketh the running of the foremost is like the running of ahimaaz the son of zadok and the king said he is a good man and cometh with good tidings
2sm1828 and ahimaaz called and said unto the king all is well and he fell down to the earth upon his face before the king and said blessed be the lord thy god which hath delivered up the men that lifted up their hand against my lord the king
2sm1829 and the king said is the young man absalom safe and ahimaaz answered when joab sent the king's servant and me thy servant i saw a great tumult but i knew not what it was
2sm1830 and the king said unto him turn aside and stand here and he turned aside and stood still
2sm1831 and behold cushi came and cushi said tidings my lord the king for the lord hath avenged thee this day of all them that rose up against thee
2sm1832 and the king said unto cushi is the young man absalom safe and cushi answered the enemies of my lord the king and all that rise against thee to do thee hurt be as that young man is
2sm1833 and the king was much moved and went up to the chamber over the gate and wept and as he went thus he said o my son absalom my son my son absalom would god i had died for thee o absalom my son my son
2sm191 and it was told joab behold the king weepeth and mourneth for absalom
2sm192 and the victory that day was turned into mourning unto all the people for the people heard say that day how the king was grieved for his son
2sm193 and the people gat them by stealth that day into the city as people being ashamed steal away when they flee in battle
2sm194 but the king covered his face and the king cried with a loud voice o my son absalom o absalom my son my son
2sm195 and joab came into the house to the king and said thou hast shamed this day the faces of all thy servants which this day have saved thy life and the lives of thy sons and of thy daughters and the lives of thy wives and the lives of thy concubines
2sm196 in that thou lovest thine enemies and hatest thy friends for thou hast declared this day that thou regardest neither princes nor servants for this day i perceive that if absalom had lived and all we had died this day then it had pleased thee well
2sm197 now therefore arise go forth and speak comfortably unto thy servants for i swear by the lord if thou go not forth there will not tarry one with thee this night and that will be worse unto thee than all the evil that befell thee from thy youth until now
2sm198 then the king arose and sat in the gate and they told unto all the people saying behold the king doth sit in the gate and all the people came before the king for israel had fled every man to his tent
2sm199 and all the people were at strife throughout all the tribes of israel saying the king saved us out of the hand of our enemies and he delivered us out of the hand of the philistines and now he is fled out of the land for absalom
2sm1910 and absalom whom we anointed over us is dead in battle now therefore why speak ye not a word of bringing the king back
2sm1911 and king david sent to zadok and to abiathar the priests saying speak unto the elders of judah saying why are ye the last to bring the king back to his house seeing the speech of all israel is come to the king even to his house
2sm1912 ye are my brethren ye are my bones and my flesh wherefore then are ye the last to bring back the king
2sm1913 and say ye to amasa art thou not of my bone and of my flesh god do so to me and more also if thou be not captain of the host before me continually in the room of joab
2sm1914 and he bowed the heart of all the men of judah even as the heart of one man so that they sent this word unto the king return thou and all thy servants
2sm1915 so the king returned and came to jordan and judah came to gilgal to go to meet the king to conduct the king over jordan
2sm1916 and shimei the son of gera a benjamite which was of bahurim hasted and came down with the men of judah to meet king david
2sm1917 and there were a thousand men of benjamin with him and ziba the servant of the house of saul and his fifteen sons and his twenty servants with him and they went over jordan before the king
2sm1918 and there went over a ferry boat to carry over the king's household and to do what he thought good and shimei the son of gera fell down before the king as he was come over jordan
2sm1919 and said unto the king let not my lord impute iniquity unto me neither do thou remember that which thy servant did perversely the day that my lord the king went out of jerusalem that the king should take it to his heart
2sm1920 for thy servant doth know that i have sinned therefore behold i am come the first this day of all the house of joseph to go down to meet my lord the king
2sm1921 but abishai the son of zeruiah answered and said shall not shimei be put to death for this because he cursed the lord's anointed
2sm1922 and david said what have i to do with you ye sons of zeruiah that ye should this day be adversaries unto me shall there any man be put to death this day in israel for do not i know that i am this day king over israel
2sm1923 therefore the king said unto shimei thou shalt not die and the king sware unto him
2sm1924 and mephibosheth the son of saul came down to meet the king and had neither dressed his feet nor trimmed his beard nor washed his clothes from the day the king departed until the day he came again in peace
2sm1925 and it came to pass when he was come to jerusalem to meet the king that the king said unto him wherefore wentest not thou with me mephibosheth
2sm1926 and he answered my lord o king my servant deceived me for thy servant said i will saddle me an ass that i may ride thereon and go to the king because thy servant is lame
2sm1927 and he hath slandered thy servant unto my lord the king but my lord the king is as an angel of god do therefore what is good in thine eyes
2sm1928 for all of my father's house were but dead men before my lord the king yet didst thou set thy servant among them that did eat at thine own table what right therefore have i yet to cry any more unto the king
2sm1929 and the king said unto him why speakest thou any more of thy matters i have said thou and ziba divide the land
2sm1930 and mephibosheth said unto the king yea let him take all forasmuch as my lord the king is come again in peace unto his own house
2sm1931 and barzillai the gileadite came down from rogelim and went over jordan with the king to conduct him over jordan
2sm1932 now barzillai was a very aged man even fourscore years old and he had provided the king of sustenance while he lay at mahanaim for he was a very great man
2sm1933 and the king said unto barzillai come thou over with me and i will feed thee with me in jerusalem
2sm1934 and barzillai said unto the king how long have i to live that i should go up with the king unto jerusalem
2sm1935 i am this day fourscore years old and can i discern between good and evil can thy servant taste what i eat or what i drink can i hear any more the voice of singing men and singing women wherefore then should thy servant be yet a burden unto my lord the king
2sm1936 thy servant will go a little way over jordan with the king and why should the king recompense it me with such a reward
2sm1937 let thy servant i pray thee turn back again that i may die in mine own city and be buried by the grave of my father and of my mother but behold thy servant chimham let him go over with my lord the king and do to him what shall seem good unto thee
2sm1938 and the king answered chimham shall go over with me and i will do to him that which shall seem good unto thee and whatsoever thou shalt require of me that will i do for thee
2sm1939 and all the people went over jordan and when the king was come over the king kissed barzillai and blessed him and he returned unto his own place
2sm1940 then the king went on to gilgal and chimham went on with him and all the people of judah conducted the king and also half the people of israel
2sm1941 and behold all the men of israel came to the king and said unto the king why have our brethren the men of judah stolen thee away and have brought the king and his household and all david's men with him over jordan
2sm1942 and all the men of judah answered the men of israel because the king is near of kin to us wherefore then be ye angry for this matter have we eaten at all of the king's cost or hath he given us any gift
2sm1943 and the men of israel answered the men of judah and said we have ten parts in the king and we have also more right in david than ye why then did ye despise us that our advice should not be first had in bringing back our king and the words of the men of judah were fiercer than the words of the men of israel
2sm201 and there happened to be there a man of belial whose name was sheba the son of bichri a benjamite and he blew a trumpet and said we have no part in david neither have we inheritance in the son of jesse every man to his tents o israel
2sm202 so every man of israel went up from after david and followed sheba the son of bichri but the men of judah clave unto their king from jordan even to jerusalem
2sm203 and david came to his house at jerusalem and the king took the ten women his concubines whom he had left to keep the house and put them in ward and fed them but went not in unto them so they were shut up unto the day of their death living in widowhood
2sm204 then said the king to amasa assemble me the men of judah within three days and be thou here present
2sm205 so amasa went to assemble the men of judah but he tarried longer than the set time which he had appointed him
2sm206 and david said to abishai now shall sheba the son of bichri do us more harm than did absalom take thou thy lord's servants and pursue after him lest he get him fenced cities and escape us
2sm207 and there went out after him joab's men and the cherethites and the pelethites and all the mighty men and they went out of jerusalem to pursue after sheba the son of bichri
2sm208 when they were at the great stone which is in gibeon amasa went before them and joab's garment that he had put on was girded unto him and upon it a girdle with a sword fastened upon his loins in the sheath thereof and as he went forth it fell out
2sm209 and joab said to amasa art thou in health my brother and joab took amasa by the beard with the right hand to kiss him
2sm2010 but amasa took no heed to the sword that was in joab's hand so he smote him therewith in the fifth rib and shed out his bowels to the ground and struck him not again and he died so joab and abishai his brother pursued after sheba the son of bichri
2sm2011 and one of joab's men stood by him and said he that favoureth joab and he that is for david let him go after joab
2sm2012 and amasa wallowed in blood in the midst of the highway and when the man saw that all the people stood still he removed amasa out of the highway into the field and cast a cloth upon him when he saw that every one that came by him stood still
2sm2013 when he was removed out of the highway all the people went on after joab to pursue after sheba the son of bichri
2sm2014 and he went through all the tribes of israel unto abel and to bethmaachah and all the berites and they were gathered together and went also after him
2sm2015 and they came and besieged him in abel of bethmaachah and they cast up a bank against the city and it stood in the trench and all the people that were with joab battered the wall to throw it down
2sm2016 then cried a wise woman out of the city hear hear say i pray you unto joab come near hither that i may speak with thee
2sm2017 and when he was come near unto her the woman said art thou joab and he answered i am he then she said unto him hear the words of thine handmaid and he answered i do hear
2sm2018 then she spake saying they were wont to speak in old time saying they shall surely ask counsel at abel and so they ended the matter
2sm2019 i am one of them that are peaceable and faithful in israel thou seekest to destroy a city and a mother in israel why wilt thou swallow up the inheritance of the lord
2sm2020 and joab answered and said far be it far be it from me that i should swallow up or destroy
2sm2021 the matter is not so but a man of mount ephraim sheba the son of bichri by name hath lifted up his hand against the king even against david deliver him only and i will depart from the city and the woman said unto joab behold his head shall be thrown to thee over the wall
2sm2022 then the woman went unto all the people in her wisdom and they cut off the head of sheba the son of bichri and cast it out to joab and he blew a trumpet and they retired from the city every man to his tent and joab returned to jerusalem unto the king
2sm2023 now joab was over all the host of israel and benaiah the son of jehoiada was over the cherethites and over the pelethites
2sm2024 and adoram was over the tribute and jehoshaphat the son of ahilud was recorder
2sm2025 and sheva was scribe and zadok and abiathar were the priests
2sm2026 and ira also the jairite was a chief ruler about david
2sm211 then there was a famine in the days of david three years year after year and david enquired of the lord and the lord answered it is for saul and for his bloody house because he slew the gibeonites
2sm212 and the king called the gibeonites and said unto them now the gibeonites were not of the children of israel but of the remnant of the amorites and the children of israel had sworn unto them and saul sought to slay them in his zeal to the children of israel and judah
2sm213 wherefore david said unto the gibeonites what shall i do for you and wherewith shall i make the atonement that ye may bless the inheritance of the lord
2sm214 and the gibeonites said unto him we will have no silver nor gold of saul nor of his house neither for us shalt thou kill any man in israel and he said what ye shall say that will i do for you
2sm215 and they answered the king the man that consumed us and that devised against us that we should be destroyed from remaining in any of the coasts of israel
2sm216 let seven men of his sons be delivered unto us and we will hang them up unto the lord in gibeah of saul whom the lord did choose and the king said i will give them
2sm217 but the king spared mephibosheth the son of jonathan the son of saul because of the lord's oath that was between them between david and jonathan the son of saul
2sm218 but the king took the two sons of rizpah the daughter of aiah whom she bare unto saul armoni and mephibosheth and the five sons of michal the daughter of saul whom she brought up for adriel the son of barzillai the meholathite
2sm219 and he delivered them into the hands of the gibeonites and they hanged them in the hill before the lord and they fell all seven together and were put to death in the days of harvest in the first days in the beginning of barley harvest
2sm2110 and rizpah the daughter of aiah took sackcloth and spread it for her upon the rock from the beginning of harvest until water dropped upon them out of heaven and suffered neither the birds of the air to rest on them by day nor the beasts of the field by night
2sm2111 and it was told david what rizpah the daughter of aiah the concubine of saul had done
2sm2112 and david went and took the bones of saul and the bones of jonathan his son from the men of jabeshgilead which had stolen them from the street of bethshan where the philistines had hanged them when the philistines had slain saul in gilboa
2sm2113 and he brought up from thence the bones of saul and the bones of jonathan his son and they gathered the bones of them that were hanged
2sm2114 and the bones of saul and jonathan his son buried they in the country of benjamin in zelah in the sepulchre of kish his father and they performed all that the king commanded and after that god was intreated for the land
2sm2115 moreover the philistines had yet war again with israel and david went down and his servants with him and fought against the philistines and david waxed faint
2sm2116 and ishbibenob which was of the sons of the giant the weight of whose spear weighed three hundred shekels of brass in weight he being girded with a new sword thought to have slain david
2sm2117 but abishai the son of zeruiah succoured him and smote the philistine and killed him then the men of david sware unto him saying thou shalt go no more out with us to battle that thou quench not the light of israel
