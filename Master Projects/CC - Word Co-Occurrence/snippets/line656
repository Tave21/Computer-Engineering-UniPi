 of valour do you think me a swallow an arrow or a
 bullet have i in my poor and old motion the
 expedition of thought i have speeded hither with
 the very extremest inch of possibility i have
 foundered nine score and odd posts and here
 traveltainted as i am have in my pure and
 immaculate valour taken sir john colevile of the
 dale a most furious knight and valorous enemy
 but what of that he saw me and yielded that i
 may justly say with the hooknosed fellow of rome
 i came saw and overcame'
lancaster it was more of his courtesy than your deserving
falstaff i know not here he is and here i yield him and
 i beseech your grace let it be booked with the
 rest of this day's deeds or by the lord i will
 have it in a particular ballad else with mine own
 picture on the top on't colevile kissing my foot
 to the which course if i be enforced if you do not
 all show like gilt twopences to me and i in the
 clear sky of fame o'ershine you as much as the full
 moon doth the cinders of the element which show
 like pins heads to her believe not the word of
 the noble therefore let me have right and let
 desert mount
lancaster thine's too heavy to mount
falstaff let it shine then
lancaster thine's too thick to shine
falstaff let it do something my good lord that may do me
 good and call it what you will
lancaster is thy name colevile
colevile it is my lord
lancaster a famous rebel art thou colevile
falstaff and a famous true subject took him
colevile i am my lord but as my betters are
 that led me hither had they been ruled by me
 you should have won them dearer than you have
falstaff i know not how they sold themselves but thou like
 a kind fellow gavest thyself away gratis and i
 thank thee for thee
 reenter westmoreland
lancaster now have you left pursuit
westmoreland retreat is made and execution stay'd
lancaster send colevile with his confederates
 to york to present execution
 blunt lead him hence and see you guard him sure
 exeunt blunt and others with colevile
 and now dispatch we toward the court my lords
 i hear the king my father is sore sick
 our news shall go before us to his majesty
 which cousin you shall bear to comfort him
 and we with sober speed will follow you
falstaff my lord i beseech you give me leave to go
 through gloucestershire and when you come to court
 stand my good lord pray in your good report
lancaster fare you well falstaff i in my condition
 shall better speak of you than you deserve
 exeunt all but falstaff
falstaff i would you had but the wit twere better than
 your dukedom good faith this same young sober
 blooded boy doth not love me nor a man cannot make
 him laugh but that's no marvel he drinks no wine
 there's never none of these demure boys come to any
 proof for thin drink doth so overcool their blood
 and making many fishmeals that they fall into a
 kind of male greensickness and then when they
 marry they get wenches they are generally fools
 and cowards which some of us should be too but for
 inflammation a good sherris sack hath a twofold
 operation in it it ascends me into the brain
 dries me there all the foolish and dull and curdy
 vapours which environ it makes it apprehensive
 quick forgetive full of nimble fiery and
 delectable shapes which delivered o'er to the
 voice the tongue which is the birth becomes
 excellent wit the second property of your
 excellent sherris is the warming of the blood
 which before cold and settled left the liver
 white and pale which is the badge of pusillanimity
 and cowardice but the sherris warms it and makes
 it course from the inwards to the parts extreme
 it illumineth the face which as a beacon gives
 warning to all the rest of this little kingdom
 man to arm and then the vital commoners and
 inland petty spirits muster me all to their captain
 the heart who great and puffed up with this
 retinue doth any deed of courage and this valour
 comes of sherris so that skill in the weapon is
 nothing without sack for that sets it awork and
 learning a mere hoard of gold kept by a devil till
 sack commences it and sets it in act and use
 hereof comes it that prince harry is valiant for
 the cold blood he did naturally inherit of his
 father he hath like lean sterile and bare land
 manured husbanded and tilled with excellent
 endeavour of drinking good and good store of fertile
 sherris that he is become very hot and valiant if
 i had a thousand sons the first humane principle i
 would teach them should be to forswear thin
 potations and to addict themselves to sack
 enter bardolph
 how now bardolph
bardolph the army is discharged all and gone
falstaff let them go i'll through gloucestershire and
 there will i visit master robert shallow esquire
 i have him already tempering between my finger and
 my thumb and shortly will i seal with him come away
 exeunt
 2 king henry iv
act iv
scene iv westminster the jerusalem chamber
 enter king henry iv the princes thomas of clarence
 and humphrey of gloucester warwick and others
king henry iv now lords if god doth give successful end
 to this debate that bleedeth at our doors
 we will our youth lead on to higher fields
 and draw no swords but what are sanctified
 our navy is address'd our power collected
 our substitutes in absence well invested
 and every thing lies level to our wish
 only we want a little personal strength
 and pause us till these rebels now afoot
 come underneath the yoke of government
warwick both which we doubt not but your majesty
 shall soon enjoy
king henry iv humphrey my son of gloucester
 where is the prince your brother
gloucester i think he's gone to hunt my lord at windsor
king henry iv and how accompanied
gloucester i do not know my lord
king henry iv is not his brother thomas of clarence with him
gloucester no my good lord he is in presence here
clarence what would my lord and father
king henry iv nothing but well to thee thomas of clarence
 how chance thou art not with the prince thy brother
 he loves thee and thou dost neglect him thomas
 thou hast a better place in his affection
 than all thy brothers cherish it my boy
 and noble offices thou mayst effect
 of mediation after i am dead
 between his greatness and thy other brethren
 therefore omit him not blunt not his love
 nor lose the good advantage of his grace
 by seeming cold or careless of his will
 for he is gracious if he be observed
 he hath a tear for pity and a hand
 open as day for melting charity
 yet notwithstanding being incensed he's flint
 as humorous as winter and as sudden
 as flaws congealed in the spring of day
 his temper therefore must be well observed
 chide him for faults and do it reverently
 when thou perceive his blood inclined to mirth
 but being moody give him line and scope
 till that his passions like a whale on ground
 confound themselves with working learn this thomas
 and thou shalt prove a shelter to thy friends
 a hoop of gold to bind thy brothers in
 that the united vessel of their blood
 mingled with venom of suggestion
 as force perforce the age will pour it in
 shall never leak though it do work as strong
 as aconitum or rash gunpowder
clarence i shall observe him with all care and love
king henry iv why art thou not at windsor with him thomas
clarence he is not there today he dines in london
king henry iv and how accompanied canst thou tell that
clarence with poins and other his continual followers
king henry iv most subject is the fattest soil to weeds
 and he the noble image of my youth
 is overspread with them therefore my grief
 stretches itself beyond the hour of death
 the blood weeps from my heart when i do shape
 in forms imaginary the unguided days
 and rotten times that you shall look upon
 when i am sleeping with my ancestors
 for when his headstrong riot hath no curb
 when rage and hot blood are his counsellors
 when means and lavish manners meet together
 o with what wings shall his affections fly
 towards fronting peril and opposed decay
warwick my gracious lord you look beyond him quite
 the prince but studies his companions
 like a strange tongue wherein to gain the language
 tis needful that the most immodest word
 be look'd upon and learn'd which once attain'd
 your highness knows comes to no further use
 but to be known and hated so like gross terms
 the prince will in the perfectness of time
 cast off his followers and their memory
 shall as a pattern or a measure live
 by which his grace must mete the lives of others
 turning past evils to advantages
king henry iv tis seldom when the bee doth leave her comb
 in the dead carrion
 enter westmoreland
 who's here westmoreland
westmoreland health to my sovereign and new happiness
 added to that that i am to deliver
 prince john your son doth kiss your grace's hand
 mowbray the bishop scroop hastings and all
