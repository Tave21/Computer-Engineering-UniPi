 i will come last tis like he'll question me
 why such unplausive eyes are bent on him
 if so i have derision medicinable
 to use between your strangeness and his pride
 which his own will shall have desire to drink
 it may be good pride hath no other glass
 to show itself but pride for supple knees
 feed arrogance and are the proud man's fees
agamemnon we'll execute your purpose and put on
 a form of strangeness as we pass along
 so do each lord and either greet him not
 or else disdainfully which shall shake him more
 than if not look'd on i will lead the way
achilles what comes the general to speak with me
 you know my mind i'll fight no more gainst troy
agamemnon what says achilles would he aught with us
nestor would you my lord aught with the general
achilles no
nestor nothing my lord
agamemnon the better
 exeunt agamemnon and nestor
achilles good day good day
menelaus how do you how do you
 exit
achilles what does the cuckold scorn me
ajax how now patroclus
achilles good morrow ajax
ajax ha
achilles good morrow
ajax ay and good next day too
 exit
achilles what mean these fellows know they not achilles
patroclus they pass by strangely they were used to bend
 to send their smiles before them to achilles
 to come as humbly as they used to creep
 to holy altars
achilles what am i poor of late
 tis certain greatness once fall'n out with fortune
 must fall out with men too what the declined is
 he shall as soon read in the eyes of others
 as feel in his own fall for men like butterflies
 show not their mealy wings but to the summer
 and not a man for being simply man
 hath any honour but honour for those honours
 that are without him as place riches favour
 prizes of accident as oft as merit
 which when they fall as being slippery standers
 the love that lean'd on them as slippery too
 do one pluck down another and together
 die in the fall but tis not so with me
 fortune and i are friends i do enjoy
 at ample point all that i did possess
 save these men's looks who do methinks find out
 something not worth in me such rich beholding
 as they have often given here is ulysses
 i'll interrupt his reading
 how now ulysses
ulysses now great thetis son
achilles what are you reading
ulysses a strange fellow here
 writes me that man how dearly ever parted
 how much in having or without or in
 cannot make boast to have that which he hath
 nor feels not what he owes but by reflection
 as when his virtues shining upon others
 heat them and they retort that heat again
 to the first giver'
achilles this is not strange ulysses
 the beauty that is borne here in the face
 the bearer knows not but commends itself
 to others eyes nor doth the eye itself
 that most pure spirit of sense behold itself
 not going from itself but eye to eye opposed
 salutes each other with each other's form
 for speculation turns not to itself
 till it hath travell'd and is mirror'd there
 where it may see itself this is not strange at all
ulysses i do not strain at the position
 it is familiarbut at the author's drift
 who in his circumstance expressly proves
 that no man is the lord of any thing
 though in and of him there be much consisting
 till he communicate his parts to others
 nor doth he of himself know them for aught
 till he behold them form'd in the applause
 where they're extended who like an arch
 reverberates
 the voice again or like a gate of steel
 fronting the sun receives and renders back
 his figure and his heat i was much wrapt in this
 and apprehended here immediately
 the unknown ajax
 heavens what a man is there a very horse
 that has he knows not what nature what things there are
 most abject in regard and dear in use
 what things again most dear in the esteem
 and poor in worth now shall we see tomorrow
 an act that very chance doth throw upon him
 ajax renown'd o heavens what some men do
 while some men leave to do
 how some men creep in skittish fortune's hall
 whiles others play the idiots in her eyes
 how one man eats into another's pride
 while pride is fasting in his wantonness
 to see these grecian lordswhy even already
 they clap the lubber ajax on the shoulder
 as if his foot were on brave hector's breast
 and great troy shrieking
achilles i do believe it for they pass'd by me
 as misers do by beggars neither gave to me
 good word nor look what are my deeds forgot
ulysses time hath my lord a wallet at his back
 wherein he puts alms for oblivion
 a greatsized monster of ingratitudes
 those scraps are good deeds past which are devour'd
 as fast as they are made forgot as soon
 as done perseverance dear my lord
 keeps honour bright to have done is to hang
 quite out of fashion like a rusty mail
 in monumental mockery take the instant way
 for honour travels in a strait so narrow
 where one but goes abreast keep then the path
 for emulation hath a thousand sons
 that one by one pursue if you give way
 or hedge aside from the direct forthright
 like to an enter'd tide they all rush by
 and leave you hindmost
 or like a gallant horse fall'n in first rank
 lie there for pavement to the abject rear
 o'errun and trampled on then what they do in present
 though less than yours in past must o'ertop yours
 for time is like a fashionable host
 that slightly shakes his parting guest by the hand
 and with his arms outstretch'd as he would fly
 grasps in the comer welcome ever smiles
 and farewell goes out sighing o let not
 virtue seek
 remuneration for the thing it was
 for beauty wit
 high birth vigour of bone desert in service
 love friendship charity are subjects all
 to envious and calumniating time
 one touch of nature makes the whole world kin
 that all with one consent praise newborn gawds
 though they are made and moulded of things past
 and give to dust that is a little gilt
 more laud than gilt o'erdusted
 the present eye praises the present object
 then marvel not thou great and complete man
 that all the greeks begin to worship ajax
 since things in motion sooner catch the eye
 than what not stirs the cry went once on thee
 and still it might and yet it may again
 if thou wouldst not entomb thyself alive
 and case thy reputation in thy tent
 whose glorious deeds but in these fields of late
 made emulous missions mongst the gods themselves
 and drave great mars to faction
achilles of this my privacy
 i have strong reasons
ulysses but gainst your privacy
 the reasons are more potent and heroical
 tis known achilles that you are in love
 with one of priam's daughters
achilles ha known
ulysses is that a wonder
 the providence that's in a watchful state
 knows almost every grain of plutus gold
 finds bottom in the uncomprehensive deeps
 keeps place with thought and almost like the gods
 does thoughts unveil in their dumb cradles
 there is a mysterywith whom relation
 durst never meddlein the soul of state
 which hath an operation more divine
 than breath or pen can give expressure to
 all the commerce that you have had with troy
 as perfectly is ours as yours my lord
 and better would it fit achilles much
 to throw down hector than polyxena
 but it must grieve young pyrrhus now at home
 when fame shall in our islands sound her trump
 and all the greekish girls shall tripping sing
 great hector's sister did achilles win
 but our great ajax bravely beat down him'
 farewell my lord i as your lover speak
 the fool slides o'er the ice that you should break
 exit
patroclus to this effect achilles have i moved you
 a woman impudent and mannish grown
 is not more loathed than an effeminate man
 in time of action i stand condemn'd for this
 they think my little stomach to the war
 and your great love to me restrains you thus
 sweet rouse yourself and the weak wanton cupid
 shall from your neck unloose his amorous fold
 and like a dewdrop from the lion's mane
 be shook to air
achilles shall ajax fight with hector
patroclus ay and perhaps receive much honour by him
achilles i see my reputation is at stake
