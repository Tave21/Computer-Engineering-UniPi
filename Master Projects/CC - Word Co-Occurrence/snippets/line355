as it fell upon a day
in the merry month of may
sitting in a pleasant shade
which a grove of myrtles made
beasts did leap and birds did sing
trees did grow and plants did spring
every thing did banish moan
save the nightingale alone
she poor bird as all forlorn
lean'd her breast uptill a thorn
and there sung the dolefull'st ditty
that to hear it was great pity
'fie fie fie now would she cry
'tereu tereu by and by
that to hear her so complain
scarce i could from tears refrain
for her griefs so lively shown
made me think upon mine own
ah thought i thou mourn'st in vain
none takes pity on thy pain
senseless trees they cannot hear thee
ruthless beasts they will not cheer thee
king pandion he is dead
all thy friends are lapp'd in lead
all thy fellow birds do sing
careless of thy sorrowing
even so poor bird like thee
none alive will pity me
whilst as fickle fortune smiled
thou and i were both beguiled
every one that flatters thee
is no friend in misery
words are easy like the wind
faithful friends are hard to find
every man will be thy friend
whilst thou hast wherewith to spend
but if store of crowns be scant
no man will supply thy want
if that one be prodigal
bountiful they will him call
and with suchlike flattering
'pity but he were a king'
if he be addict to vice
quickly him they will entice
if to women he be bent
they have at commandement
but if fortune once do frown
then farewell his great renown
they that fawn'd on him before
use his company no more
he that is thy friend indeed
he will help thee in thy need
if thou sorrow he will weep
if thou wake he cannot sleep
thus of every grief in heart
he with thee doth bear a part
these are certain signs to know
faithful friend from flattering foe
 the phoenix and the turtle
 let the bird of loudest lay
 on the sole arabian tree
 herald sad and trumpet be
 to whose sound chaste wings obey
 but thou shrieking harbinger
 foul precurrer of the fiend
 augur of the fever's end
 to this troop come thou not near
 from this session interdict
 every fowl of tyrant wing
 save the eagle feather'd king
 keep the obsequy so strict
 let the priest in surplice white
 that defunctive music can
 be the deathdivining swan
 lest the requiem lack his right
 and thou trebledated crow
 that thy sable gender makest
 with the breath thou givest and takest
 mongst our mourners shalt thou go
 here the anthem doth commence
 love and constancy is dead
 phoenix and the turtle fled
 in a mutual flame from hence
 so they loved as love in twain
 had the essence but in one
 two distincts division none
 number there in love was slain
 hearts remote yet not asunder
 distance and no space was seen
 twixt the turtle and his queen
 but in them it were a wonder
 so between them love did shine
 that the turtle saw his right
 flaming in the phoenix sight
 either was the other's mine
 property was thus appalled
 that the self was not the same
 single nature's double name
 neither two nor one was called
 reason in itself confounded
 saw division grow together
 to themselves yet either neither
 simple were so well compounded
 that it cried how true a twain
 seemeth this concordant one
 love hath reason reason none
 if what parts can so remain
 whereupon it made this threne
 to the phoenix and the dove
 cosupremes and stars of love
 as chorus to their tragic scene
 threnos
 beauty truth and rarity
 grace in all simplicity
 here enclosed in cinders lie
 death is now the phoenix nest
 and the turtle's loyal breast
 to eternity doth rest
 leaving no posterity
 twas not their infirmity
 it was married chastity
 truth may seem but cannot be
 beauty brag but tis not she
 truth and beauty buried be
 to this urn let those repair
 that are either true or fair
 for these dead birds sigh a prayer

to the
right honorable henry wriothesly
earl of southampton and baron of tichfield
right honorable
i know not how i shall offend in dedicating my
unpolished lines to your lordship nor how the world will
censure me for choosing so strong a prop to support so weak a
burden only if your honour seem but pleased i account
myself highly praised and vow to take advantage of all idle
hours till i have honoured you with some graver labour but if
the first heir of my invention prove deformed i shall be
sorry it had so noble a godfather and never after ear so
barren a land for fear it yield me still so bad a harvest
i leave it to your honourable survey and your honour to your
heart's content which i wish may always answer your own wish
and the world's hopeful expectation
your honour's in all duty
william shakespeare
even as the sun with purplecolour'd face
had ta'en his last leave of the weeping morn
rosecheek'd adonis hied him to the chase
hunting he loved but love he laugh'd to scorn
sickthoughted venus makes amain unto him
and like a boldfaced suitor gins to woo him
'thricefairer than myself thus she began
'the field's chief flower sweet above compare
stain to all nymphs more lovely than a man
more white and red than doves or roses are
nature that made thee with herself at strife
saith that the world hath ending with thy life
'vouchsafe thou wonder to alight thy steed
and rein his proud head to the saddlebow
if thou wilt deign this favour for thy meed
a thousand honey secrets shalt thou know
here come and sit where never serpent hisses
and being set i'll smother thee with kisses
'and yet not cloy thy lips with loathed satiety
but rather famish them amid their plenty
making them red and pale with fresh variety
ten kisses short as one one long as twenty
a summer's day will seem an hour but short
being wasted in such timebeguiling sport'
with this she seizeth on his sweating palm
the precedent of pith and livelihood
and trembling in her passion calls it balm
earth's sovereign salve to do a goddess good
being so enraged desire doth lend her force
courageously to pluck him from his horse
over one arm the lusty courser's rein
under her other was the tender boy
who blush'd and pouted in a dull disdain
with leaden appetite unapt to toy
she red and hot as coals of glowing fire
he red for shame but frosty in desire
the studded bridle on a ragged bough
nimbly she fastenso how quick is love
the steed is stalled up and even now
to tie the rider she begins to prove
backward she push'd him as she would be thrust
and govern'd him in strength though not in lust
so soon was she along as he was down
each leaning on their elbows and their hips
now doth she stroke his cheek now doth he frown
and gins to chide but soon she stops his lips
and kissing speaks with lustful language broken
'if thou wilt chide thy lips shall never open'
he burns with bashful shame she with her tears
doth quench the maiden burning of his cheeks
then with her windy sighs and golden hairs
to fan and blow them dry again she seeks
