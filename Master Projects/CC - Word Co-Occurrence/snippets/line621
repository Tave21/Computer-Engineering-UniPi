 1 king henry iv
act iii
scene ii london the palace
 enter king henry iv prince henry and others
king henry iv lords give us leave the prince of wales and i
 must have some private conference but be near at hand
 for we shall presently have need of you
 exeunt lords
 i know not whether god will have it so
 for some displeasing service i have done
 that in his secret doom out of my blood
 he'll breed revengement and a scourge for me
 but thou dost in thy passages of life
 make me believe that thou art only mark'd
 for the hot vengeance and the rod of heaven
 to punish my mistreadings tell me else
 could such inordinate and low desires
 such poor such bare such lewd such mean attempts
 such barren pleasures rude society
 as thou art match'd withal and grafted to
 accompany the greatness of thy blood
 and hold their level with thy princely heart
prince henry so please your majesty i would i could
 quit all offences with as clear excuse
 as well as i am doubtless i can purge
 myself of many i am charged withal
 yet such extenuation let me beg
 as in reproof of many tales devised
 which oft the ear of greatness needs must hear
 by smiling pickthanks and base newsmongers
 i may for some things true wherein my youth
 hath faulty wander'd and irregular
 find pardon on my true submission
king henry iv god pardon thee yet let me wonder harry
 at thy affections which do hold a wing
 quite from the flight of all thy ancestors
 thy place in council thou hast rudely lost
 which by thy younger brother is supplied
 and art almost an alien to the hearts
 of all the court and princes of my blood
 the hope and expectation of thy time
 is ruin'd and the soul of every man
 prophetically doth forethink thy fall
 had i so lavish of my presence been
 so commonhackney'd in the eyes of men
 so stale and cheap to vulgar company
 opinion that did help me to the crown
 had still kept loyal to possession
 and left me in reputeless banishment
 a fellow of no mark nor likelihood
 by being seldom seen i could not stir
 but like a comet i was wonder'd at
 that men would tell their children this is he'
 others would say where which is bolingbroke'
 and then i stole all courtesy from heaven
 and dress'd myself in such humility
 that i did pluck allegiance from men's hearts
 loud shouts and salutations from their mouths
 even in the presence of the crowned king
 thus did i keep my person fresh and new
 my presence like a robe pontifical
 ne'er seen but wonder'd at and so my state
 seldom but sumptuous showed like a feast
 and won by rareness such solemnity
 the skipping king he ambled up and down
 with shallow jesters and rash bavin wits
 soon kindled and soon burnt carded his state
 mingled his royalty with capering fools
 had his great name profaned with their scorns
 and gave his countenance against his name
 to laugh at gibing boys and stand the push
 of every beardless vain comparative
 grew a companion to the common streets
 enfeoff'd himself to popularity
 that being daily swallow'd by men's eyes
 they surfeited with honey and began
 to loathe the taste of sweetness whereof a little
 more than a little is by much too much
 so when he had occasion to be seen
 he was but as the cuckoo is in june
 heard not regarded seen but with such eyes
 as sick and blunted with community
 afford no extraordinary gaze
 such as is bent on sunlike majesty
 when it shines seldom in admiring eyes
 but rather drowzed and hung their eyelids down
 slept in his face and render'd such aspect
 as cloudy men use to their adversaries
 being with his presence glutted gorged and full
 and in that very line harry standest thou
 for thou has lost thy princely privilege
 with vile participation not an eye
 but is aweary of thy common sight
 save mine which hath desired to see thee more
 which now doth that i would not have it do
 make blind itself with foolish tenderness
prince henry i shall hereafter my thrice gracious lord
 be more myself
king henry iv for all the world
 as thou art to this hour was richard then
 when i from france set foot at ravenspurgh
 and even as i was then is percy now
 now by my sceptre and my soul to boot
 he hath more worthy interest to the state
 than thou the shadow of succession
 for of no right nor colour like to right
 he doth fill fields with harness in the realm
 turns head against the lion's armed jaws
 and being no more in debt to years than thou
 leads ancient lords and reverend bishops on
 to bloody battles and to bruising arms
 what neverdying honour hath he got
 against renowned douglas whose high deeds
 whose hot incursions and great name in arms
 holds from all soldiers chief majority
 and military title capital
 through all the kingdoms that acknowledge christ
 thrice hath this hotspur mars in swathling clothes
 this infant warrior in his enterprises
 discomfited great douglas ta'en him once
 enlarged him and made a friend of him
 to fill the mouth of deep defiance up
 and shake the peace and safety of our throne
 and what say you to this percy northumberland
 the archbishop's grace of york douglas mortimer
 capitulate against us and are up
 but wherefore do i tell these news to thee
 why harry do i tell thee of my foes
 which art my near'st and dearest enemy
 thou that art like enough through vassal fear
 base inclination and the start of spleen
 to fight against me under percy's pay
 to dog his heels and curtsy at his frowns
 to show how much thou art degenerate
prince henry do not think so you shall not find it so
 and god forgive them that so much have sway'd
 your majesty's good thoughts away from me
 i will redeem all this on percy's head
 and in the closing of some glorious day
 be bold to tell you that i am your son
 when i will wear a garment all of blood
 and stain my favours in a bloody mask
 which wash'd away shall scour my shame with it
 and that shall be the day whene'er it lights
 that this same child of honour and renown
 this gallant hotspur this allpraised knight
 and your unthoughtof harry chance to meet
 for every honour sitting on his helm
 would they were multitudes and on my head
 my shames redoubled for the time will come
 that i shall make this northern youth exchange
 his glorious deeds for my indignities
 percy is but my factor good my lord
 to engross up glorious deeds on my behalf
 and i will call him to so strict account
 that he shall render every glory up
 yea even the slightest worship of his time
 or i will tear the reckoning from his heart
 this in the name of god i promise here
 the which if he be pleased i shall perform
 i do beseech your majesty may salve
 the longgrown wounds of my intemperance
 if not the end of life cancels all bands
 and i will die a hundred thousand deaths
 ere break the smallest parcel of this vow
king henry iv a hundred thousand rebels die in this
 thou shalt have charge and sovereign trust herein
 enter blunt
 how now good blunt thy looks are full of speed
sir walter blunt so hath the business that i come to speak of
 lord mortimer of scotland hath sent word
 that douglas and the english rebels met
 the eleventh of this month at shrewsbury
 a mighty and a fearful head they are
 if promises be kept on every hand
 as ever offer'd foul play in the state
king henry iv the earl of westmoreland set forth today
 with him my son lord john of lancaster
 for this advertisement is five days old
 on wednesday next harry you shall set forward
 on thursday we ourselves will march our meeting
 is bridgenorth and harry you shall march
 through gloucestershire by which account
 our business valued some twelve days hence
 our general forces at bridgenorth shall meet
 our hands are full of business let's away
 advantage feeds him fat while men delay
