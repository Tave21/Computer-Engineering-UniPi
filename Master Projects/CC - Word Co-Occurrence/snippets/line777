 and lead thy daughter to a conqueror's bed
 to whom i will retail my conquest won
 and she shall be sole victress caesar's caesar
queen elizabeth what were i best to say her father's brother
 would be her lord or shall i say her uncle
 or he that slew her brothers and her uncles
 under what title shall i woo for thee
 that god the law my honour and her love
 can make seem pleasing to her tender years
king richard iii infer fair england's peace by this alliance
queen elizabeth which she shall purchase with still lasting war
king richard iii say that the king which may command entreats
queen elizabeth that at her hands which the king's king forbids
king richard iii say she shall be a high and mighty queen
queen elizabeth to wail the tide as her mother doth
king richard iii say i will love her everlastingly
queen elizabeth but how long shall that title ever last
king richard iii sweetly in force unto her fair life's end
queen elizabeth but how long fairly shall her sweet lie last
king richard iii so long as heaven and nature lengthens it
queen elizabeth so long as hell and richard likes of it
king richard iii say i her sovereign am her subject love
queen elizabeth but she your subject loathes such sovereignty
king richard iii be eloquent in my behalf to her
queen elizabeth an honest tale speeds best being plainly told
king richard iii then in plain terms tell her my loving tale
queen elizabeth plain and not honest is too harsh a style
king richard iii your reasons are too shallow and too quick
queen elizabeth o no my reasons are too deep and dead
 too deep and dead poor infants in their grave
king richard iii harp not on that string madam that is past
queen elizabeth harp on it still shall i till heartstrings break
king richard iii now by my george my garter and my crown
queen elizabeth profaned dishonour'd and the third usurp'd
king richard iii i swear
queen elizabeth by nothing for this is no oath
 the george profaned hath lost his holy honour
 the garter blemish'd pawn'd his knightly virtue
 the crown usurp'd disgraced his kingly glory
 if something thou wilt swear to be believed
 swear then by something that thou hast not wrong'd
king richard iii now by the world
queen elizabeth tis full of thy foul wrongs
king richard iii my father's death
queen elizabeth thy life hath that dishonour'd
king richard iii then by myself
queen elizabeth thyself thyself misusest
king richard iii why then by god
queen elizabeth god's wrong is most of all
 if thou hadst fear'd to break an oath by him
 the unity the king thy brother made
 had not been broken nor my brother slain
 if thou hadst fear'd to break an oath by him
 the imperial metal circling now thy brow
 had graced the tender temples of my child
 and both the princes had been breathing here
 which now two tender playfellows to dust
 thy broken faith hath made a prey for worms
 what canst thou swear by now
king richard iii the time to come
queen elizabeth that thou hast wronged in the time o'erpast
 for i myself have many tears to wash
 hereafter time for time past wrong'd by thee
 the children live whose parents thou hast
 slaughter'd
 ungovern'd youth to wail it in their age
 the parents live whose children thou hast butcher'd
 old wither'd plants to wail it with their age
 swear not by time to come for that thou hast
 misused ere used by time misused o'erpast
king richard iii as i intend to prosper and repent
 so thrive i in my dangerous attempt
 of hostile arms myself myself confound
 heaven and fortune bar me happy hours
 day yield me not thy light nor night thy rest
 be opposite all planets of good luck
 to my proceedings if with pure heart's love
 immaculate devotion holy thoughts
 i tender not thy beauteous princely daughter
 in her consists my happiness and thine
 without her follows to this land and me
 to thee herself and many a christian soul
 death desolation ruin and decay
 it cannot be avoided but by this
 it will not be avoided but by this
 therefore good motheri must can you so
 be the attorney of my love to her
 plead what i will be not what i have been
 not my deserts but what i will deserve
 urge the necessity and state of times
 and be not peevishfond in great designs
queen elizabeth shall i be tempted of the devil thus
king richard iii ay if the devil tempt thee to do good
queen elizabeth shall i forget myself to be myself
king richard iii ay if yourself's remembrance wrong yourself
queen elizabeth but thou didst kill my children
king richard iii but in your daughter's womb i bury them
 where in that nest of spicery they shall breed
 selves of themselves to your recomforture
queen elizabeth shall i go win my daughter to thy will
king richard iii and be a happy mother by the deed
queen elizabeth i go write to me very shortly
 and you shall understand from me her mind
king richard iii bear her my true love's kiss and so farewell
