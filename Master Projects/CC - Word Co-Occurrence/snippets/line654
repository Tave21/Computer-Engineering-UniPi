messenger west of this forest scarcely off a mile
 in goodly form comes on the enemy
 and by the ground they hide i judge their number
 upon or near the rate of thirty thousand
mowbray the just proportion that we gave them out
 let us sway on and face them in the field
archbishop of york what wellappointed leader fronts us here
 enter westmoreland
mowbray i think it is my lord of westmoreland
westmoreland health and fair greeting from our general
 the prince lord john and duke of lancaster
archbishop of york say on my lord of westmoreland in peace
 what doth concern your coming
westmoreland then my lord
 unto your grace do i in chief address
 the substance of my speech if that rebellion
 came like itself in base and abject routs
 led on by bloody youth guarded with rags
 and countenanced by boys and beggary
 i say if damn'd commotion so appear'd
 in his true native and most proper shape
 you reverend father and these noble lords
 had not been here to dress the ugly form
 of base and bloody insurrection
 with your fair honours you lord archbishop
 whose see is by a civil peace maintained
 whose beard the silver hand of peace hath touch'd
 whose learning and good letters peace hath tutor'd
 whose white investments figure innocence
 the dove and very blessed spirit of peace
 wherefore do you so ill translate ourself
 out of the speech of peace that bears such grace
 into the harsh and boisterous tongue of war
 turning your books to graves your ink to blood
 your pens to lances and your tongue divine
 to a trumpet and a point of war
archbishop of york wherefore do i this so the question stands
 briefly to this end we are all diseased
 and with our surfeiting and wanton hours
 have brought ourselves into a burning fever
 and we must bleed for it of which disease
 our late king richard being infected died
 but my most noble lord of westmoreland
 i take not on me here as a physician
 nor do i as an enemy to peace
 troop in the throngs of military men
 but rather show awhile like fearful war
 to diet rank minds sick of happiness
 and purge the obstructions which begin to stop
 our very veins of life hear me more plainly
 i have in equal balance justly weigh'd
 what wrongs our arms may do what wrongs we suffer
 and find our griefs heavier than our offences
 we see which way the stream of time doth run
 and are enforced from our most quiet there
 by the rough torrent of occasion
 and have the summary of all our griefs
 when time shall serve to show in articles
 which long ere this we offer'd to the king
 and might by no suit gain our audience
 when we are wrong'd and would unfold our griefs
 we are denied access unto his person
 even by those men that most have done us wrong
 the dangers of the days but newly gone
 whose memory is written on the earth
 with yet appearing blood and the examples
 of every minute's instance present now
 hath put us in these illbeseeming arms
 not to break peace or any branch of it
 but to establish here a peace indeed
 concurring both in name and quality
westmoreland when ever yet was your appeal denied
 wherein have you been galled by the king
 what peer hath been suborn'd to grate on you
 that you should seal this lawless bloody book
 of forged rebellion with a seal divine
 and consecrate commotion's bitter edge
archbishop of york my brother general the commonwealth
 to brother born an household cruelty
 i make my quarrel in particular
westmoreland there is no need of any such redress
 or if there were it not belongs to you
mowbray why not to him in part and to us all
 that feel the bruises of the days before
 and suffer the condition of these times
 to lay a heavy and unequal hand
 upon our honours
westmoreland o my good lord mowbray
 construe the times to their necessities
 and you shall say indeed it is the time
 and not the king that doth you injuries
 yet for your part it not appears to me
 either from the king or in the present time
 that you should have an inch of any ground
 to build a grief on were you not restored
 to all the duke of norfolk's signories
 your noble and right well remember'd father's
mowbray what thing in honour had my father lost
 that need to be revived and breathed in me
 the king that loved him as the state stood then
 was force perforce compell'd to banish him
 and then that harry bolingbroke and he
 being mounted and both roused in their seats
 their neighing coursers daring of the spur
 their armed staves in charge their beavers down
 their eyes of fire sparking through sights of steel
 and the loud trumpet blowing them together
 then then when there was nothing could have stay'd
 my father from the breast of bolingbroke
 o when the king did throw his warder down
 his own life hung upon the staff he threw
 then threw he down himself and all their lives
 that by indictment and by dint of sword
 have since miscarried under bolingbroke
westmoreland you speak lord mowbray now you know not what
 the earl of hereford was reputed then
 in england the most valiant gentlemen
 who knows on whom fortune would then have smiled
 but if your father had been victor there
 he ne'er had borne it out of coventry
 for all the country in a general voice
 cried hate upon him and all their prayers and love
 were set on hereford whom they doted on
 and bless'd and graced indeed more than the king
 but this is mere digression from my purpose
 here come i from our princely general
 to know your griefs to tell you from his grace
 that he will give you audience and wherein
 it shall appear that your demands are just
 you shall enjoy them every thing set off
 that might so much as think you enemies
mowbray but he hath forced us to compel this offer
 and it proceeds from policy not love
westmoreland mowbray you overween to take it so
 this offer comes from mercy not from fear
 for lo within a ken our army lies
 upon mine honour all too confident
 to give admittance to a thought of fear
 our battle is more full of names than yours
 our men more perfect in the use of arms
 our armour all as strong our cause the best
 then reason will our heart should be as good
 say you not then our offer is compell'd
mowbray well by my will we shall admit no parley
westmoreland that argues but the shame of your offence
 a rotten case abides no handling
hastings hath the prince john a full commission
 in very ample virtue of his father
 to hear and absolutely to determine
 of what conditions we shall stand upon
westmoreland that is intended in the general's name
 i muse you make so slight a question
archbishop of york then take my lord of westmoreland this schedule
 for this contains our general grievances
 each several article herein redress'd
 all members of our cause both here and hence
 that are insinew'd to this action
 acquitted by a true substantial form
 and present execution of our wills
 to us and to our purposes confined
 we come within our awful banks again
 and knit our powers to the arm of peace
westmoreland this will i show the general please you lords
 in sight of both our battles we may meet
 and either end in peace which god so frame
 or to the place of difference call the swords
 which must decide it
archbishop of york my lord we will do so
 exit westmoreland
mowbray there is a thing within my bosom tells me
 that no conditions of our peace can stand
hastings fear you not that if we can make our peace
 upon such large terms and so absolute
 as our conditions shall consist upon
 our peace shall stand as firm as rocky mountains
mowbray yea but our valuation shall be such
 that every slight and falsederived cause
 yea every idle nice and wanton reason
 shall to the king taste of this action
 that were our royal faiths martyrs in love
 we shall be winnow'd with so rough a wind
 that even our corn shall seem as light as chaff
 and good from bad find no partition
archbishop of york no no my lord note this the king is weary
 of dainty and such picking grievances
 for he hath found to end one doubt by death
 revives two greater in the heirs of life
 and therefore will he wipe his tables clean
 and keep no telltale to his memory
 that may repeat and history his loss
 to new remembrance for full well he knows
 he cannot so precisely weed this land
 as his misdoubts present occasion
 his foes are so enrooted with his friends
 that plucking to unfix an enemy
 he doth unfasten so and shake a friend
 so that this land like an offensive wife
 that hath enraged him on to offer strokes
 as he is striking holds his infant up
 and hangs resolved correction in the arm
