moth that an eel is quick
don
adriano de armado i do say thou art quick in answers thou heatest my blood
moth i am answered sir
don
adriano de armado i love not to be crossed
moth aside he speaks the mere contrary crosses love not him
don
adriano de armado i have promised to study three years with the duke
moth you may do it in an hour sir
don
adriano de armado impossible
moth how many is one thrice told
don
adriano de armado i am ill at reckoning it fitteth the spirit of a tapster
moth you are a gentleman and a gamester sir
don
adriano de armado i confess both they are both the varnish of a
 complete man
moth then i am sure you know how much the gross sum of
 deuceace amounts to
don
adriano de armado it doth amount to one more than two
moth which the base vulgar do call three
don
adriano de armado true
moth why sir is this such a piece of study now here
 is three studied ere ye'll thrice wink and how
 easy it is to put years to the word three and
 study three years in two words the dancing horse
 will tell you
don
adriano de armado a most fine figure
moth to prove you a cipher
don
adriano de armado i will hereupon confess i am in love and as it is
 base for a soldier to love so am i in love with a
 base wench if drawing my sword against the humour
 of affection would deliver me from the reprobate
 thought of it i would take desire prisoner and
 ransom him to any french courtier for a newdevised
 courtesy i think scorn to sigh methinks i should
 outswear cupid comfort me boy what great men
 have been in love
moth hercules master
don
adriano de armado most sweet hercules more authority dear boy name
 more and sweet my child let them be men of good
 repute and carriage
moth samson master he was a man of good carriage great
 carriage for he carried the towngates on his back
 like a porter and he was in love
don
adriano de armado o wellknit samson strongjointed samson i do
 excel thee in my rapier as much as thou didst me in
 carrying gates i am in love too who was samson's
 love my dear moth
moth a woman master
don
adriano de armado of what complexion
moth of all the four or the three or the two or one of the four
don
adriano de armado tell me precisely of what complexion
moth of the seawater green sir
don
adriano de armado is that one of the four complexions
moth as i have read sir and the best of them too
don
adriano de armado green indeed is the colour of lovers but to have a
 love of that colour methinks samson had small reason
 for it he surely affected her for her wit
moth it was so sir for she had a green wit
don
adriano de armado my love is most immaculate white and red
moth most maculate thoughts master are masked under
 such colours
don
adriano de armado define define welleducated infant
moth my father's wit and my mother's tongue assist me
don
adriano de armado sweet invocation of a child most pretty and
 pathetical
moth if she be made of white and red
 her faults will ne'er be known
 for blushing cheeks by faults are bred
 and fears by pale white shown
 then if she fear or be to blame
 by this you shall not know
 for still her cheeks possess the same
 which native she doth owe
 a dangerous rhyme master against the reason of
 white and red
don
adriano de armado is there not a ballad boy of the king and the beggar
moth the world was very guilty of such a ballad some
 three ages since but i think now tis not to be
 found or if it were it would neither serve for
 the writing nor the tune
don
adriano de armado i will have that subject newly writ o'er that i may
 example my digression by some mighty precedent
 boy i do love that country girl that i took in the
 park with the rational hind costard she deserves well
moth aside to be whipped and yet a better love than
 my master
don
adriano de armado sing boy my spirit grows heavy in love
moth and that's great marvel loving a light wench
don
adriano de armado i say sing
moth forbear till this company be past
 enter dull costard and jaquenetta
dull sir the duke's pleasure is that you keep costard
 safe and you must suffer him to take no delight
 nor no penance but a must fast three days a week
 for this damsel i must keep her at the park she
 is allowed for the daywoman fare you well
don
adriano de armado i do betray myself with blushing maid
jaquenetta man
don
adriano de armado i will visit thee at the lodge
jaquenetta that's hereby
don
adriano de armado i know where it is situate
jaquenetta lord how wise you are
don
adriano de armado i will tell thee wonders
jaquenetta with that face
don
adriano de armado i love thee
jaquenetta so i heard you say
don
adriano de armado and so farewell
jaquenetta fair weather after you
dull come jaquenetta away
 exeunt dull and jaquenetta
don
adriano de armado villain thou shalt fast for thy offences ere thou
 be pardoned
costard well sir i hope when i do it i shall do it on a
 full stomach
don
adriano de armado thou shalt be heavily punished
costard i am more bound to you than your fellows for they
 are but lightly rewarded
don
adriano de armado take away this villain shut him up
moth come you transgressing slave away
costard let me not be pent up sir i will fast being loose
moth no sir that were fast and loose thou shalt to prison
costard well if ever i do see the merry days of desolation
 that i have seen some shall see
moth what shall some see
costard nay nothing master moth but what they look upon
 it is not for prisoners to be too silent in their
 words and therefore i will say nothing i thank
 god i have as little patience as another man and
 therefore i can be quiet
 exeunt moth and costard
don
adriano de armado i do affect the very ground which is base where
 her shoe which is baser guided by her foot which
 is basest doth tread i shall be forsworn which
 is a great argument of falsehood if i love and
 how can that be true love which is falsely
 attempted love is a familiar love is a devil
 there is no evil angel but love yet was samson so
 tempted and he had an excellent strength yet was
 solomon so seduced and he had a very good wit
 cupid's buttshaft is too hard for hercules club
 and therefore too much odds for a spaniard's rapier
 the first and second cause will not serve my turn
 the passado he respects not the duello he regards
 not his disgrace is to be called boy but his
 glory is to subdue men adieu valour rust rapier
 be still drum for your manager is in love yea
 he loveth assist me some extemporal god of rhyme
 for i am sure i shall turn sonnet devise wit
 write pen for i am for whole volumes in folio
 exit
 love's labours lost
act ii
scene i the same
 enter the princess of france rosaline maria
 katharine boyet lords and other attendants
boyet now madam summon up your dearest spirits
 consider who the king your father sends
 to whom he sends and what's his embassy
 yourself held precious in the world's esteem
 to parley with the sole inheritor
 of all perfections that a man may owe
