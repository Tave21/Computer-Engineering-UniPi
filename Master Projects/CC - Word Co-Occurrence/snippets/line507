benedick thy wit is as quick as the greyhound's mouth it catches
margaret and yours as blunt as the fencer's foils which hit
 but hurt not
benedick a most manly wit margaret it will not hurt a
 woman and so i pray thee call beatrice i give
 thee the bucklers
margaret give us the swords we have bucklers of our own
benedick if you use them margaret you must put in the
 pikes with a vice and they are dangerous weapons for maids
margaret well i will call beatrice to you who i think hath legs
benedick and therefore will come
 exit margaret
 sings
 the god of love
 that sits above
 and knows me and knows me
 how pitiful i deserve
 i mean in singing but in loving leander the good
 swimmer troilus the first employer of panders and
 a whole bookful of these quondam carpetmangers
 whose names yet run smoothly in the even road of a
 blank verse why they were never so truly turned
 over and over as my poor self in love marry i
 cannot show it in rhyme i have tried i can find
 out no rhyme to lady but baby an innocent
 rhyme for scorn horn a hard rhyme for
 school fool a babbling rhyme very ominous
 endings no i was not born under a rhyming planet
 nor i cannot woo in festival terms
 enter beatrice
 sweet beatrice wouldst thou come when i called thee
beatrice yea signior and depart when you bid me
benedick o stay but till then
beatrice then is spoken fare you well now and yet ere
 i go let me go with that i came which is with
 knowing what hath passed between you and claudio
benedick only foul words and thereupon i will kiss thee
beatrice foul words is but foul wind and foul wind is but
 foul breath and foul breath is noisome therefore i
 will depart unkissed
benedick thou hast frighted the word out of his right sense
 so forcible is thy wit but i must tell thee
 plainly claudio undergoes my challenge and either
 i must shortly hear from him or i will subscribe
 him a coward and i pray thee now tell me for
 which of my bad parts didst thou first fall in love with me
beatrice for them all together which maintained so politic
 a state of evil that they will not admit any good
 part to intermingle with them but for which of my
 good parts did you first suffer love for me
benedick suffer love a good epithet i do suffer love
 indeed for i love thee against my will
beatrice in spite of your heart i think alas poor heart
 if you spite it for my sake i will spite it for
 yours for i will never love that which my friend hates
benedick thou and i are too wise to woo peaceably
beatrice it appears not in this confession there's not one
 wise man among twenty that will praise himself
benedick an old an old instance beatrice that lived in
 the lime of good neighbours if a man do not erect
 in this age his own tomb ere he dies he shall live
 no longer in monument than the bell rings and the
 widow weeps
beatrice and how long is that think you
benedick question why an hour in clamour and a quarter in
 rheum therefore is it most expedient for the
 wise if don worm his conscience find no
 impediment to the contrary to be the trumpet of his
 own virtues as i am to myself so much for
 praising myself who i myself will bear witness is
 praiseworthy and now tell me how doth your cousin
beatrice very ill
benedick and how do you
beatrice very ill too
benedick serve god love me and mend there will i leave
 you too for here comes one in haste

 done to death by slanderous tongues

 death in guerdon of her wrongs
 gives her fame which never dies
 so the life that died with shame
 lives in death with glorious fame
 hang thou there upon the tomb
 praising her when i am dumb
 now music sound and sing your solemn hymn
 song
 pardon goddess of the night
 those that slew thy virgin knight
 for the which with songs of woe
 round about her tomb they go
 midnight assist our moan

 heavily heavily
 graves yawn and yield your dead
 till death be uttered
 heavily heavily
claudio now unto thy bones good night
 yearly will i do this rite
don pedro good morrow masters put your torches out
 the wolves have prey'd and look the gentle day
 before the wheels of phoebus round about
 dapples the drowsy east with spots of grey
