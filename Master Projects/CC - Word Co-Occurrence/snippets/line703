scene v the same
 enter the king of france the dauphin the duke of
 bourbon the constable of france and others
king of france tis certain he hath pass'd the river somme
constable and if he be not fought withal my lord
 let us not live in france let us quit all
 and give our vineyards to a barbarous people
dauphin o dieu vivant shall a few sprays of us
 the emptying of our fathers luxury
 our scions put in wild and savage stock
 spirt up so suddenly into the clouds
 and overlook their grafters
bourbon normans but bastard normans norman bastards
 mort de ma vie if they march along
 unfought withal but i will sell my dukedom
 to buy a slobbery and a dirty farm
 in that nookshotten isle of albion
constable dieu de batailles where have they this mettle
 is not their climate foggy raw and dull
 on whom as in despite the sun looks pale
 killing their fruit with frowns can sodden water
 a drench for surrein'd jades their barleybroth
 decoct their cold blood to such valiant heat
 and shall our quick blood spirited with wine
 seem frosty o for honour of our land
 let us not hang like roping icicles
 upon our houses thatch whiles a more frosty people
 sweat drops of gallant youth in our rich fields
 poor we may call them in their native lords
dauphin by faith and honour
 our madams mock at us and plainly say
 our mettle is bred out and they will give
 their bodies to the lust of english youth
 to newstore france with bastard warriors
bourbon they bid us to the english dancingschools
 and teach lavoltas high and swift corantos
 saying our grace is only in our heels
 and that we are most lofty runaways
king of france where is montjoy the herald speed him hence
 let him greet england with our sharp defiance
 up princes and with spirit of honour edged
 more sharper than your swords hie to the field
 charles delabreth high constable of france
 you dukes of orleans bourbon and of berri
 alencon brabant bar and burgundy
 jaques chatillon rambures vaudemont
 beaumont grandpre roussi and fauconberg
 foix lestrale bouciqualt and charolois
 high dukes great princes barons lords and knights
 for your great seats now quit you of great shames
 bar harry england that sweeps through our land
 with pennons painted in the blood of harfleur
 rush on his host as doth the melted snow
 upon the valleys whose low vassal seat
 the alps doth spit and void his rheum upon
 go down upon him you have power enough
 and in a captive chariot into rouen
 bring him our prisoner
constable this becomes the great
 sorry am i his numbers are so few
 his soldiers sick and famish'd in their march
 for i am sure when he shall see our army
 he'll drop his heart into the sink of fear
 and for achievement offer us his ransom
king of france therefore lord constable haste on montjoy
 and let him say to england that we send
 to know what willing ransom he will give
 prince dauphin you shall stay with us in rouen
dauphin not so i do beseech your majesty
king of france be patient for you shall remain with us
 now forth lord constable and princes all
 and quickly bring us word of england's fall

 king henry v
act iii
scene vi the english camp in picardy
 enter gower and fluellen meeting
gower how now captain fluellen come you from the bridge
fluellen i assure you there is very excellent services
 committed at the bridge
gower is the duke of exeter safe
fluellen the duke of exeter is as magnanimous as agamemnon
 and a man that i love and honour with my soul and my
 heart and my duty and my life and my living and
 my uttermost power he is notgod be praised and
 blessedany hurt in the world but keeps the
 bridge most valiantly with excellent discipline
 there is an aunchient lieutenant there at the
 pridge i think in my very conscience he is as
 valiant a man as mark antony and he is a man of no
 estimation in the world but did see him do as
 gallant service
gower what do you call him
fluellen he is called aunchient pistol
gower i know him not
 enter pistol
fluellen here is the man
pistol captain i thee beseech to do me favours
 the duke of exeter doth love thee well
fluellen ay i praise god and i have merited some love at
 his hands
pistol bardolph a soldier firm and sound of heart
 and of buxom valour hath by cruel fate
 and giddy fortune's furious fickle wheel
 that goddess blind
 that stands upon the rolling restless stone
fluellen by your patience aunchient pistol fortune is
 painted blind with a muffler afore her eyes to
 signify to you that fortune is blind and she is
 painted also with a wheel to signify to you which
 is the moral of it that she is turning and
 inconstant and mutability and variation and her
 foot look you is fixed upon a spherical stone
 which rolls and rolls and rolls in good truth
 the poet makes a most excellent description of it
 fortune is an excellent moral
pistol fortune is bardolph's foe and frowns on him
 for he hath stolen a pax and hanged must a be
 a damned death
 let gallows gape for dog let man go free
 and let not hemp his windpipe suffocate
 but exeter hath given the doom of death
 for pax of little price
 therefore go speak the duke will hear thy voice
 and let not bardolph's vital thread be cut
 with edge of penny cord and vile reproach
 speak captain for his life and i will thee requite
fluellen aunchient pistol i do partly understand your meaning
pistol why then rejoice therefore
fluellen certainly aunchient it is not a thing to rejoice
 at for if look you he were my brother i would
 desire the duke to use his good pleasure and put
 him to execution for discipline ought to be used
pistol die and be damn'd and figo for thy friendship
fluellen it is well
pistol the fig of spain
 exit
fluellen very good
gower why this is an arrant counterfeit rascal i
 remember him now a bawd a cutpurse
fluellen i'll assure you a uttered as brave words at the
 bridge as you shall see in a summer's day but it
 is very well what he has spoke to me that is well
 i warrant you when time is serve
gower why tis a gull a fool a rogue that now and then
 goes to the wars to grace himself at his return
 into london under the form of a soldier and such
 fellows are perfect in the great commanders names
 and they will learn you by rote where services were
 done at such and such a sconce at such a breach
 at such a convoy who came off bravely who was
 shot who disgraced what terms the enemy stood on
 and this they con perfectly in the phrase of war
 which they trick up with newtuned oaths and what
 a beard of the general's cut and a horrid suit of
 the camp will do among foaming bottles and
 alewashed wits is wonderful to be thought on but
 you must learn to know such slanders of the age or
 else you may be marvellously mistook
fluellen i tell you what captain gower i do perceive he is
 not the man that he would gladly make show to the
 world he is if i find a hole in his coat i will
 tell him my mind
 drum heard
 hark you the king is coming and i must speak with
 him from the pridge
 drum and colours enter king henry gloucester and soldiers
 god pless your majesty
king henry v how now fluellen camest thou from the bridge
fluellen ay so please your majesty the duke of exeter has
 very gallantly maintained the pridge the french is
 gone off look you and there is gallant and most
 prave passages marry th athversary was have
 possession of the pridge but he is enforced to
 retire and the duke of exeter is master of the
 pridge i can tell your majesty the duke is a
 prave man
king henry v what men have you lost fluellen
fluellen the perdition of th athversary hath been very
 great reasonable great marry for my part i
 think the duke hath lost never a man but one that
 is like to be executed for robbing a church one
 bardolph if your majesty know the man his face is
 all bubukles and whelks and knobs and flames o'
 fire and his lips blows at his nose and it is like
 a coal of fire sometimes plue and sometimes red
 but his nose is executed and his fire's out
king henry v we would have all such offenders so cut off and we
 give express charge that in our marches through the
