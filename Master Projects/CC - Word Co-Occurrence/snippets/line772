 which well appeared in his lineaments
 being nothing like the noble duke my father
 but touch this sparingly as twere far off
 because you know my lord my mother lives
buckingham fear not my lord i'll play the orator
 as if the golden fee for which i plead
 were for myself and so my lord adieu
gloucester if you thrive well bring them to baynard's castle
 where you shall find me well accompanied
 with reverend fathers and welllearned bishops
buckingham i go and towards three or four o'clock
 look for the news that the guildhall affords
 exit buckingham
gloucester go lovel with all speed to doctor shaw
 to catesby
 go thou to friar penker bid them both
 meet me within this hour at baynard's castle
 exeunt all but gloucester
 now will i in to take some privy order
 to draw the brats of clarence out of sight
 and to give notice that no manner of person
 at any time have recourse unto the princes
 exit
 king richard iii
act iii
scene vi the same
 enter a scrivener with a paper in his hand
scrivener this is the indictment of the good lord hastings
 which in a set hand fairly is engross'd
 that it may be this day read over in paul's
 and mark how well the sequel hangs together
 eleven hours i spent to write it over
 for yesternight by catesby was it brought me
 the precedent was full as long adoing
 and yet within these five hours lived lord hastings
 untainted unexamined free at liberty
 here's a good world the while why who's so gross
 that seeth not this palpable device
 yet who's so blind but says he sees it not
 bad is the world and all will come to nought
 when such bad dealings must be seen in thought
 exit
 king richard iii
act iii
scene vii baynard's castle
 enter gloucester and buckingham at several doors
gloucester how now my lord what say the citizens
buckingham now by the holy mother of our lord
 the citizens are mum and speak not a word
gloucester touch'd you the bastardy of edward's children
buckingham i did with his contract with lady lucy
 and his contract by deputy in france
 the insatiate greediness of his desires
 and his enforcement of the city wives
 his tyranny for trifles his own bastardy
 as being got your father then in france
 his resemblance being not like the duke
 withal i did infer your lineaments
 being the right idea of your father
 both in your form and nobleness of mind
 laid open all your victories in scotland
 your dicipline in war wisdom in peace
 your bounty virtue fair humility
 indeed left nothing fitting for the purpose
 untouch'd or slightly handled in discourse
 and when mine oratory grew to an end
 i bid them that did love their country's good
 cry god save richard england's royal king'
gloucester ah and did they so
buckingham no so god help me they spake not a word
 but like dumb statues or breathing stones
 gazed each on other and look'd deadly pale
 which when i saw i reprehended them
 and ask'd the mayor what meant this wilful silence
 his answer was the people were not wont
 to be spoke to but by the recorder
 then he was urged to tell my tale again
 thus saith the duke thus hath the duke inferr'd'
 but nothing spake in warrant from himself
 when he had done some followers of mine own
 at the lower end of the hall hurl'd up their caps
 and some ten voices cried god save king richard'
 and thus i took the vantage of those few
 thanks gentle citizens and friends quoth i
 this general applause and loving shout
 argues your wisdoms and your love to richard'
 and even here brake off and came away
gloucester what tongueless blocks were they would not they speak
buckingham no by my troth my lord
gloucester will not the mayor then and his brethren come
buckingham the mayor is here at hand intend some fear
 be not you spoke with but by mighty suit
 and look you get a prayerbook in your hand
 and stand betwixt two churchmen good my lord
 for on that ground i'll build a holy descant
 and be not easily won to our request
 play the maid's part still answer nay and take it
gloucester i go and if you plead as well for them
 as i can say nay to thee for myself
 no doubt well bring it to a happy issue
buckingham go go up to the leads the lord mayor knocks
 exit gloucester
 enter the lord mayor and citizens
 welcome my lord i dance attendance here
 i think the duke will not be spoke withal
 enter catesby
 here comes his servant how now catesby
 what says he
catesby my lord he doth entreat your grace
 to visit him tomorrow or next day
 he is within with two right reverend fathers
 divinely bent to meditation
 and no worldly suit would he be moved
 to draw him from his holy exercise
buckingham return good catesby to thy lord again
 tell him myself the mayor and citizens
 in deep designs and matters of great moment
 no less importing than our general good
 are come to have some conference with his grace
catesby i'll tell him what you say my lord
 exit
buckingham ah ha my lord this prince is not an edward
 he is not lolling on a lewd daybed
 but on his knees at meditation
 not dallying with a brace of courtezans
 but meditating with two deep divines
 not sleeping to engross his idle body
 but praying to enrich his watchful soul
 happy were england would this gracious prince
 take on himself the sovereignty thereof
 but sure i fear we shall ne'er win him to it
lord mayor marry god forbid his grace should say us nay
buckingham i fear he will
 reenter catesby
 how now catesby what says your lord
catesby my lord
 he wonders to what end you have assembled
 such troops of citizens to speak with him
 his grace not being warn'd thereof before
 my lord he fears you mean no good to him
buckingham sorry i am my noble cousin should
 suspect me that i mean no good to him
 by heaven i come in perfect love to him
 and so once more return and tell his grace
 exit catesby
 when holy and devout religious men
 are at their beads tis hard to draw them thence
 so sweet is zealous contemplation
 enter gloucester aloft between two bishops
 catesby returns
lord mayor see where he stands between two clergymen
buckingham two props of virtue for a christian prince
 to stay him from the fall of vanity
 and see a book of prayer in his hand
 true ornaments to know a holy man
 famous plantagenet most gracious prince
 lend favourable ears to our request
 and pardon us the interruption
 of thy devotion and right christian zeal
gloucester my lord there needs no such apology
 i rather do beseech you pardon me
 who earnest in the service of my god
 neglect the visitation of my friends
 but leaving this what is your grace's pleasure
buckingham even that i hope which pleaseth god above
 and all good men of this ungovern'd isle
gloucester i do suspect i have done some offence
 that seems disgracious in the city's eyes
 and that you come to reprehend my ignorance
buckingham you have my lord would it might please your grace
 at our entreaties to amend that fault
gloucester else wherefore breathe i in a christian land
buckingham then know it is your fault that you resign
 the supreme seat the throne majestical
 the scepter'd office of your ancestors
 your state of fortune and your due of birth
 the lineal glory of your royal house
 to the corruption of a blemished stock
 whilst in the mildness of your sleepy thoughts
 which here we waken to our country's good
 this noble isle doth want her proper limbs
 her face defaced with scars of infamy
 her royal stock graft with ignoble plants
 and almost shoulder'd in the swallowing gulf
 of blind forgetfulness and dark oblivion
 which to recure we heartily solicit
 your gracious self to take on you the charge
 and kingly government of this your land
 not as protector steward substitute
 or lowly factor for another's gain
 but as successively from blood to blood
 your right of birth your empery your own
 for this consorted with the citizens
 your very worshipful and loving friends
 and by their vehement instigation
 in this just suit come i to move your grace
gloucester i know not whether to depart in silence
 or bitterly to speak in your reproof
 best fitteth my degree or your condition
 if not to answer you might haply think
