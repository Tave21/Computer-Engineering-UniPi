then the high priest and the chief of the jews informed him against paul and besought him
and desired favour against him that he would send for him to jerusalem laying wait in the way to kill him
but festus answered that paul should be kept at caesarea and that he himself would depart shortly thither
let them therefore said he which among you are able go down with me and accuse this man if there be any wickedness in him
and when he had tarried among them more than ten days he went down unto caesarea and the next day sitting on the judgment seat commanded paul to be brought
and when he was come the jews which came down from jerusalem stood round about and laid many and grievous complaints against paul which they could not prove
while he answered for himself neither against the law of the jews neither against the temple nor yet against caesar have i offended any thing at all
but festus willing to do the jews a pleasure answered paul and said wilt thou go up to jerusalem and there be judged of these things before me
then said paul i stand at caesar's judgment seat where i ought to be judged to the jews have i done no wrong as thou very well knowest
for if i be an offender or have committed any thing worthy of death i refuse not to die but if there be none of these things whereof these accuse me no man may deliver me unto them i appeal unto caesar
then festus when he had conferred with the council answered hast thou appealed unto caesar unto caesar shalt thou go
and after certain days king agrippa and bernice came unto caesarea to salute festus
and when they had been there many days festus declared paul's cause unto the king saying there is a certain man left in bonds by felix
about whom when i was at jerusalem the chief priests and the elders of the jews informed me desiring to have judgment against him
to whom i answered it is not the manner of the romans to deliver any man to die before that he which is accused have the accusers face to face and have licence to answer for himself concerning the crime laid against him
therefore when they were come hither without any delay on the morrow i sat on the judgment seat and commanded the man to be brought forth
against whom when the accusers stood up they brought none accusation of such things as i supposed
but had certain questions against him of their own superstition and of one jesus which was dead whom paul affirmed to be alive
and because i doubted of such manner of questions i asked him whether he would go to jerusalem and there be judged of these matters
but when paul had appealed to be reserved unto the hearing of augustus i commanded him to be kept till i might send him to caesar
then agrippa said unto festus i would also hear the man myself to morrow said he thou shalt hear him
and on the morrow when agrippa was come and bernice with great pomp and was entered into the place of hearing with the chief captains and principal men of the city at festus commandment paul was brought forth
and festus said king agrippa and all men which are here present with us ye see this man about whom all the multitude of the jews have dealt with me both at jerusalem and also here crying that he ought not to live any longer
but when i found that he had committed nothing worthy of death and that he himself hath appealed to augustus i have determined to send him
of whom i have no certain thing to write unto my lord wherefore i have brought him forth before you and specially before thee o king agrippa that after examination had i might have somewhat to write
for it seemeth to me unreasonable to send a prisoner and not withal to signify the crimes laid against him
then agrippa said unto paul thou art permitted to speak for thyself then paul stretched forth the hand and answered for himself
i think myself happy king agrippa because i shall answer for myself this day before thee touching all the things whereof i am accused of the jews
especially because i know thee to be expert in all customs and questions which are among the jews wherefore i beseech thee to hear me patiently
my manner of life from my youth which was at the first among mine own nation at jerusalem know all the jews
which knew me from the beginning if they would testify that after the most straitest sect of our religion i lived a pharisee
and now i stand and am judged for the hope of the promise made of god unto our fathers
unto which promise our twelve tribes instantly serving god day and night hope to come for which hope's sake king agrippa i am accused of the jews
why should it be thought a thing incredible with you that god should raise the dead
i verily thought with myself that i ought to do many things contrary to the name of jesus of nazareth
which thing i also did in jerusalem and many of the saints did i shut up in prison having received authority from the chief priests and when they were put to death i gave my voice against them
and i punished them oft in every synagogue and compelled them to blaspheme and being exceedingly mad against them i persecuted them even unto strange cities
whereupon as i went to damascus with authority and commission from the chief priests
at midday o king i saw in the way a light from heaven above the brightness of the sun shining round about me and them which journeyed with me
and when we were all fallen to the earth i heard a voice speaking unto me and saying in the hebrew tongue saul saul why persecutest thou me it is hard for thee to kick against the pricks
and i said who art thou lord and he said i am jesus whom thou persecutest
but rise and stand upon thy feet for i have appeared unto thee for this purpose to make thee a minister and a witness both of these things which thou hast seen and of those things in the which i will appear unto thee
delivering thee from the people and from the gentiles unto whom now i send thee
to open their eyes and to turn them from darkness to light and from the power of satan unto god that they may receive forgiveness of sins and inheritance among them which are sanctified by faith that is in me
whereupon o king agrippa i was not disobedient unto the heavenly vision
but shewed first unto them of damascus and at jerusalem and throughout all the coasts of judaea and then to the gentiles that they should repent and turn to god and do works meet for repentance
for these causes the jews caught me in the temple and went about to kill me
having therefore obtained help of god i continue unto this day witnessing both to small and great saying none other things than those which the prophets and moses did say should come
that christ should suffer and that he should be the first that should rise from the dead and should shew light unto the people and to the gentiles
and as he thus spake for himself festus said with a loud voice paul thou art beside thyself much learning doth make thee mad
but he said i am not mad most noble festus but speak forth the words of truth and soberness
for the king knoweth of these things before whom also i speak freely for i am persuaded that none of these things are hidden from him for this thing was not done in a corner
king agrippa believest thou the prophets i know that thou believest
then agrippa said unto paul almost thou persuadest me to be a christian
and paul said i would to god that not only thou but also all that hear me this day were both almost and altogether such as i am except these bonds
and when he had thus spoken the king rose up and the governor and bernice and they that sat with them
and when they were gone aside they talked between themselves saying this man doeth nothing worthy of death or of bonds
then said agrippa unto festus this man might have been set at liberty if he had not appealed unto caesar
and when it was determined that we should sail into italy they delivered paul and certain other prisoners unto one named julius a centurion of augustus band
and entering into a ship of adramyttium we launched meaning to sail by the coasts of asia one aristarchus a macedonian of thessalonica being with us
and the next day we touched at sidon and julius courteously entreated paul and gave him liberty to go unto his friends to refresh himself
and when we had launched from thence we sailed under cyprus because the winds were contrary
and when we had sailed over the sea of cilicia and pamphylia we came to myra a city of lycia
and there the centurion found a ship of alexandria sailing into italy and he put us therein
and when we had sailed slowly many days and scarce were come over against cnidus the wind not suffering us we sailed under crete over against salmone
and hardly passing it came unto a place which is called the fair havens nigh whereunto was the city of lasea
now when much time was spent and when sailing was now dangerous because the fast was now already past paul admonished them
and said unto them sirs i perceive that this voyage will be with hurt and much damage not only of the lading and ship but also of our lives
nevertheless the centurion believed the master and the owner of the ship more than those things which were spoken by paul
and because the haven was not commodious to winter in the more part advised to depart thence also if by any means they might attain to phenice and there to winter which is an haven of crete and lieth toward the south west and north west
and when the south wind blew softly supposing that they had obtained their purpose loosing thence they sailed close by crete
but not long after there arose against it a tempestuous wind called euroclydon
and when the ship was caught and could not bear up into the wind we let her drive
and running under a certain island which is called clauda we had much work to come by the boat
which when they had taken up they used helps undergirding the ship and fearing lest they should fall into the quicksands strake sail and so were driven
and we being exceedingly tossed with a tempest the next day they lightened the ship
and the third day we cast out with our own hands the tackling of the ship
and when neither sun nor stars in many days appeared and no small tempest lay on us all hope that we should be saved was then taken away
but after long abstinence paul stood forth in the midst of them and said sirs ye should have hearkened unto me and not have loosed from crete and to have gained this harm and loss
and now i exhort you to be of good cheer for there shall be no loss of any man's life among you but of the ship
for there stood by me this night the angel of god whose i am and whom i serve
saying fear not paul thou must be brought before caesar and lo god hath given thee all them that sail with thee
wherefore sirs be of good cheer for i believe god that it shall be even as it was told me
howbeit we must be cast upon a certain island
but when the fourteenth night was come as we were driven up and down in adria about midnight the shipmen deemed that they drew near to some country
and sounded and found it twenty fathoms and when they had gone a little further they sounded again and found it fifteen fathoms
then fearing lest we should have fallen upon rocks they cast four anchors out of the stern and wished for the day
and as the shipmen were about to flee out of the ship when they had let down the boat into the sea under colour as though they would have cast anchors out of the foreship
paul said to the centurion and to the soldiers except these abide in the ship ye cannot be saved
then the soldiers cut off the ropes of the boat and let her fall off
and while the day was coming on paul besought them all to take meat saying this day is the fourteenth day that ye have tarried and continued fasting having taken nothing
wherefore i pray you to take some meat for this is for your health for there shall not an hair fall from the head of any of you
and when he had thus spoken he took bread and gave thanks to god in presence of them all and when he had broken it he began to eat
then were they all of good cheer and they also took some meat
and we were in all in the ship two hundred threescore and sixteen souls
and when they had eaten enough they lightened the ship and cast out the wheat into the sea
and when it was day they knew not the land but they discovered a certain creek with a shore into the which they were minded if it were possible to thrust in the ship
and when they had taken up the anchors they committed themselves unto the sea and loosed the rudder bands and hoised up the mainsail to the wind and made toward shore
and falling into a place where two seas met they ran the ship aground and the forepart stuck fast and remained unmoveable but the hinder part was broken with the violence of the waves
and the soldiers counsel was to kill the prisoners lest any of them should swim out and escape
but the centurion willing to save paul kept them from their purpose and commanded that they which could swim should cast themselves first into the sea and get to land
and the rest some on boards and some on broken pieces of the ship and so it came to pass that they escaped all safe to land
and when they were escaped then they knew that the island was called melita
and the barbarous people shewed us no little kindness for they kindled a fire and received us every one because of the present rain and because of the cold
and when paul had gathered a bundle of sticks and laid them on the fire there came a viper out of the heat and fastened on his hand
and when the barbarians saw the venomous beast hang on his hand they said among themselves no doubt this man is a murderer whom though he hath escaped the sea yet vengeance suffereth not to live
and he shook off the beast into the fire and felt no harm
howbeit they looked when he should have swollen or fallen down dead suddenly but after they had looked a great while and saw no harm come to him they changed their minds and said that he was a god
in the same quarters were possessions of the chief man of the island whose name was publius who received us and lodged us three days courteously
and it came to pass that the father of publius lay sick of a fever and of a bloody flux to whom paul entered in and prayed and laid his hands on him and healed him
so when this was done others also which had diseases in the island came and were healed
who also honoured us with many honours and when we departed they laded us with such things as were necessary
and after three months we departed in a ship of alexandria which had wintered in the isle whose sign was castor and pollux
and landing at syracuse we tarried there three days
and from thence we fetched a compass and came to rhegium and after one day the south wind blew and we came the next day to puteoli
where we found brethren and were desired to tarry with them seven days and so we went toward rome
and from thence when the brethren heard of us they came to meet us as far as appii forum and the three taverns whom when paul saw he thanked god and took courage
and when we came to rome the centurion delivered the prisoners to the captain of the guard but paul was suffered to dwell by himself with a soldier that kept him
and it came to pass that after three days paul called the chief of the jews together and when they were come together he said unto them men and brethren though i have committed nothing against the people or customs of our fathers yet was i delivered prisoner from jerusalem into the hands of the romans
who when they had examined me would have let me go because there was no cause of death in me
but when the jews spake against it i was constrained to appeal unto caesar not that i had ought to accuse my nation of
for this cause therefore have i called for you to see you and to speak with you because that for the hope of israel i am bound with this chain
and they said unto him we neither received letters out of judaea concerning thee neither any of the brethren that came shewed or spake any harm of thee
but we desire to hear of thee what thou thinkest for as concerning this sect we know that every where it is spoken against
and when they had appointed him a day there came many to him into his lodging to whom he expounded and testified the kingdom of god persuading them concerning jesus both out of the law of moses and out of the prophets from morning till evening
and some believed the things which were spoken and some believed not
and when they agreed not among themselves they departed after that paul had spoken one word well spake the holy ghost by esaias the prophet unto our fathers
saying go unto this people and say hearing ye shall hear and shall not understand and seeing ye shall see and not perceive
for the heart of this people is waxed gross and their ears are dull of hearing and their eyes have they closed lest they should see with their eyes and hear with their ears and understand with their heart and should be converted and i should heal them
be it known therefore unto you that the salvation of god is sent unto the gentiles and that they will hear it
and when he had said these words the jews departed and had great reasoning among themselves
and paul dwelt two whole years in his own hired house and received all that came in unto him
preaching the kingdom of god and teaching those things which concern the lord jesus christ with all confidence no man forbidding him
paul a servant of jesus christ called to be an apostle separated unto the gospel of god
which he had promised afore by his prophets in the holy scriptures
concerning his son jesus christ our lord which was made of the seed of david according to the flesh
and declared to be the son of god with power according to the spirit of holiness by the resurrection from the dead
by whom we have received grace and apostleship for obedience to the faith among all nations for his name
among whom are ye also the called of jesus christ
to all that be in rome beloved of god called to be saints grace to you and peace from god our father and the lord jesus christ
first i thank my god through jesus christ for you all that your faith is spoken of throughout the whole world
for god is my witness whom i serve with my spirit in the gospel of his son that without ceasing i make mention of you always in my prayers
making request if by any means now at length i might have a prosperous journey by the will of god to come unto you
for i long to see you that i may impart unto you some spiritual gift to the end ye may be established
that is that i may be comforted together with you by the mutual faith both of you and me
now i would not have you ignorant brethren that oftentimes i purposed to come unto you but was let hitherto that i might have some fruit among you also even as among other gentiles
i am debtor both to the greeks and to the barbarians both to the wise and to the unwise
so as much as in me is i am ready to preach the gospel to you that are at rome also
for i am not ashamed of the gospel of christ for it is the power of god unto salvation to every one that believeth to the jew first and also to the greek
for therein is the righteousness of god revealed from faith to faith as it is written the just shall live by faith
for the wrath of god is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men who hold the truth in unrighteousness
because that which may be known of god is manifest in them for god hath shewed it unto them
for the invisible things of him from the creation of the world are clearly seen being understood by the things that are made even his eternal power and godhead so that they are without excuse
because that when they knew god they glorified him not as god neither were thankful but became vain in their imaginations and their foolish heart was darkened
professing themselves to be wise they became fools
and changed the glory of the uncorruptible god into an image made like to corruptible man and to birds and fourfooted beasts and creeping things
wherefore god also gave them up to uncleanness through the lusts of their own hearts to dishonour their own bodies between themselves
who changed the truth of god into a lie and worshipped and served the creature more than the creator who is blessed for ever amen
for this cause god gave them up unto vile affections for even their women did change the natural use into that which is against nature
and likewise also the men leaving the natural use of the woman burned in their lust one toward another men with men working that which is unseemly and receiving in themselves that recompence of their error which was meet
and even as they did not like to retain god in their knowledge god gave them over to a reprobate mind to do those things which are not convenient
being filled with all unrighteousness fornication wickedness covetousness maliciousness full of envy murder debate deceit malignity whisperers
backbiters haters of god despiteful proud boasters inventors of evil things disobedient to parents
without understanding covenantbreakers without natural affection implacable unmerciful
who knowing the judgment of god that they which commit such things are worthy of death not only do the same but have pleasure in them that do them
therefore thou art inexcusable o man whosoever thou art that judgest for wherein thou judgest another thou condemnest thyself for thou that judgest doest the same things
but we are sure that the judgment of god is according to truth against them which commit such things
and thinkest thou this o man that judgest them which do such things and doest the same that thou shalt escape the judgment of god
or despisest thou the riches of his goodness and forbearance and longsuffering not knowing that the goodness of god leadeth thee to repentance
but after thy hardness and impenitent heart treasurest up unto thyself wrath against the day of wrath and revelation of the righteous judgment of god
who will render to every man according to his deeds
to them who by patient continuance in well doing seek for glory and honour and immortality eternal life
but unto them that are contentious and do not obey the truth but obey unrighteousness indignation and wrath
tribulation and anguish upon every soul of man that doeth evil of the jew first and also of the gentile
but glory honour and peace to every man that worketh good to the jew first and also to the gentile
for there is no respect of persons with god
for as many as have sinned without law shall also perish without law and as many as have sinned in the law shall be judged by the law
for not the hearers of the law are just before god but the doers of the law shall be justified
for when the gentiles which have not the law do by nature the things contained in the law these having not the law are a law unto themselves
which shew the work of the law written in their hearts their conscience also bearing witness and their thoughts the mean while accusing or else excusing one another
in the day when god shall judge the secrets of men by jesus christ according to my gospel
behold thou art called a jew and restest in the law and makest thy boast of god
and knowest his will and approvest the things that are more excellent being instructed out of the law
and art confident that thou thyself art a guide of the blind a light of them which are in darkness
an instructor of the foolish a teacher of babes which hast the form of knowledge and of the truth in the law
thou therefore which teachest another teachest thou not thyself thou that preachest a man should not steal dost thou steal
thou that sayest a man should not commit adultery dost thou commit adultery thou that abhorrest idols dost thou commit sacrilege
thou that makest thy boast of the law through breaking the law dishonourest thou god
for the name of god is blasphemed among the gentiles through you as it is written
for circumcision verily profiteth if thou keep the law but if thou be a breaker of the law thy circumcision is made uncircumcision
therefore if the uncircumcision keep the righteousness of the law shall not his uncircumcision be counted for circumcision
and shall not uncircumcision which is by nature if it fulfil the law judge thee who by the letter and circumcision dost transgress the law
for he is not a jew which is one outwardly neither is that circumcision which is outward in the flesh
but he is a jew which is one inwardly and circumcision is that of the heart in the spirit and not in the letter whose praise is not of men but of god
what advantage then hath the jew or what profit is there of circumcision
much every way chiefly because that unto them were committed the oracles of god
for what if some did not believe shall their unbelief make the faith of god without effect
god forbid yea let god be true but every man a liar as it is written that thou mightest be justified in thy sayings and mightest overcome when thou art judged
but if our unrighteousness commend the righteousness of god what shall we say is god unrighteous who taketh vengeance i speak as a man
god forbid for then how shall god judge the world
