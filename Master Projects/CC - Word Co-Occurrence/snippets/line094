and they that shall be of thee shall build the old waste places thou shalt raise up the foundations of many generations and thou shalt be called the repairer of the breach the restorer of paths to dwell in
if thou turn away thy foot from the sabbath from doing thy pleasure on my holy day and call the sabbath a delight the holy of the lord honourable and shalt honour him not doing thine own ways nor finding thine own pleasure nor speaking thine own words
then shalt thou delight thyself in the lord and i will cause thee to ride upon the high places of the earth and feed thee with the heritage of jacob thy father for the mouth of the lord hath spoken it
behold the lord's hand is not shortened that it cannot save neither his ear heavy that it cannot hear
but your iniquities have separated between you and your god and your sins have hid his face from you that he will not hear
for your hands are defiled with blood and your fingers with iniquity your lips have spoken lies your tongue hath muttered perverseness
none calleth for justice nor any pleadeth for truth they trust in vanity and speak lies they conceive mischief and bring forth iniquity
they hatch cockatrice eggs and weave the spider's web he that eateth of their eggs dieth and that which is crushed breaketh out into a viper
their webs shall not become garments neither shall they cover themselves with their works their works are works of iniquity and the act of violence is in their hands
their feet run to evil and they make haste to shed innocent blood their thoughts are thoughts of iniquity wasting and destruction are in their paths
the way of peace they know not and there is no judgment in their goings they have made them crooked paths whosoever goeth therein shall not know peace
therefore is judgment far from us neither doth justice overtake us we wait for light but behold obscurity for brightness but we walk in darkness
we grope for the wall like the blind and we grope as if we had no eyes we stumble at noon day as in the night we are in desolate places as dead men
we roar all like bears and mourn sore like doves we look for judgment but there is none for salvation but it is far off from us
for our transgressions are multiplied before thee and our sins testify against us for our transgressions are with us and as for our iniquities we know them
in transgressing and lying against the lord and departing away from our god speaking oppression and revolt conceiving and uttering from the heart words of falsehood
and judgment is turned away backward and justice standeth afar off for truth is fallen in the street and equity cannot enter
yea truth faileth and he that departeth from evil maketh himself a prey and the lord saw it and it displeased him that there was no judgment
and he saw that there was no man and wondered that there was no intercessor therefore his arm brought salvation unto him and his righteousness it sustained him
for he put on righteousness as a breastplate and an helmet of salvation upon his head and he put on the garments of vengeance for clothing and was clad with zeal as a cloak
according to their deeds accordingly he will repay fury to his adversaries recompence to his enemies to the islands he will repay recompence
so shall they fear the name of the lord from the west and his glory from the rising of the sun when the enemy shall come in like a flood the spirit of the lord shall lift up a standard against him
and the redeemer shall come to zion and unto them that turn from transgression in jacob saith the lord
as for me this is my covenant with them saith the lord my spirit that is upon thee and my words which i have put in thy mouth shall not depart out of thy mouth nor out of the mouth of thy seed nor out of the mouth of thy seed's seed saith the lord from henceforth and for ever
arise shine for thy light is come and the glory of the lord is risen upon thee
for behold the darkness shall cover the earth and gross darkness the people but the lord shall arise upon thee and his glory shall be seen upon thee
and the gentiles shall come to thy light and kings to the brightness of thy rising
lift up thine eyes round about and see all they gather themselves together they come to thee thy sons shall come from far and thy daughters shall be nursed at thy side
then thou shalt see and flow together and thine heart shall fear and be enlarged because the abundance of the sea shall be converted unto thee the forces of the gentiles shall come unto thee
the multitude of camels shall cover thee the dromedaries of midian and ephah all they from sheba shall come they shall bring gold and incense and they shall shew forth the praises of the lord
all the flocks of kedar shall be gathered together unto thee the rams of nebaioth shall minister unto thee they shall come up with acceptance on mine altar and i will glorify the house of my glory
who are these that fly as a cloud and as the doves to their windows
surely the isles shall wait for me and the ships of tarshish first to bring thy sons from far their silver and their gold with them unto the name of the lord thy god and to the holy one of israel because he hath glorified thee
and the sons of strangers shall build up thy walls and their kings shall minister unto thee for in my wrath i smote thee but in my favour have i had mercy on thee
therefore thy gates shall be open continually they shall not be shut day nor night that men may bring unto thee the forces of the gentiles and that their kings may be brought
for the nation and kingdom that will not serve thee shall perish yea those nations shall be utterly wasted
the glory of lebanon shall come unto thee the fir tree the pine tree and the box together to beautify the place of my sanctuary and i will make the place of my feet glorious
the sons also of them that afflicted thee shall come bending unto thee and all they that despised thee shall bow themselves down at the soles of thy feet and they shall call thee the city of the lord the zion of the holy one of israel
whereas thou hast been forsaken and hated so that no man went through thee i will make thee an eternal excellency a joy of many generations
thou shalt also suck the milk of the gentiles and shalt suck the breast of kings and thou shalt know that i the lord am thy saviour and thy redeemer the mighty one of jacob
for brass i will bring gold and for iron i will bring silver and for wood brass and for stones iron i will also make thy officers peace and thine exactors righteousness
violence shall no more be heard in thy land wasting nor destruction within thy borders but thou shalt call thy walls salvation and thy gates praise
the sun shall be no more thy light by day neither for brightness shall the moon give light unto thee but the lord shall be unto thee an everlasting light and thy god thy glory
thy sun shall no more go down neither shall thy moon withdraw itself for the lord shall be thine everlasting light and the days of thy mourning shall be ended
thy people also shall be all righteous they shall inherit the land for ever the branch of my planting the work of my hands that i may be glorified
a little one shall become a thousand and a small one a strong nation i the lord will hasten it in his time
the spirit of the lord god is upon me because the lord hath anointed me to preach good tidings unto the meek he hath sent me to bind up the brokenhearted to proclaim liberty to the captives and the opening of the prison to them that are bound
to proclaim the acceptable year of the lord and the day of vengeance of our god to comfort all that mourn
to appoint unto them that mourn in zion to give unto them beauty for ashes the oil of joy for mourning the garment of praise for the spirit of heaviness that they might be called trees of righteousness the planting of the lord that he might be glorified
and they shall build the old wastes they shall raise up the former desolations and they shall repair the waste cities the desolations of many generations
and strangers shall stand and feed your flocks and the sons of the alien shall be your plowmen and your vinedressers
but ye shall be named the priests of the lord men shall call you the ministers of our god ye shall eat the riches of the gentiles and in their glory shall ye boast yourselves
for your shame ye shall have double and for confusion they shall rejoice in their portion therefore in their land they shall possess the double everlasting joy shall be unto them
for i the lord love judgment i hate robbery for burnt offering and i will direct their work in truth and i will make an everlasting covenant with them
and their seed shall be known among the gentiles and their offspring among the people all that see them shall acknowledge them that they are the seed which the lord hath blessed
i will greatly rejoice in the lord my soul shall be joyful in my god for he hath clothed me with the garments of salvation he hath covered me with the robe of righteousness as a bridegroom decketh himself with ornaments and as a bride adorneth herself with her jewels
for as the earth bringeth forth her bud and as the garden causeth the things that are sown in it to spring forth so the lord god will cause righteousness and praise to spring forth before all the nations
for zion's sake will i not hold my peace and for jerusalem's sake i will not rest until the righteousness thereof go forth as brightness and the salvation thereof as a lamp that burneth
and the gentiles shall see thy righteousness and all kings thy glory and thou shalt be called by a new name which the mouth of the lord shall name
thou shalt also be a crown of glory in the hand of the lord and a royal diadem in the hand of thy god
thou shalt no more be termed forsaken neither shall thy land any more be termed desolate but thou shalt be called hephzibah and thy land beulah for the lord delighteth in thee and thy land shall be married
for as a young man marrieth a virgin so shall thy sons marry thee and as the bridegroom rejoiceth over the bride so shall thy god rejoice over thee
i have set watchmen upon thy walls o jerusalem which shall never hold their peace day nor night ye that make mention of the lord keep not silence
and give him no rest till he establish and till he make jerusalem a praise in the earth
the lord hath sworn by his right hand and by the arm of his strength surely i will no more give thy corn to be meat for thine enemies and the sons of the stranger shall not drink thy wine for the which thou hast laboured
but they that have gathered it shall eat it and praise the lord and they that have brought it together shall drink it in the courts of my holiness
go through go through the gates prepare ye the way of the people cast up cast up the highway gather out the stones lift up a standard for the people
behold the lord hath proclaimed unto the end of the world say ye to the daughter of zion behold thy salvation cometh behold his reward is with him and his work before him
and they shall call them the holy people the redeemed of the lord and thou shalt be called sought out a city not forsaken
who is this that cometh from edom with dyed garments from bozrah this that is glorious in his apparel travelling in the greatness of his strength i that speak in righteousness mighty to save
wherefore art thou red in thine apparel and thy garments like him that treadeth in the winefat
i have trodden the winepress alone and of the people there was none with me for i will tread them in mine anger and trample them in my fury and their blood shall be sprinkled upon my garments and i will stain all my raiment
for the day of vengeance is in mine heart and the year of my redeemed is come
and i looked and there was none to help and i wondered that there was none to uphold therefore mine own arm brought salvation unto me and my fury it upheld me
and i will tread down the people in mine anger and make them drunk in my fury and i will bring down their strength to the earth
i will mention the lovingkindnesses of the lord and the praises of the lord according to all that the lord hath bestowed on us and the great goodness toward the house of israel which he hath bestowed on them according to his mercies and according to the multitude of his lovingkindnesses
for he said surely they are my people children that will not lie so he was their saviour
in all their affliction he was afflicted and the angel of his presence saved them in his love and in his pity he redeemed them and he bare them and carried them all the days of old
but they rebelled and vexed his holy spirit therefore he was turned to be their enemy and he fought against them
then he remembered the days of old moses and his people saying where is he that brought them up out of the sea with the shepherd of his flock where is he that put his holy spirit within him
that led them by the right hand of moses with his glorious arm dividing the water before them to make himself an everlasting name
that led them through the deep as an horse in the wilderness that they should not stumble
as a beast goeth down into the valley the spirit of the lord caused him to rest so didst thou lead thy people to make thyself a glorious name
look down from heaven and behold from the habitation of thy holiness and of thy glory where is thy zeal and thy strength the sounding of thy bowels and of thy mercies toward me are they restrained
doubtless thou art our father though abraham be ignorant of us and israel acknowledge us not thou o lord art our father our redeemer thy name is from everlasting
o lord why hast thou made us to err from thy ways and hardened our heart from thy fear return for thy servants sake the tribes of thine inheritance
the people of thy holiness have possessed it but a little while our adversaries have trodden down thy sanctuary
we are thine thou never barest rule over them they were not called by thy name
oh that thou wouldest rend the heavens that thou wouldest come down that the mountains might flow down at thy presence
as when the melting fire burneth the fire causeth the waters to boil to make thy name known to thine adversaries that the nations may tremble at thy presence
when thou didst terrible things which we looked not for thou camest down the mountains flowed down at thy presence
for since the beginning of the world men have not heard nor perceived by the ear neither hath the eye seen o god beside thee what he hath prepared for him that waiteth for him
thou meetest him that rejoiceth and worketh righteousness those that remember thee in thy ways behold thou art wroth for we have sinned in those is continuance and we shall be saved
but we are all as an unclean thing and all our righteousnesses are as filthy rags and we all do fade as a leaf and our iniquities like the wind have taken us away
and there is none that calleth upon thy name that stirreth up himself to take hold of thee for thou hast hid thy face from us and hast consumed us because of our iniquities
but now o lord thou art our father we are the clay and thou our potter and we all are the work of thy hand
be not wroth very sore o lord neither remember iniquity for ever behold see we beseech thee we are all thy people
thy holy cities are a wilderness zion is a wilderness jerusalem a desolation
our holy and our beautiful house where our fathers praised thee is burned up with fire and all our pleasant things are laid waste
wilt thou refrain thyself for these things o lord wilt thou hold thy peace and afflict us very sore
i am sought of them that asked not for me i am found of them that sought me not i said behold me behold me unto a nation that was not called by my name
i have spread out my hands all the day unto a rebellious people which walketh in a way that was not good after their own thoughts
a people that provoketh me to anger continually to my face that sacrificeth in gardens and burneth incense upon altars of brick
which remain among the graves and lodge in the monuments which eat swine's flesh and broth of abominable things is in their vessels
which say stand by thyself come not near to me for i am holier than thou these are a smoke in my nose a fire that burneth all the day
behold it is written before me i will not keep silence but will recompense even recompense into their bosom
your iniquities and the iniquities of your fathers together saith the lord which have burned incense upon the mountains and blasphemed me upon the hills therefore will i measure their former work into their bosom
thus saith the lord as the new wine is found in the cluster and one saith destroy it not for a blessing is in it so will i do for my servants sakes that i may not destroy them all
and i will bring forth a seed out of jacob and out of judah an inheritor of my mountains and mine elect shall inherit it and my servants shall dwell there
and sharon shall be a fold of flocks and the valley of achor a place for the herds to lie down in for my people that have sought me
but ye are they that forsake the lord that forget my holy mountain that prepare a table for that troop and that furnish the drink offering unto that number
therefore will i number you to the sword and ye shall all bow down to the slaughter because when i called ye did not answer when i spake ye did not hear but did evil before mine eyes and did choose that wherein i delighted not
therefore thus saith the lord god behold my servants shall eat but ye shall be hungry behold my servants shall drink but ye shall be thirsty behold my servants shall rejoice but ye shall be ashamed
behold my servants shall sing for joy of heart but ye shall cry for sorrow of heart and shall howl for vexation of spirit
and ye shall leave your name for a curse unto my chosen for the lord god shall slay thee and call his servants by another name
that he who blesseth himself in the earth shall bless himself in the god of truth and he that sweareth in the earth shall swear by the god of truth because the former troubles are forgotten and because they are hid from mine eyes
for behold i create new heavens and a new earth and the former shall not be remembered nor come into mind
but be ye glad and rejoice for ever in that which i create for behold i create jerusalem a rejoicing and her people a joy
and i will rejoice in jerusalem and joy in my people and the voice of weeping shall be no more heard in her nor the voice of crying
there shall be no more thence an infant of days nor an old man that hath not filled his days for the child shall die an hundred years old but the sinner being an hundred years old shall be accursed
and they shall build houses and inhabit them and they shall plant vineyards and eat the fruit of them
they shall not build and another inhabit they shall not plant and another eat for as the days of a tree are the days of my people and mine elect shall long enjoy the work of their hands
they shall not labour in vain nor bring forth for trouble for they are the seed of the blessed of the lord and their offspring with them
and it shall come to pass that before they call i will answer and while they are yet speaking i will hear
the wolf and the lamb shall feed together and the lion shall eat straw like the bullock and dust shall be the serpent's meat they shall not hurt nor destroy in all my holy mountain saith the lord
thus saith the lord the heaven is my throne and the earth is my footstool where is the house that ye build unto me and where is the place of my rest
for all those things hath mine hand made and all those things have been saith the lord but to this man will i look even to him that is poor and of a contrite spirit and trembleth at my word
he that killeth an ox is as if he slew a man he that sacrificeth a lamb as if he cut off a dog's neck he that offereth an oblation as if he offered swine's blood he that burneth incense as if he blessed an idol yea they have chosen their own ways and their soul delighteth in their abominations
i also will choose their delusions and will bring their fears upon them because when i called none did answer when i spake they did not hear but they did evil before mine eyes and chose that in which i delighted not
hear the word of the lord ye that tremble at his word your brethren that hated you that cast you out for my name's sake said let the lord be glorified but he shall appear to your joy and they shall be ashamed
a voice of noise from the city a voice from the temple a voice of the lord that rendereth recompence to his enemies
before she travailed she brought forth before her pain came she was delivered of a man child
who hath heard such a thing who hath seen such things shall the earth be made to bring forth in one day or shall a nation be born at once for as soon as zion travailed she brought forth her children
shall i bring to the birth and not cause to bring forth saith the lord shall i cause to bring forth and shut the womb saith thy god
rejoice ye with jerusalem and be glad with her all ye that love her rejoice for joy with her all ye that mourn for her
that ye may suck and be satisfied with the breasts of her consolations that ye may milk out and be delighted with the abundance of her glory
for thus saith the lord behold i will extend peace to her like a river and the glory of the gentiles like a flowing stream then shall ye suck ye shall be borne upon her sides and be dandled upon her knees
as one whom his mother comforteth so will i comfort you and ye shall be comforted in jerusalem
and when ye see this your heart shall rejoice and your bones shall flourish like an herb and the hand of the lord shall be known toward his servants and his indignation toward his enemies
for behold the lord will come with fire and with his chariots like a whirlwind to render his anger with fury and his rebuke with flames of fire
for by fire and by his sword will the lord plead with all flesh and the slain of the lord shall be many
they that sanctify themselves and purify themselves in the gardens behind one tree in the midst eating swine's flesh and the abomination and the mouse shall be consumed together saith the lord
for i know their works and their thoughts it shall come that i will gather all nations and tongues and they shall come and see my glory
and i will set a sign among them and i will send those that escape of them unto the nations to tarshish pul and lud that draw the bow to tubal and javan to the isles afar off that have not heard my fame neither have seen my glory and they shall declare my glory among the gentiles
and they shall bring all your brethren for an offering unto the lord out of all nations upon horses and in chariots and in litters and upon mules and upon swift beasts to my holy mountain jerusalem saith the lord as the children of israel bring an offering in a clean vessel into the house of the lord
and i will also take of them for priests and for levites saith the lord
for as the new heavens and the new earth which i will make shall remain before me saith the lord so shall your seed and your name remain
and it shall come to pass that from one new moon to another and from one sabbath to another shall all flesh come to worship before me saith the lord
and they shall go forth and look upon the carcases of the men that have transgressed against me for their worm shall not die neither shall their fire be quenched and they shall be an abhorring unto all flesh
the words of jeremiah the son of hilkiah of the priests that were in anathoth in the land of benjamin
to whom the word of the lord came in the days of josiah the son of amon king of judah in the thirteenth year of his reign
it came also in the days of jehoiakim the son of josiah king of judah unto the end of the eleventh year of zedekiah the son of josiah king of judah unto the carrying away of jerusalem captive in the fifth month
then the word of the lord came unto me saying
before i formed thee in the belly i knew thee and before thou camest forth out of the womb i sanctified thee and i ordained thee a prophet unto the nations
then said i ah lord god behold i cannot speak for i am a child
but the lord said unto me say not i am a child for thou shalt go to all that i shall send thee and whatsoever i command thee thou shalt speak
be not afraid of their faces for i am with thee to deliver thee saith the lord
then the lord put forth his hand and touched my mouth and the lord said unto me behold i have put my words in thy mouth
see i have this day set thee over the nations and over the kingdoms to root out and to pull down and to destroy and to throw down to build and to plant
moreover the word of the lord came unto me saying jeremiah what seest thou and i said i see a rod of an almond tree
then said the lord unto me thou hast well seen for i will hasten my word to perform it
and the word of the lord came unto me the second time saying what seest thou and i said i see a seething pot and the face thereof is toward the north
then the lord said unto me out of the north an evil shall break forth upon all the inhabitants of the land
for lo i will call all the families of the kingdoms of the north saith the lord and they shall come and they shall set every one his throne at the entering of the gates of jerusalem and against all the walls thereof round about and against all the cities of judah
and i will utter my judgments against them touching all their wickedness who have forsaken me and have burned incense unto other gods and worshipped the works of their own hands
thou therefore gird up thy loins and arise and speak unto them all that i command thee be not dismayed at their faces lest i confound thee before them
for behold i have made thee this day a defenced city and an iron pillar and brasen walls against the whole land against the kings of judah against the princes thereof against the priests thereof and against the people of the land
and they shall fight against thee but they shall not prevail against thee for i am with thee saith the lord to deliver thee
moreover the word of the lord came to me saying
go and cry in the ears of jerusalem saying thus saith the lord i remember thee the kindness of thy youth the love of thine espousals when thou wentest after me in the wilderness in a land that was not sown
israel was holiness unto the lord and the firstfruits of his increase all that devour him shall offend evil shall come upon them saith the lord
hear ye the word of the lord o house of jacob and all the families of the house of israel
thus saith the lord what iniquity have your fathers found in me that they are gone far from me and have walked after vanity and are become vain
neither said they where is the lord that brought us up out of the land of egypt that led us through the wilderness through a land of deserts and of pits through a land of drought and of the shadow of death through a land that no man passed through and where no man dwelt
and i brought you into a plentiful country to eat the fruit thereof and the goodness thereof but when ye entered ye defiled my land and made mine heritage an abomination
the priests said not where is the lord and they that handle the law knew me not the pastors also transgressed against me and the prophets prophesied by baal and walked after things that do not profit
wherefore i will yet plead with you saith the lord and with your children's children will i plead
for pass over the isles of chittim and see and send unto kedar and consider diligently and see if there be such a thing
hath a nation changed their gods which are yet no gods but my people have changed their glory for that which doth not profit
be astonished o ye heavens at this and be horribly afraid be ye very desolate saith the lord
for my people have committed two evils they have forsaken me the fountain of living waters and hewed them out cisterns broken cisterns that can hold no water
is israel a servant is he a homeborn slave why is he spoiled
the young lions roared upon him and yelled and they made his land waste his cities are burned without inhabitant
also the children of noph and tahapanes have broken the crown of thy head
hast thou not procured this unto thyself in that thou hast forsaken the lord thy god when he led thee by the way
and now what hast thou to do in the way of egypt to drink the waters of sihor or what hast thou to do in the way of assyria to drink the waters of the river
thine own wickedness shall correct thee and thy backslidings shall reprove thee know therefore and see that it is an evil thing and bitter that thou hast forsaken the lord thy god and that my fear is not in thee saith the lord god of hosts
for of old time i have broken thy yoke and burst thy bands and thou saidst i will not transgress when upon every high hill and under every green tree thou wanderest playing the harlot
yet i had planted thee a noble vine wholly a right seed how then art thou turned into the degenerate plant of a strange vine unto me
for though thou wash thee with nitre and take thee much soap yet thine iniquity is marked before me saith the lord god
how canst thou say i am not polluted i have not gone after baalim see thy way in the valley know what thou hast done thou art a swift dromedary traversing her ways
a wild ass used to the wilderness that snuffeth up the wind at her pleasure in her occasion who can turn her away all they that seek her will not weary themselves in her month they shall find her
withhold thy foot from being unshod and thy throat from thirst but thou saidst there is no hope no for i have loved strangers and after them will i go
as the thief is ashamed when he is found so is the house of israel ashamed they their kings their princes and their priests and their prophets
saying to a stock thou art my father and to a stone thou hast brought me forth for they have turned their back unto me and not their face but in the time of their trouble they will say arise and save us
but where are thy gods that thou hast made thee let them arise if they can save thee in the time of thy trouble for according to the number of thy cities are thy gods o judah
wherefore will ye plead with me ye all have transgressed against me saith the lord
in vain have i smitten your children they received no correction your own sword hath devoured your prophets like a destroying lion
o generation see ye the word of the lord have i been a wilderness unto israel a land of darkness wherefore say my people we are lords we will come no more unto thee
can a maid forget her ornaments or a bride her attire yet my people have forgotten me days without number
