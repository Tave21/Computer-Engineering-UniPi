thy word have i hid in mine heart that i might not sin against thee
blessed art thou o lord teach me thy statutes
with my lips have i declared all the judgments of thy mouth
i have rejoiced in the way of thy testimonies as much as in all riches
i will meditate in thy precepts and have respect unto thy ways
i will delight myself in thy statutes i will not forget thy word
deal bountifully with thy servant that i may live and keep thy word
open thou mine eyes that i may behold wondrous things out of thy law
i am a stranger in the earth hide not thy commandments from me
my soul breaketh for the longing that it hath unto thy judgments at all times
thou hast rebuked the proud that are cursed which do err from thy commandments
remove from me reproach and contempt for i have kept thy testimonies
princes also did sit and speak against me but thy servant did meditate in thy statutes
thy testimonies also are my delight and my counsellors
my soul cleaveth unto the dust quicken thou me according to thy word
i have declared my ways and thou heardest me teach me thy statutes
make me to understand the way of thy precepts so shall i talk of thy wondrous works
my soul melteth for heaviness strengthen thou me according unto thy word
remove from me the way of lying and grant me thy law graciously
i have chosen the way of truth thy judgments have i laid before me
i have stuck unto thy testimonies o lord put me not to shame
i will run the way of thy commandments when thou shalt enlarge my heart
teach me o lord the way of thy statutes and i shall keep it unto the end
give me understanding and i shall keep thy law yea i shall observe it with my whole heart
make me to go in the path of thy commandments for therein do i delight
incline my heart unto thy testimonies and not to covetousness

and i will delight myself in thy commandments which i have loved
my hands also will i lift up unto thy commandments which i have loved and i will meditate in thy statutes
remember the word unto thy servant upon which thou hast caused me to hope
this is my comfort in my affliction for thy word hath quickened me
the proud have had me greatly in derision yet have i not declined from thy law
i remembered thy judgments of old o lord and have comforted myself
horror hath taken hold upon me because of the wicked that forsake thy law
thy statutes have been my songs in the house of my pilgrimage
i have remembered thy name o lord in the night and have kept thy law
this i had because i kept thy precepts
thou art my portion o lord i have said that i would keep thy words
i intreated thy favour with my whole heart be merciful unto me according to thy word
i thought on my ways and turned my feet unto thy testimonies
i made haste and delayed not to keep thy commandments
the bands of the wicked have robbed me but i have not forgotten thy law
at midnight i will rise to give thanks unto thee because of thy righteous judgments
i am a companion of all them that fear thee and of them that keep thy precepts
the earth o lord is full of thy mercy teach me thy statutes
thou hast dealt well with thy servant o lord according unto thy word
teach me good judgment and knowledge for i have believed thy commandments
before i was afflicted i went astray but now have i kept thy word
thou art good and doest good teach me thy statutes
the proud have forged a lie against me but i will keep thy precepts with my whole heart
their heart is as fat as grease but i delight in thy law
it is good for me that i have been afflicted that i might learn thy statutes
the law of thy mouth is better unto me than thousands of gold and silver
thy hands have made me and fashioned me give me understanding that i may learn thy commandments
they that fear thee will be glad when they see me because i have hoped in thy word
i know o lord that thy judgments are right and that thou in faithfulness hast afflicted me
let i pray thee thy merciful kindness be for my comfort according to thy word unto thy servant
let thy tender mercies come unto me that i may live for thy law is my delight
let the proud be ashamed for they dealt perversely with me without a cause but i will meditate in thy precepts
let those that fear thee turn unto me and those that have known thy testimonies
let my heart be sound in thy statutes that i be not ashamed
my soul fainteth for thy salvation but i hope in thy word
mine eyes fail for thy word saying when wilt thou comfort me
for i am become like a bottle in the smoke yet do i not forget thy statutes
how many are the days of thy servant when wilt thou execute judgment on them that persecute me
the proud have digged pits for me which are not after thy law
all thy commandments are faithful they persecute me wrongfully help thou me
they had almost consumed me upon earth but i forsook not thy precepts
quicken me after thy lovingkindness so shall i keep the testimony of thy mouth
for ever o lord thy word is settled in heaven
thy faithfulness is unto all generations thou hast established the earth and it abideth
they continue this day according to thine ordinances for all are thy servants
unless thy law had been my delights i should then have perished in mine affliction
i will never forget thy precepts for with them thou hast quickened me
i am thine save me for i have sought thy precepts
the wicked have waited for me to destroy me but i will consider thy testimonies
i have seen an end of all perfection but thy commandment is exceeding broad
o how love i thy law it is my meditation all the day
thou through thy commandments hast made me wiser than mine enemies for they are ever with me
i have more understanding than all my teachers for thy testimonies are my meditation
