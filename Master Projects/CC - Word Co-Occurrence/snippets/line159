 to say as i said then but come away
 get me ink and paper
 he shall have every day a several greeting
 or i'll unpeople egypt
 exeunt
 antony and cleopatra
act ii
scene i messina pompey's house
 enter pompey menecrates and menas in
 warlike manner
pompey if the great gods be just they shall assist
 the deeds of justest men
menecrates know worthy pompey
 that what they do delay they not deny
pompey whiles we are suitors to their throne decays
 the thing we sue for
menecrates we ignorant of ourselves
 beg often our own harms which the wise powers
 deny us for our good so find we profit
 by losing of our prayers
pompey i shall do well
 the people love me and the sea is mine
 my powers are crescent and my auguring hope
 says it will come to the full mark antony
 in egypt sits at dinner and will make
 no wars without doors caesar gets money where
 he loses hearts lepidus flatters both
 of both is flatter'd but he neither loves
 nor either cares for him
menas caesar and lepidus
 are in the field a mighty strength they carry
pompey where have you this tis false
menas from silvius sir
pompey he dreams i know they are in rome together
 looking for antony but all the charms of love
 salt cleopatra soften thy waned lip
 let witchcraft join with beauty lust with both
 tie up the libertine in a field of feasts
 keep his brain fuming epicurean cooks
 sharpen with cloyless sauce his appetite
 that sleep and feeding may prorogue his honour
 even till a lethe'd dulness
 enter varrius
 how now varrius
varrius this is most certain that i shall deliver
 mark antony is every hour in rome
 expected since he went from egypt tis
 a space for further travel
pompey i could have given less matter
 a better ear menas i did not think
 this amorous surfeiter would have donn'd his helm
 for such a petty war his soldiership
 is twice the other twain but let us rear
 the higher our opinion that our stirring
 can from the lap of egypt's widow pluck
 the ne'erlustwearied antony
menas i cannot hope
 caesar and antony shall well greet together
 his wife that's dead did trespasses to caesar
 his brother warr'd upon him although i think
 not moved by antony
pompey i know not menas
 how lesser enmities may give way to greater
 were't not that we stand up against them all
 twere pregnant they should square between
 themselves
 for they have entertained cause enough
 to draw their swords but how the fear of us
 may cement their divisions and bind up
 the petty difference we yet not know
 be't as our gods will have't it only stands
 our lives upon to use our strongest hands
 come menas
 exeunt
 antony and cleopatra
act ii
scene ii rome the house of lepidus
 enter domitius enobarbus and lepidus
lepidus good enobarbus tis a worthy deed
 and shall become you well to entreat your captain
 to soft and gentle speech
domitius enobarbus i shall entreat him
 to answer like himself if caesar move him
 let antony look over caesar's head
 and speak as loud as mars by jupiter
 were i the wearer of antonius beard
 i would not shave't today
lepidus tis not a time
 for private stomaching
domitius enobarbus every time
 serves for the matter that is then born in't
lepidus but small to greater matters must give way
domitius enobarbus not if the small come first
lepidus your speech is passion
 but pray you stir no embers up here comes
 the noble antony
 enter mark antony and ventidius
domitius enobarbus and yonder caesar
 enter octavius caesar mecaenas and agrippa
mark antony if we compose well here to parthia
 hark ventidius
octavius caesar i do not know
 mecaenas ask agrippa
lepidus noble friends
 that which combined us was most great and let not
 a leaner action rend us what's amiss
 may it be gently heard when we debate
 our trivial difference loud we do commit
 murder in healing wounds then noble partners
 the rather for i earnestly beseech
 touch you the sourest points with sweetest terms
 nor curstness grow to the matter
mark antony tis spoken well
 were we before our armies and to fight
 i should do thus
 flourish
octavius caesar welcome to rome
mark antony thank you
octavius caesar sit
mark antony sit sir
octavius caesar nay then
mark antony i learn you take things ill which are not so
 or being concern you not
octavius caesar i must be laugh'd at
 if or for nothing or a little i
 should say myself offended and with you
 chiefly i the world more laugh'd at that i should
 once name you derogately when to sound your name
 it not concern'd me
mark antony my being in egypt caesar
 what was't to you
octavius caesar no more than my residing here at rome
 might be to you in egypt yet if you there
 did practise on my state your being in egypt
 might be my question
mark antony how intend you practised
octavius caesar you may be pleased to catch at mine intent
 by what did here befal me your wife and brother
 made wars upon me and their contestation
 was theme for you you were the word of war
mark antony you do mistake your business my brother never
 did urge me in his act i did inquire it
 and have my learning from some true reports
 that drew their swords with you did he not rather
 discredit my authority with yours
 and make the wars alike against my stomach
 having alike your cause of this my letters
 before did satisfy you if you'll patch a quarrel
 as matter whole you have not to make it with
 it must not be with this
octavius caesar you praise yourself
 by laying defects of judgment to me but
 you patch'd up your excuses
mark antony not so not so
 i know you could not lack i am certain on't
 very necessity of this thought that i
 your partner in the cause gainst which he fought
 could not with graceful eyes attend those wars
 which fronted mine own peace as for my wife
 i would you had her spirit in such another
 the third o the world is yours which with a snaffle
 you may pace easy but not such a wife
domitius enobarbus would we had all such wives that the men might go
 to wars with the women
mark antony so much uncurbable her garboils caesar
 made out of her impatience which not wanted
 shrewdness of policy too i grieving grant
 did you too much disquiet for that you must
 but say i could not help it
octavius caesar i wrote to you
 when rioting in alexandria you
 did pocket up my letters and with taunts
 did gibe my missive out of audience
mark antony sir
 he fell upon me ere admitted then
 three kings i had newly feasted and did want
 of what i was i the morning but next day
 i told him of myself which was as much
 as to have ask'd him pardon let this fellow
 be nothing of our strife if we contend
 out of our question wipe him
octavius caesar you have broken
 the article of your oath which you shall never
 have tongue to charge me with
lepidus soft caesar
mark antony no
 lepidus let him speak
 the honour is sacred which he talks on now
 supposing that i lack'd it but on caesar
 the article of my oath
octavius caesar to lend me arms and aid when i required them
 the which you both denied
mark antony neglected rather
 and then when poison'd hours had bound me up
 from mine own knowledge as nearly as i may
 i'll play the penitent to you but mine honesty
 shall not make poor my greatness nor my power
 work without it truth is that fulvia
 to have me out of egypt made wars here
 for which myself the ignorant motive do
