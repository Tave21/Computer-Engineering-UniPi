 you may behold confusion of your foes
 exit
 enter vernon and basset
vernon grant me the combat gracious sovereign
basset and me my lord grant me the combat too
york this is my servant hear him noble prince
somerset and this is mine sweet henry favour him
king henry vi be patient lords and give them leave to speak
 say gentlemen what makes you thus exclaim
 and wherefore crave you combat or with whom
vernon with him my lord for he hath done me wrong
basset and i with him for he hath done me wrong
king henry vi what is that wrong whereof you both complain
 first let me know and then i'll answer you
basset crossing the sea from england into france
 this fellow here with envious carping tongue
 upbraided me about the rose i wear
 saying the sanguine colour of the leaves
 did represent my master's blushing cheeks
 when stubbornly he did repugn the truth
 about a certain question in the law
 argued betwixt the duke of york and him
 with other vile and ignominious terms
 in confutation of which rude reproach
 and in defence of my lord's worthiness
 i crave the benefit of law of arms
vernon and that is my petition noble lord
 for though he seem with forged quaint conceit
 to set a gloss upon his bold intent
 yet know my lord i was provoked by him
 and he first took exceptions at this badge
 pronouncing that the paleness of this flower
 bewray'd the faintness of my master's heart
york will not this malice somerset be left
somerset your private grudge my lord of york will out
 though ne'er so cunningly you smother it
king henry vi good lord what madness rules in brainsick men
 when for so slight and frivolous a cause
 such factious emulations shall arise
 good cousins both of york and somerset
 quiet yourselves i pray and be at peace
york let this dissension first be tried by fight
 and then your highness shall command a peace
somerset the quarrel toucheth none but us alone
 betwixt ourselves let us decide it then
york there is my pledge accept it somerset
vernon nay let it rest where it began at first
basset confirm it so mine honourable lord
gloucester confirm it so confounded be your strife
 and perish ye with your audacious prate
 presumptuous vassals are you not ashamed
 with this immodest clamorous outrage
 to trouble and disturb the king and us
 and you my lords methinks you do not well
 to bear with their perverse objections
 much less to take occasion from their mouths
 to raise a mutiny betwixt yourselves
 let me persuade you take a better course
exeter it grieves his highness good my lords be friends
king henry vi come hither you that would be combatants
 henceforth i charge you as you love our favour
 quite to forget this quarrel and the cause
 and you my lords remember where we are
 in france amongst a fickle wavering nation
 if they perceive dissension in our looks
 and that within ourselves we disagree
 how will their grudging stomachs be provoked
 to wilful disobedience and rebel
 beside what infamy will there arise
 when foreign princes shall be certified
 that for a toy a thing of no regard
 king henry's peers and chief nobility
 destroy'd themselves and lost the realm of france
 o think upon the conquest of my father
 my tender years and let us not forego
 that for a trifle that was bought with blood
 let me be umpire in this doubtful strife
 i see no reason if i wear this rose
 putting on a red rose
 that any one should therefore be suspicious
 i more incline to somerset than york
 both are my kinsmen and i love them both
 as well they may upbraid me with my crown
 because forsooth the king of scots is crown'd
 but your discretions better can persuade
 than i am able to instruct or teach
 and therefore as we hither came in peace
 so let us still continue peace and love
 cousin of york we institute your grace
 to be our regent in these parts of france
 and good my lord of somerset unite
 your troops of horsemen with his bands of foot
 and like true subjects sons of your progenitors
 go cheerfully together and digest
 your angry choler on your enemies
 ourself my lord protector and the rest
 after some respite will return to calais
 from thence to england where i hope ere long
 to be presented by your victories
 with charles alencon and that traitorous rout
 flourish exeunt all but york warwick exeter
 and vernon
warwick my lord of york i promise you the king
 prettily methought did play the orator
york and so he did but yet i like it not
 in that he wears the badge of somerset
warwick tush that was but his fancy blame him not
 i dare presume sweet prince he thought no harm
york an if i wist he didbut let it rest
 other affairs must now be managed
 exeunt all but exeter
exeter well didst thou richard to suppress thy voice
 for had the passions of thy heart burst out
 i fear we should have seen decipher'd there
 more rancorous spite more furious raging broils
 than yet can be imagined or supposed
 but howsoe'er no simple man that sees
 this jarring discord of nobility
 this shouldering of each other in the court
 this factious bandying of their favourites
 but that it doth presage some ill event
 tis much when sceptres are in children's hands
 but more when envy breeds unkind division
 there comes the rain there begins confusion

scene ii before bourdeaux
 enter talbot with trump and drum
talbot go to the gates of bourdeaux trumpeter
 summon their general unto the wall
 trumpet sounds enter general and others aloft
 english john talbot captains calls you forth
 servant in arms to harry king of england
 and thus he would open your city gates
 be humble to us call my sovereign yours
 and do him homage as obedient subjects
 and i'll withdraw me and my bloody power
 but if you frown upon this proffer'd peace
 you tempt the fury of my three attendants
 lean famine quartering steel and climbing fire
 who in a moment even with the earth
 shall lay your stately and airbraving towers
 if you forsake the offer of their love
general thou ominous and fearful owl of death
 our nation's terror and their bloody scourge
 the period of thy tyranny approacheth
 on us thou canst not enter but by death
 for i protest we are well fortified
 and strong enough to issue out and fight
 if thou retire the dauphin well appointed
 stands with the snares of war to tangle thee
 on either hand thee there are squadrons pitch'd
 to wall thee from the liberty of flight
 and no way canst thou turn thee for redress
 but death doth front thee with apparent spoil
 and pale destruction meets thee in the face
 ten thousand french have ta'en the sacrament
 to rive their dangerous artillery
 upon no christian soul but english talbot
 lo there thou stand'st a breathing valiant man
 of an invincible unconquer'd spirit
 this is the latest glory of thy praise
 that i thy enemy due thee withal
 for ere the glass that now begins to run
 finish the process of his sandy hour
 these eyes that see thee now well coloured
 shall see thee wither'd bloody pale and dead
 drum afar off
 hark hark the dauphin's drum a warning bell
 sings heavy music to thy timorous soul
 and mine shall ring thy dire departure out
 exeunt general &c
talbot he fables not i hear the enemy
 out some light horsemen and peruse their wings
 o negligent and heedless discipline
 how are we park'd and bounded in a pale
 a little herd of england's timorous deer
 mazed with a yelping kennel of french curs
 if we be english deer be then in blood
 not rascallike to fall down with a pinch
 but rather moodymad and desperate stags
 turn on the bloody hounds with heads of steel
 and make the cowards stand aloof at bay
 sell every man his life as dear as mine
 and they shall find dear deer of us my friends
 god and saint george talbot and england's right
 prosper our colours in this dangerous fight
