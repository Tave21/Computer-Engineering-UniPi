 if thou darest bring them to the baiting place
richard oft have i seen a hot o'erweening cur
 run back and bite because he was withheld
 who being suffer'd with the bear's fell paw
 hath clapp'd his tail between his legs and cried
 and such a piece of service will you do
 if you oppose yourselves to match lord warwick
clifford hence heap of wrath foul indigested lump
 as crooked in thy manners as thy shape
york nay we shall heat you thoroughly anon
clifford take heed lest by your heat you burn yourselves
king henry vi why warwick hath thy knee forgot to bow
 old salisbury shame to thy silver hair
 thou mad misleader of thy brainsick son
 what wilt thou on thy deathbed play the ruffian
 and seek for sorrow with thy spectacles
 o where is faith o where is loyalty
 if it be banish'd from the frosty head
 where shall it find a harbour in the earth
 wilt thou go dig a grave to find out war
 and shame thine honourable age with blood
 why art thou old and want'st experience
 or wherefore dost abuse it if thou hast it
 for shame in duty bend thy knee to me
 that bows unto the grave with mickle age
salisbury my lord i have consider'd with myself
 the title of this most renowned duke
 and in my conscience do repute his grace
 the rightful heir to england's royal seat
king henry vi hast thou not sworn allegiance unto me
salisbury i have
king henry vi canst thou dispense with heaven for such an oath
salisbury it is great sin to swear unto a sin
 but greater sin to keep a sinful oath
 who can be bound by any solemn vow
 to do a murderous deed to rob a man
 to force a spotless virgin's chastity
 to reave the orphan of his patrimony
 to wring the widow from her custom'd right
 and have no other reason for this wrong
 but that he was bound by a solemn oath
queen margaret a subtle traitor needs no sophister
king henry vi call buckingham and bid him arm himself
york call buckingham and all the friends thou hast
 i am resolved for death or dignity
clifford the first i warrant thee if dreams prove true
warwick you were best to go to bed and dream again
 to keep thee from the tempest of the field
clifford i am resolved to bear a greater storm
 than any thou canst conjure up today
 and that i'll write upon thy burgonet
 might i but know thee by thy household badge
warwick now by my father's badge old nevil's crest
 the rampant bear chain'd to the ragged staff
 this day i'll wear aloft my burgonet
 as on a mountain top the cedar shows
 that keeps his leaves in spite of any storm
 even to affright thee with the view thereof
clifford and from thy burgonet i'll rend thy bear
 and tread it under foot with all contempt
 despite the bearward that protects the bear
young clifford and so to arms victorious father
 to quell the rebels and their complices
richard fie charity for shame speak not in spite
 for you shall sup with jesu christ tonight
young clifford foul stigmatic that's more than thou canst tell
richard if not in heaven you'll surely sup in hell
 exeunt severally

act v
scene ii saint alban's
 alarums to the battle enter warwick
warwick clifford of cumberland tis warwick calls
 and if thou dost not hide thee from the bear
 now when the angry trumpet sounds alarum
 and dead men's cries do fill the empty air
 clifford i say come forth and fight with me
 proud northern lord clifford of cumberland
 warwick is hoarse with calling thee to arms
 enter york
 how now my noble lord what all afoot
york the deadlyhanded clifford slew my steed
 but match to match i have encounter'd him
 and made a prey for carrion kites and crows
 even of the bonny beast he loved so well
 enter clifford
warwick of one or both of us the time is come
york hold warwick seek thee out some other chase
 for i myself must hunt this deer to death
warwick then nobly york tis for a crown thou fight'st
 as i intend clifford to thrive today
 it grieves my soul to leave thee unassail'd
 exit
clifford what seest thou in me york why dost thou pause
york with thy brave bearing should i be in love
 but that thou art so fast mine enemy
clifford nor should thy prowess want praise and esteem
 but that tis shown ignobly and in treason
york so let it help me now against thy sword
 as i in justice and true right express it
clifford my soul and body on the action both
york a dreadful lay address thee instantly
 they fight and clifford falls
clifford la fin couronne les oeuvres
 dies
york thus war hath given thee peace for thou art still
 peace with his soul heaven if it be thy will
 exit
 enter young clifford
young clifford shame and confusion all is on the rout
 fear frames disorder and disorder wounds
 where it should guard o war thou son of hell
 whom angry heavens do make their minister
 throw in the frozen bosoms of our part
 hot coals of vengeance let no soldier fly
 he that is truly dedicate to war
 hath no selflove nor he that loves himself
 hath not essentially but by circumstance
 the name of valour
 seeing his dead father
 o let the vile world end
 and the premised flames of the last day
 knit earth and heaven together
 now let the general trumpet blow his blast
 particularities and petty sounds
 to cease wast thou ordain'd dear father
 to lose thy youth in peace and to achieve
 the silver livery of advised age
 and in thy reverence and thy chairdays thus
 to die in ruffian battle even at this sight
 my heart is turn'd to stone and while tis mine
 it shall be stony york not our old men spares
 no more will i their babes tears virginal
 shall be to me even as the dew to fire
 and beauty that the tyrant oft reclaims
 shall to my flaming wrath be oil and flax
 henceforth i will not have to do with pity
 meet i an infant of the house of york
 into as many gobbets will i cut it
 as wild medea young absyrtus did
 in cruelty will i seek out my fame
 come thou new ruin of old clifford's house
 as did aeneas old anchises bear
 so bear i thee upon my manly shoulders
 but then aeneas bare a living load
 nothing so heavy as these woes of mine
 exit bearing off his father
 enter richard and somerset to fight somerset
 is killed
richard so lie thou there
 for underneath an alehouse paltry sign
 the castle in saint alban's somerset
 hath made the wizard famous in his death
 sword hold thy temper heart be wrathful still
 priests pray for enemies but princes kill
 exit
 fight excursions enter king henry vi queen
 margaret and others
queen margaret away my lord you are slow for shame away
king henry vi can we outrun the heavens good margaret stay
queen margaret what are you made of you'll nor fight nor fly
 now is it manhood wisdom and defence
 to give the enemy way and to secure us
 by what we can which can no more but fly
 alarum afar off
 if you be ta'en we then should see the bottom
 of all our fortunes but if we haply scape
 as well we may if not through your neglect
 we shall to london get where you are loved
 and where this breach now in our fortunes made
 may readily be stopp'd
 reenter young clifford
young clifford but that my heart's on future mischief set
 i would speak blasphemy ere bid you fly
 but fly you must uncurable discomfit
 reigns in the hearts of all our present parts
 away for your relief and we will live
 to see their day and them our fortune give
 away my lord away

act v
scene iii fields near st alban's
 alarum retreat enter york richard warwick
 and soldiers with drum and colours
york of salisbury who can report of him
 that winter lion who in rage forgets
 aged contusions and all brush of time
 and like a gallant in the brow of youth
 repairs him with occasion this happy day
 is not itself nor have we won one foot
 if salisbury be lost
richard my noble father
 three times today i holp him to his horse
 three times bestrid him thrice i led him off
 persuaded him from any further act
 but still where danger was still there i met him
 and like rich hangings in a homely house
 so was his will in his old feeble body
 but noble as he is look where he comes
