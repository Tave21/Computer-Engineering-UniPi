for men diseased but i my mistress thrall
 came there for cure and this by that i prove
 love's fire heats water water cools not love
 the passionate pilgrim
i
when my love swears that she is made of truth
i do believe her though i know she lies
that she might think me some untutor'd youth
unskilful in the world's false forgeries
thus vainly thinking that she thinks me young
although i know my years be past the best
i smiling credit her falsespeaking tongue
outfacing faults in love with love's ill rest
but wherefore says my love that she is young
and wherefore say not i that i am old
o love's best habit is a soothing tongue
and age in love loves not to have years told
therefore i'll lie with love and love with me
since that our faults in love thus smother'd be
ii
two loves i have of comfort and despair
that like two spirits do suggest me still
my better angel is a man right fair
my worser spirit a woman colour'd ill
to win me soon to hell my female evil
tempteth my better angel from my side
and would corrupt my saint to be a devil
wooing his purity with her fair pride
and whether that my angel be turn'd fiend
suspect i may yet not directly tell
for being both to me both to each friend
i guess one angel in another's hell
the truth i shall not know but live in doubt
till my bad angel fire my good one out
iii
did not the heavenly rhetoric of thine eye
'gainst whom the world could not hold argument
persuade my heart to this false perjury
vows for thee broke deserve not punishment
a woman i forswore but i will prove
thou being a goddess i forswore not thee
my vow was earthly thou a heavenly love
thy grace being gain'd cures all disgrace in me
my vow was breath and breath a vapour is
then thou fair sun that on this earth doth shine
exhale this vapour vow in thee it is
if broken then it is no fault of mine
if by me broke what fool is not so wise
to break an oath to win a paradise
iv
sweet cytherea sitting by a brook
with young adonis lovely fresh and green
did court the lad with many a lovely look
such looks as none could look but beauty's queen
she told him stories to delight his ear
she showed him favors to allure his eye
to win his heart she touch'd him here and there
touches so soft still conquer chastity
but whether unripe years did want conceit
or he refused to take her figured proffer
the tender nibbler would not touch the bait
but smile and jest at every gentle offer
then fell she on her back fair queen and toward
he rose and ran away ah fool too froward
v
if love make me forsworn how shall i swear to love
o never faith could hold if not to beauty vow'd
though to myself forsworn to thee i'll constant prove
those thoughts to me like oaks to thee like osiers bow'd
study his bias leaves and makes his book thine eyes
where all those pleasures live that art can comprehend
if knowledge be the mark to know thee shall suffice
well learned is that tongue that well can thee commend
all ignorant that soul that sees thee without wonder
which is to me some praise that i thy parts admire
thine eye jove's lightning seems thy voice his dreadful
thunder
which not to anger bent is music and sweet fire
celestial as thou art o do not love that wrong
to sing heaven's praise with such an earthly tongue
vi
scarce had the sun dried up the dewy morn
and scarce the herd gone to the hedge for shade
when cytherea all in love forlorn
a longing tarriance for adonis made
under an osier growing by a brook
a brook where adon used to cool his spleen
hot was the day she hotter that did look
for his approach that often there had been
anon he comes and throws his mantle by
and stood stark naked on the brook's green brim
the sun look'd on the world with glorious eye
yet not so wistly as this queen on him
he spying her bounced in whereas he stood
'o jove quoth she why was not i a flood'
vii
fair is my love but not so fair as fickle
mild as a dove but neither true nor trusty
brighter than glass and yet as glass is brittle
softer than wax and yet as iron rusty
a lily pale with damask dye to grace her
none fairer nor none falser to deface her
her lips to mine how often hath she joined
between each kiss her oaths of true love swearing
how many tales to please me hath she coined
dreading my love the loss thereof still fearing
yet in the midst of all her pure protestings
her faith her oaths her tears and all were jestings
she burn'd with love as straw with fire flameth
she burn'd out love as soon as straw outburneth
she framed the love and yet she foil'd the framing
she bade love last and yet she fell aturning
was this a lover or a lecher whether
bad in the best though excellent in neither
viii
if music and sweet poetry agree
as they must needs the sister and the brother
then must the love be great twixt thee and me
because thou lovest the one and i the other
dowland to thee is dear whose heavenly touch
upon the lute doth ravish human sense
spenser to me whose deep conceit is such
as passing all conceit needs no defence
thou lovest to hear the sweet melodious sound
that phoebus lute the queen of music makes
and i in deep delight am chiefly drown'd
when as himself to singing he betakes
one god is god of both as poets feign
one knight loves both and both in thee remain
ix
fair was the morn when the fair queen of love
 
paler for sorrow than her milkwhite dove
for adon's sake a youngster proud and wild
her stand she takes upon a steepup hill
anon adonis comes with horn and hounds
she silly queen with more than love's good will
forbade the boy he should not pass those grounds
'once quoth she did i see a fair sweet youth
here in these brakes deepwounded with a boar
deep in the thigh a spectacle of ruth
see in my thigh quoth she here was the sore'
she showed hers he saw more wounds than one
and blushing fled and left her all alone
x
sweet rose fair flower untimely pluck'd soon vaded
pluck'd in the bud and vaded in the spring
bright orient pearl alack too timely shaded
fair creature kill'd too soon by death's sharp sting
like a green plum that hangs upon a tree
and falls through wind before the fall should be
i weep for thee and yet no cause i have
for why thou left'st me nothing in thy will
and yet thou left'st me more than i did crave
for why i craved nothing of thee still
o yes dear friend i pardon crave of thee
thy discontent thou didst bequeath to me
xi
venus with young adonis sitting by her
under a myrtle shade began to woo him
she told the youngling how god mars did try her
and as he fell to her so fell she to him
'even thus quoth she the warlike god embraced me'
and then she clipp'd adonis in her arms
'even thus quoth she the warlike god unlaced me'
as if the boy should use like loving charms
'even thus quoth she he seized on my lips'
and with her lips on his did act the seizure
and as she fetched breath away he skips
and would not take her meaning nor her pleasure
ah that i had my lady at this bay
to kiss and clip me till i run away
xii
crabbed age and youth cannot live together
youth is full of pleasance age is full of care
youth like summer morn age like winter weather
youth like summer brave age like winter bare
youth is full of sport age's breath is short
youth is nimble age is lame
youth is hot and bold age is weak and cold
youth is wild and age is tame
age i do abhor thee youth i do adore thee
o my love my love is young
age i do defy thee o sweet shepherd hie thee
for methinks thou stay'st too long
xiii
beauty is but a vain and doubtful good
a shining gloss that vadeth suddenly
a flower that dies when first it gins to bud
a brittle glass that's broken presently
a doubtful good a gloss a glass a flower
lost vaded broken dead within an hour
and as goods lost are seld or never found
as vaded gloss no rubbing will refresh
as flowers dead lie wither'd on the ground
as broken glass no cement can redress
so beauty blemish'd once's for ever lost
in spite of physic painting pain and cost
xiv
good night good rest ah neither be my share
