 i take my leave before i have begun
 for sorrow ends not when it seemeth done
 commend me to thy brother edmund york
 lo this is allnay yet depart not so
 though this be all do not so quickly go
 i shall remember more bid himah what
 with all good speed at plashy visit me
 alack and what shall good old york there see
 but empty lodgings and unfurnish'd walls
 unpeopled offices untrodden stones
 and what hear there for welcome but my groans
 therefore commend me let him not come there
 to seek out sorrow that dwells every where
 desolate desolate will i hence and die
 the last leave of thee takes my weeping eye

 and bow my knee before his majesty

 and loving farewell of our several friends

 and craves to kiss your hand and take his leave

 lament we may but not revenge thee dead
henry bolingbroke o let no noble eye profane a tear
 for me if i be gored with mowbray's spear
 as confident as is the falcon's flight
 against a bird do i with mowbray fight
 my loving lord i take my leave of you
 of you my noble cousin lord aumerle
 not sick although i have to do with death
 but lusty young and cheerly drawing breath
 lo as at english feasts so i regreet
 the daintiest last to make the end most sweet
 o thou the earthly author of my blood
 whose youthful spirit in me regenerate
 doth with a twofold vigour lift me up
 to reach at victory above my head
 add proof unto mine armour with thy prayers
 and with thy blessings steel my lance's point
 that it may enter mowbray's waxen coat
 and furbish new the name of john a gaunt
 even in the lusty havior of his son
john of gaunt god in thy good cause make thee prosperous
 be swift like lightning in the execution
 and let thy blows doubly redoubled
 fall like amazing thunder on the casque
 of thy adverse pernicious enemy

henry bolingbroke mine innocency and saint george to thrive
thomas mowbray however god or fortune cast my lot
 there lives or dies true to king richard's throne
 a loyal just and upright gentleman
 never did captive with a freer heart
 cast off his chains of bondage and embrace
 his golden uncontroll'd enfranchisement
 more than my dancing soul doth celebrate
 this feast of battle with mine adversary
 most mighty liege and my companion peers
 take from my mouth the wish of happy years
 as gentle and as jocund as to jest
 go i to fight truth hath a quiet breast
king richard ii farewell my lord securely i espy
 virtue with valour couched in thine eye
 order the trial marshal and begin
lord marshal harry of hereford lancaster and derby
 receive thy lance and god defend the right
henry bolingbroke strong as a tower in hope i cry amen
lord marshal go bear this lance to thomas duke of norfolk
first herald harry of hereford lancaster and derby
 stands here for god his sovereign and himself
 on pain to be found false and recreant
 to prove the duke of norfolk thomas mowbray
 a traitor to his god his king and him
 and dares him to set forward to the fight
second herald here standeth thomas mowbray duke of norfolk
 on pain to be found false and recreant
 both to defend himself and to approve
 henry of hereford lancaster and derby
 to god his sovereign and to him disloyal
 courageously and with a free desire
 attending but the signal to begin
lord marshal sound trumpets and set forward combatants
 a charge sounded
 stay the king hath thrown his warder down
king richard ii let them lay by their helmets and their spears
 and both return back to their chairs again
 withdraw with us and let the trumpets sound
 while we return these dukes what we decree
 a long flourish
 draw near
 and list what with our council we have done
 for that our kingdom's earth should not be soil'd
 with that dear blood which it hath fostered
 and for our eyes do hate the dire aspect
 of civil wounds plough'd up with neighbours sword
 and for we think the eaglewinged pride
 of skyaspiring and ambitious thoughts
 with rivalhating envy set on you
 to wake our peace which in our country's cradle
 draws the sweet infant breath of gentle sleep
 which so roused up with boisterous untuned drums
 with harsh resounding trumpets dreadful bray
 and grating shock of wrathful iron arms
 might from our quiet confines fright fair peace
 and make us wade even in our kindred's blood
 therefore we banish you our territories
 you cousin hereford upon pain of life
 till twice five summers have enrich'd our fields
 shall not regreet our fair dominions
 but tread the stranger paths of banishment
henry bolingbroke your will be done this must my comfort be
 sun that warms you here shall shine on me
 and those his golden beams to you here lent
 shall point on me and gild my banishment
king richard ii norfolk for thee remains a heavier doom
 which i with some unwillingness pronounce
 the sly slow hours shall not determinate
 the dateless limit of thy dear exile
 the hopeless word of never to return'
 breathe i against thee upon pain of life
thomas mowbray a heavy sentence my most sovereign liege
 and all unlook'd for from your highness mouth
 a dearer merit not so deep a maim
 as to be cast forth in the common air
 have i deserved at your highness hands
 the language i have learn'd these forty years
 my native english now i must forego
 and now my tongue's use is to me no more
 than an unstringed viol or a harp
 or like a cunning instrument cased up
 or being open put into his hands
 that knows no touch to tune the harmony
 within my mouth you have engaol'd my tongue
 doubly portcullis'd with my teeth and lips
 and dull unfeeling barren ignorance
 is made my gaoler to attend on me
 i am too old to fawn upon a nurse
 too far in years to be a pupil now
 what is thy sentence then but speechless death
