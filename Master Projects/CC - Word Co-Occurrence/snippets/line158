 our separation so abides and flies
 that thou residing here go'st yet with me
 and i hence fleeting here remain with thee away

act i
scene iv rome octavius caesar's house
 enter octavius caesar reading a letter lepidus
 and their train
octavius caesar you may see lepidus and henceforth know
 it is not caesar's natural vice to hate
 our great competitor from alexandria
 this is the news he fishes drinks and wastes
 the lamps of night in revel is not more manlike
 than cleopatra nor the queen of ptolemy
 more womanly than he hardly gave audience or
 vouchsafed to think he had partners you shall find there
 a man who is the abstract of all faults
 that all men follow
lepidus i must not think there are
 evils enow to darken all his goodness
 his faults in him seem as the spots of heaven
 more fiery by night's blackness hereditary
 rather than purchased what he cannot change
 than what he chooses
octavius caesar you are too indulgent let us grant it is not
 amiss to tumble on the bed of ptolemy
 to give a kingdom for a mirth to sit
 and keep the turn of tippling with a slave
 to reel the streets at noon and stand the buffet
 with knaves that smell of sweat say this
 becomes him
 as his composure must be rare indeed
 whom these things cannot blemishyet must antony
 no way excuse his soils when we do bear
 so great weight in his lightness if he fill'd
 his vacancy with his voluptuousness
 full surfeits and the dryness of his bones
 call on him for't but to confound such time
 that drums him from his sport and speaks as loud
 as his own state and ours'tis to be chid
 as we rate boys who being mature in knowledge
 pawn their experience to their present pleasure
 and so rebel to judgment
 enter a messenger
lepidus here's more news
messenger thy biddings have been done and every hour
 most noble caesar shalt thou have report
 how tis abroad pompey is strong at sea
 and it appears he is beloved of those
 that only have fear'd caesar to the ports
 the discontents repair and men's reports
 give him much wrong'd
octavius caesar i should have known no less
 it hath been taught us from the primal state
 that he which is was wish'd until he were
 and the ebb'd man ne'er loved till ne'er worth love
 comes dear'd by being lack'd this common body
 like to a vagabond flag upon the stream
 goes to and back lackeying the varying tide
 to rot itself with motion
messenger caesar i bring thee word
 menecrates and menas famous pirates
 make the sea serve them which they ear and wound
 with keels of every kind many hot inroads
 they make in italy the borders maritime
 lack blood to think on't and flush youth revolt
 no vessel can peep forth but tis as soon
 taken as seen for pompey's name strikes more
 than could his war resisted
octavius caesar antony
 leave thy lascivious wassails when thou once
 wast beaten from modena where thou slew'st
 hirtius and pansa consuls at thy heel
 did famine follow whom thou fought'st against
 though daintily brought up with patience more
 than savages could suffer thou didst drink
 the stale of horses and the gilded puddle
 which beasts would cough at thy palate then did deign
 the roughest berry on the rudest hedge
 yea like the stag when snow the pasture sheets
 the barks of trees thou browsed'st on the alps
 it is reported thou didst eat strange flesh
 which some did die to look on and all this
 it wounds thine honour that i speak it now
 was borne so like a soldier that thy cheek
 so much as lank'd not
lepidus tis pity of him
octavius caesar let his shames quickly
 drive him to rome tis time we twain
 did show ourselves i the field and to that end
 assemble we immediate council pompey
 thrives in our idleness
lepidus tomorrow caesar
 i shall be furnish'd to inform you rightly
 both what by sea and land i can be able
 to front this present time
octavius caesar till which encounter
 it is my business too farewell
lepidus farewell my lord what you shall know meantime
 of stirs abroad i shall beseech you sir
 to let me be partaker
octavius caesar doubt not sir
 i knew it for my bond

scene v alexandria cleopatra's palace
 enter cleopatra charmian iras and mardian
cleopatra charmian
charmian madam
cleopatra ha ha
 give me to drink mandragora
charmian why madam
cleopatra that i might sleep out this great gap of time
 my antony is away
charmian you think of him too much
cleopatra o tis treason
charmian madam i trust not so
cleopatra thou eunuch mardian
mardian what's your highness pleasure
cleopatra not now to hear thee sing i take no pleasure
 in aught an eunuch has tis well for thee
 that being unseminar'd thy freer thoughts
 may not fly forth of egypt hast thou affections
mardian yes gracious madam
cleopatra indeed
mardian not in deed madam for i can do nothing
 but what indeed is honest to be done
 yet have i fierce affections and think
 what venus did with mars
cleopatra o charmian
 where think'st thou he is now stands he or sits he
 or does he walk or is he on his horse
 o happy horse to bear the weight of antony
 do bravely horse for wot'st thou whom thou movest
 the demiatlas of this earth the arm
 and burgonet of men he's speaking now
 or murmuring where's my serpent of old nile'
 for so he calls me now i feed myself
 with most delicious poison think on me
 that am with phoebus amorous pinches black
 and wrinkled deep in time broadfronted caesar
 when thou wast here above the ground i was
 a morsel for a monarch and great pompey
 would stand and make his eyes grow in my brow
 there would he anchor his aspect and die
 with looking on his life
 enter alexas from octavius caesar
alexas sovereign of egypt hail
cleopatra how much unlike art thou mark antony
 yet coming from him that great medicine hath
 with his tinct gilded thee
 how goes it with my brave mark antony
alexas last thing he did dear queen
 he kiss'dthe last of many doubled kisses
 this orient pearl his speech sticks in my heart
cleopatra mine ear must pluck it thence
alexas good friend quoth he
 say the firm roman to great egypt sends
 this treasure of an oyster at whose foot
 to mend the petty present i will piece
 her opulent throne with kingdoms all the east
 say thou shall call her mistress so he nodded
 and soberly did mount an armgaunt steed
 who neigh'd so high that what i would have spoke
 was beastly dumb'd by him
cleopatra what was he sad or merry
alexas like to the time o the year between the extremes
 of hot and cold he was nor sad nor merry
cleopatra o welldivided disposition note him
 note him good charmian tis the man but note him
 he was not sad for he would shine on those
 that make their looks by his he was not merry
 which seem'd to tell them his remembrance lay
 in egypt with his joy but between both
 o heavenly mingle be'st thou sad or merry
 the violence of either thee becomes
 so does it no man else met'st thou my posts
alexas ay madam twenty several messengers
 why do you send so thick
cleopatra who's born that day
 when i forget to send to antony
 shall die a beggar ink and paper charmian
 welcome my good alexas did i charmian
 ever love caesar so
charmian o that brave caesar
cleopatra be choked with such another emphasis
 say the brave antony
charmian the valiant caesar
cleopatra by isis i will give thee bloody teeth
 if thou with caesar paragon again
 my man of men
charmian by your most gracious pardon
 i sing but after you
cleopatra my salad days
 when i was green in judgment cold in blood
