 and lighted
 the little o the earth
dolabella most sovereign creature
cleopatra his legs bestrid the ocean his rear'd arm
 crested the world his voice was propertied
 as all the tuned spheres and that to friends
 but when he meant to quail and shake the orb
 he was as rattling thunder for his bounty
 there was no winter in't an autumn twas
 that grew the more by reaping his delights
 were dolphinlike they show'd his back above
 the element they lived in in his livery
 walk'd crowns and crownets realms and islands were
 as plates dropp'd from his pocket
dolabella cleopatra
cleopatra think you there was or might be such a man
 as this i dream'd of
dolabella gentle madam no
cleopatra you lie up to the hearing of the gods
 but if there be or ever were one such
 it's past the size of dreaming nature wants stuff
 to vie strange forms with fancy yet to imagine
 and antony were nature's piece gainst fancy
 condemning shadows quite
dolabella hear me good madam
 your loss is as yourself great and you bear it
 as answering to the weight would i might never
 o'ertake pursued success but i do feel
 by the rebound of yours a grief that smites
 my very heart at root
cleopatra i thank you sir
 know you what caesar means to do with me
dolabella i am loath to tell you what i would you knew
cleopatra nay pray you sir
dolabella though he be honourable
cleopatra he'll lead me then in triumph
dolabella madam he will i know't
 flourish and shout within make way there
 octavius caesar'
 enter octavius caesar gallus proculeius
 mecaenas seleucus and others of his train
octavius caesar which is the queen of egypt
dolabella it is the emperor madam
 cleopatra kneels
octavius caesar arise you shall not kneel
 i pray you rise rise egypt
cleopatra sir the gods
 will have it thus my master and my lord
 i must obey
octavius caesar take to you no hard thoughts
 the record of what injuries you did us
 though written in our flesh we shall remember
 as things but done by chance
cleopatra sole sir o the world
 i cannot project mine own cause so well
 to make it clear but do confess i have
 been laden with like frailties which before
 have often shamed our sex
octavius caesar cleopatra know
 we will extenuate rather than enforce
 if you apply yourself to our intents
 which towards you are most gentle you shall find
 a benefit in this change but if you seek
 to lay on me a cruelty by taking
 antony's course you shall bereave yourself
 of my good purposes and put your children
 to that destruction which i'll guard them from
 if thereon you rely i'll take my leave
cleopatra and may through all the world tis yours and we
 your scutcheons and your signs of conquest shall
 hang in what place you please here my good lord
octavius caesar you shall advise me in all for cleopatra
cleopatra this is the brief of money plate and jewels
 i am possess'd of tis exactly valued
 not petty things admitted where's seleucus
seleucus here madam
cleopatra this is my treasurer let him speak my lord
 upon his peril that i have reserved
 to myself nothing speak the truth seleucus
seleucus madam
 i had rather seal my lips than to my peril
 speak that which is not
cleopatra what have i kept back
seleucus enough to purchase what you have made known
octavius caesar nay blush not cleopatra i approve
 your wisdom in the deed
cleopatra see caesar o behold
 how pomp is follow'd mine will now be yours
 and should we shift estates yours would be mine
 the ingratitude of this seleucus does
 even make me wild o slave of no more trust
 than love that's hired what goest thou back thou shalt
 go back i warrant thee but i'll catch thine eyes
 though they had wings slave soulless villain dog
 o rarely base
octavius caesar good queen let us entreat you
cleopatra o caesar what a wounding shame is this
 that thou vouchsafing here to visit me
 doing the honour of thy lordliness
 to one so meek that mine own servant should
 parcel the sum of my disgraces by
 addition of his envy say good caesar
 that i some lady trifles have reserved
 immoment toys things of such dignity
 as we greet modern friends withal and say
 some nobler token i have kept apart
 for livia and octavia to induce
 their mediation must i be unfolded
 with one that i have bred the gods it smites me
 beneath the fall i have
 to seleucus
 prithee go hence
 or i shall show the cinders of my spirits
 through the ashes of my chance wert thou a man
 thou wouldst have mercy on me
octavius caesar forbear seleucus
 exit seleucus
cleopatra be it known that we the greatest are misthought
 for things that others do and when we fall
 we answer others merits in our name
 are therefore to be pitied
octavius caesar cleopatra
 not what you have reserved nor what acknowledged
 put we i the roll of conquest still be't yours
 bestow it at your pleasure and believe
 caesar's no merchant to make prize with you
 of things that merchants sold therefore be cheer'd
 make not your thoughts your prisons no dear queen
 for we intend so to dispose you as
 yourself shall give us counsel feed and sleep
 our care and pity is so much upon you
 that we remain your friend and so adieu
cleopatra my master and my lord
octavius caesar not so adieu
 flourish exeunt octavius caesar and his train
cleopatra he words me girls he words me that i should not
 be noble to myself but hark thee charmian

 adieu good queen i must attend on caesar
cleopatra farewell and thanks
 exit dolabella
 now iras what think'st thou
 thou an egyptian puppet shalt be shown
 in rome as well as i mechanic slaves
 with greasy aprons rules and hammers shall
 uplift us to the view in their thick breaths
 rank of gross diet shall be enclouded
 and forced to drink their vapour
iras the gods forbid
cleopatra nay tis most certain iras saucy lictors
 will catch at us like strumpets and scald rhymers
 ballad us out o tune the quick comedians
 extemporally will stage us and present
 our alexandrian revels antony
 shall be brought drunken forth and i shall see
 some squeaking cleopatra boy my greatness
 i the posture of a whore
iras o the good gods
cleopatra nay that's certain
iras i'll never see t for i am sure my nails
 are stronger than mine eyes
cleopatra why that's the way
 to fool their preparation and to conquer
 their most absurd intents
 reenter charmian
 now charmian
 show me my women like a queen go fetch
 my best attires i am again for cydnus
 to meet mark antony sirrah iras go
 now noble charmian we'll dispatch indeed
 and when thou hast done this chare i'll give thee leave
 to play till doomsday bring our crown and all
 wherefore's this noise
 exit iras a noise within
 enter a guardsman
guard here is a rural fellow
 that will not be denied your highness presence
 he brings you figs
cleopatra let him come in
