 sceptre for a leaden dagger and thy precious rich
 crown for a pitiful bald crown

 for tears do stop the floodgates of her eyes
hostess o jesu he doth it as like one of these harlotry
 players as ever i see
falstaff peace good pintpot peace good ticklebrain
 harry i do not only marvel where thou spendest thy
 time but also how thou art accompanied for though
 the camomile the more it is trodden on the faster
 it grows yet youth the more it is wasted the
 sooner it wears that thou art my son i have
 partly thy mother's word partly my own opinion
 but chiefly a villanous trick of thine eye and a
 foolishhanging of thy nether lip that doth warrant
 me if then thou be son to me here lies the point
 why being son to me art thou so pointed at shall
 the blessed sun of heaven prove a micher and eat
 blackberries a question not to be asked shall
 the sun of england prove a thief and take purses a
 question to be asked there is a thing harry
 which thou hast often heard of and it is known to
 many in our land by the name of pitch this pitch
 as ancient writers do report doth defile so doth
 the company thou keepest for harry now i do not
 speak to thee in drink but in tears not in
 pleasure but in passion not in words only but in
 woes also and yet there is a virtuous man whom i
 have often noted in thy company but i know not his name
prince henry what manner of man an it like your majesty
falstaff a goodly portly man i faith and a corpulent of a
 cheerful look a pleasing eye and a most noble
 carriage and as i think his age some fifty or
 by'r lady inclining to three score and now i
 remember me his name is falstaff if that man
 should be lewdly given he deceiveth me for harry
 i see virtue in his looks if then the tree may be
 known by the fruit as the fruit by the tree then
 peremptorily i speak it there is virtue in that
 falstaff him keep with the rest banish and tell
 me now thou naughty varlet tell me where hast
 thou been this month
prince henry dost thou speak like a king do thou stand for me
 and i'll play my father
falstaff depose me if thou dost it half so gravely so
 majestically both in word and matter hang me up by
 the heels for a rabbitsucker or a poulter's hare
prince henry well here i am set
