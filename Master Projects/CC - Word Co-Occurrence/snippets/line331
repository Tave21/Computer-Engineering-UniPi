'nor gives it satisfaction to our blood
that we must curb it upon others proof
to be forbod the sweets that seem so good
for fear of harms that preach in our behoof
o appetite from judgment stand aloof
the one a palate hath that needs will taste
though reason weep and cry it is thy last'
'for further i could say this man's untrue'
and knew the patterns of his foul beguiling
heard where his plants in others orchards grew
saw how deceits were gilded in his smiling
knew vows were ever brokers to defiling
thought characters and words merely but art
and bastards of his foul adulterate heart
'and long upon these terms i held my city
till thus he gan besiege me gentle maid
have of my suffering youth some feeling pity
and be not of my holy vows afraid
that's to ye sworn to none was ever said
for feasts of love i have been call'd unto
till now did ne'er invite nor never woo
''all my offences that abroad you see
are errors of the blood none of the mind
love made them not with acture they may be
where neither party is nor true nor kind
they sought their shame that so their shame did find
and so much less of shame in me remains
by how much of me their reproach contains
''among the many that mine eyes have seen
not one whose flame my heart so much as warm'd
or my affection put to the smallest teen
or any of my leisures ever charm'd
harm have i done to them but ne'er was harm'd
kept hearts in liveries but mine own was free
and reign'd commanding in his monarchy
''look here what tributes wounded fancies sent me
of paled pearls and rubies red as blood
figuring that they their passions likewise lent me
of grief and blushes aptly understood
in bloodless white and the encrimson'd mood
effects of terror and dear modesty
encamp'd in hearts but fighting outwardly
''and lo behold these talents of their hair
with twisted metal amorously impleach'd
i have received from many a several fair
their kind acceptance weepingly beseech'd
with the annexions of fair gems enrich'd
and deepbrain'd sonnets that did amplify
each stone's dear nature worth and quality
''the diamondwhy twas beautiful and hard
whereto his invised properties did tend
the deepgreen emerald in whose fresh regard
weak sights their sickly radiance do amend
the heavenhued sapphire and the opal blend
with objects manifold each several stone
with wit well blazon'd smiled or made some moan
''lo all these trophies of affections hot
of pensived and subdued desires the tender
nature hath charged me that i hoard them not
but yield them up where i myself must render
that is to you my origin and ender
for these of force must your oblations be
since i their altar you enpatron me
''o then advance of yours that phraseless hand
whose white weighs down the airy scale of praise
take all these similes to your own command
hallow'd with sighs that burning lungs did raise
what me your minister for you obeys
works under you and to your audit comes
their distract parcels in combined sums
''lo this device was sent me from a nun
or sister sanctified of holiest note
which late her noble suit in court did shun
whose rarest havings made the blossoms dote
for she was sought by spirits of richest coat
but kept cold distance and did thence remove
to spend her living in eternal love
''but o my sweet what labour is't to leave
the thing we have not mastering what not strives
playing the place which did no form receive
playing patient sports in unconstrained gyves
she that her fame so to herself contrives
the scars of battle scapeth by the flight
and makes her absence valiant not her might
''o pardon me in that my boast is true
the accident which brought me to her eye
upon the moment did her force subdue
and now she would the caged cloister fly
religious love put out religion's eye
not to be tempted would she be immured
and now to tempt all liberty procured
''how mighty then you are o hear me tell
the broken bosoms that to me belong
have emptied all their fountains in my well
and mine i pour your ocean all among
i strong o'er them and you o'er me being strong
must for your victory us all congest
as compound love to physic your cold breast
''my parts had power to charm a sacred nun
who disciplined ay dieted in grace
believed her eyes when they to assail begun
all vows and consecrations giving place
o most potential love vow bond nor space
in thee hath neither sting knot nor confine
for thou art all and all things else are thine
''when thou impressest what are precepts worth
of stale example when thou wilt inflame
how coldly those impediments stand forth
of wealth of filial fear law kindred fame
love's arms are peace gainst rule gainst sense
'gainst shame
and sweetens in the suffering pangs it bears
the aloes of all forces shocks and fears
''now all these hearts that do on mine depend
feeling it break with bleeding groans they pine
and supplicant their sighs to you extend
to leave the battery that you make gainst mine
lending soft audience to my sweet design
and credent soul to that strongbonded oath
that shall prefer and undertake my troth'
'this said his watery eyes he did dismount
whose sights till then were levell'd on my face
each cheek a river running from a fount
with brinish current downward flow'd apace
o how the channel to the stream gave grace
who glazed with crystal gate the glowing roses
that flame through water which their hue encloses
'o father what a hell of witchcraft lies
in the small orb of one particular tear
but with the inundation of the eyes
what rocky heart to water will not wear
what breast so cold that is not warmed here
o cleft effect cold modesty hot wrath
both fire from hence and chill extincture hath
'for lo his passion but an art of craft
even there resolved my reason into tears
there my white stole of chastity i daff'd
shook off my sober guards and civil fears
appear to him as he to me appears
all melting though our drops this difference bore
his poison'd me and mine did him restore
'in him a plenitude of subtle matter
applied to cautels all strange forms receives
of burning blushes or of weeping water
or swooning paleness and he takes and leaves
in either's aptness as it best deceives
to blush at speeches rank to weep at woes
or to turn white and swoon at tragic shows
'that not a heart which in his level came
could scape the hail of his allhurting aim
showing fair nature is both kind and tame
and veil'd in them did win whom he would maim
against the thing he sought he would exclaim
when he most burn'd in heartwish'd luxury
he preach'd pure maid and praised cold chastity
'thus merely with the garment of a grace
the naked and concealed fiend he cover'd
that th unexperient gave the tempter place
which like a cherubin above them hover'd
who young and simple would not be so lover'd
ay me i fell and yet do question make
what i should do again for such a sake
'o that infected moisture of his eye
o that false fire which in his cheek so glow'd
o that forced thunder from his heart did fly
o that sad breath his spongy lungs bestow'd
o all that borrow'd motion seeming owed
would yet again betray the forebetray'd
and new pervert a reconciled maid'

the love i dedicate to your lordship is without end whereof
this pamphlet without beginning is but a superfluous moiety
the warrant i have of your honourable disposition not the worth
