act i
scene i rome before the capitol
 the tomb of the andronici appearing the tribunes
 and senators aloft enter below from one side
 saturninus and his followers and from the other
 side bassianus and his followers with drum and colours
saturninus noble patricians patrons of my right
 defend the justice of my cause with arms
 and countrymen my loving followers
 plead my successive title with your swords
 i am his firstborn son that was the last
 that wore the imperial diadem of rome
 then let my father's honours live in me
 nor wrong mine age with this indignity
bassianus romans friends followers favorers of my right
 if ever bassianus caesar's son
 were gracious in the eyes of royal rome
 keep then this passage to the capitol
 and suffer not dishonour to approach
 the imperial seat to virtue consecrate
 to justice continence and nobility
 but let desert in pure election shine
 and romans fight for freedom in your choice
 enter marcus andronicus aloft with the crown
marcus andronicus princes that strive by factions and by friends
 ambitiously for rule and empery
 know that the people of rome for whom we stand
 a special party have by common voice
 in election for the roman empery
 chosen andronicus surnamed pius
 for many good and great deserts to rome
 a nobler man a braver warrior
 lives not this day within the city walls
 he by the senate is accit'd home
 from weary wars against the barbarous goths
 that with his sons a terror to our foes
 hath yoked a nation strong train'd up in arms
 ten years are spent since first he undertook
 this cause of rome and chastised with arms
 our enemies pride five times he hath return'd
 bleeding to rome bearing his valiant sons
 in coffins from the field
 and now at last laden with horror's spoils
 returns the good andronicus to rome
 renowned titus flourishing in arms
 let us entreat by honour of his name
 whom worthily you would have now succeed
 and in the capitol and senate's right
 whom you pretend to honour and adore
 that you withdraw you and abate your strength
 dismiss your followers and as suitors should
 plead your deserts in peace and humbleness
saturninus how fair the tribune speaks to calm my thoughts
bassianus marcus andronicus so i do ally
 in thy uprightness and integrity
 and so i love and honour thee and thine
 thy noble brother titus and his sons
 and her to whom my thoughts are humbled all
 gracious lavinia rome's rich ornament
 that i will here dismiss my loving friends
 and to my fortunes and the people's favor
 commit my cause in balance to be weigh'd
 exeunt the followers of bassianus
saturninus friends that have been thus forward in my right
 i thank you all and here dismiss you all
 and to the love and favor of my country
 commit myself my person and the cause
 exeunt the followers of saturninus
 rome be as just and gracious unto me
 as i am confident and kind to thee
 open the gates and let me in
bassianus tribunes and me a poor competitor
 flourish saturninus and bassianus go up into the capitol
 enter a captain
captain romans make way the good andronicus
 patron of virtue rome's best champion
 successful in the battles that he fights
 with honour and with fortune is return'd
 from where he circumscribed with his sword
 and brought to yoke the enemies of rome
 drums and trumpets sounded enter martius and
 mutius after them two men bearing a coffin
 covered with black then lucius and quintus after
 them titus andronicus and then tamora with
 alarbus demetrius chiron aaron and other goths
 prisoners soldiers and people following the
 bearers set down the coffin and titus speaks
titus andronicus hail rome victorious in thy mourning weeds
 lo as the bark that hath discharged her fraught
 returns with precious jading to the bay
 from whence at first she weigh'd her anchorage
 cometh andronicus bound with laurel boughs
 to resalute his country with his tears
 tears of true joy for his return to rome
 thou great defender of this capitol
 stand gracious to the rites that we intend
 romans of five and twenty valiant sons
 half of the number that king priam had
 behold the poor remains alive and dead
 these that survive let rome reward with love
 these that i bring unto their latest home
 with burial amongst their ancestors
 here goths have given me leave to sheathe my sword
 titus unkind and careless of thine own
 why suffer'st thou thy sons unburied yet
 to hover on the dreadful shore of styx
 make way to lay them by their brethren
 the tomb is opened
 there greet in silence as the dead are wont
 and sleep in peace slain in your country's wars
 o sacred receptacle of my joys
 sweet cell of virtue and nobility
 how many sons of mine hast thou in store
 that thou wilt never render to me more
lucius give us the proudest prisoner of the goths
 that we may hew his limbs and on a pile
 ad manes fratrum sacrifice his flesh
 before this earthy prison of their bones
 that so the shadows be not unappeased
 nor we disturb'd with prodigies on earth
titus andronicus i give him you the noblest that survives
 the eldest son of this distressed queen
tamora stay roman brethren gracious conqueror
 victorious titus rue the tears i shed
 a mother's tears in passion for her son
 and if thy sons were ever dear to thee
 o think my son to be as dear to me
 sufficeth not that we are brought to rome
 to beautify thy triumphs and return
 captive to thee and to thy roman yoke
 but must my sons be slaughter'd in the streets
 for valiant doings in their country's cause
 o if to fight for king and commonweal
 were piety in thine it is in these
 andronicus stain not thy tomb with blood
 wilt thou draw near the nature of the gods
 draw near them then in being merciful
 sweet mercy is nobility's true badge
 thrice noble titus spare my firstborn son
titus andronicus patient yourself madam and pardon me
 these are their brethren whom you goths beheld
 alive and dead and for their brethren slain
 religiously they ask a sacrifice
 to this your son is mark'd and die he must
 to appease their groaning shadows that are gone
lucius away with him and make a fire straight
 and with our swords upon a pile of wood
 let's hew his limbs till they be clean consumed
 exeunt lucius quintus martius and mutius with alarbus
tamora o cruel irreligious piety
chiron was ever scythia half so barbarous
demetrius oppose not scythia to ambitious rome
 alarbus goes to rest and we survive
 to tremble under titus threatening looks
 then madam stand resolved but hope withal
 the selfsame gods that arm'd the queen of troy
 with opportunity of sharp revenge
