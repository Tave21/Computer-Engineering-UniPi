 a title for a maid of all titles the worst
hortensio now shall my friend petruchio do me grace
 and offer me disguised in sober robes
 to old baptista as a schoolmaster
 well seen in music to instruct bianca
 that so i may by this device at least
 have leave and leisure to make love to her
 and unsuspected court her by herself
grumio here's no knavery see to beguile the old folks
 how the young folks lay their heads together
 enter gremio and lucentio disguised
 master master look about you who goes there ha
hortensio peace grumio it is the rival of my love
 petruchio stand by a while
grumio a proper stripling and an amorous
gremio o very well i have perused the note
 hark you sir i'll have them very fairly bound
 all books of love see that at any hand
 and see you read no other lectures to her
 you understand me over and beside
 signior baptista's liberality
 i'll mend it with a largess take your paper too
 and let me have them very well perfumed
 for she is sweeter than perfume itself
 to whom they go to what will you read to her
lucentio whate'er i read to her i'll plead for you
 as for my patron stand you so assured
 as firmly as yourself were still in place
 yea and perhaps with more successful words
 than you unless you were a scholar sir
gremio o this learning what a thing it is
grumio o this woodcock what an ass it is
petruchio peace sirrah
hortensio grumio mum god save you signior gremio
gremio and you are well met signior hortensio
 trow you whither i am going to baptista minola
 i promised to inquire carefully
 about a schoolmaster for the fair bianca
 and by good fortune i have lighted well
 on this young man for learning and behavior
 fit for her turn well read in poetry
 and other books good ones i warrant ye
hortensio tis well and i have met a gentleman
 hath promised me to help me to another
 a fine musician to instruct our mistress
 so shall i no whit be behind in duty
 to fair bianca so beloved of me
gremio beloved of me and that my deeds shall prove
grumio and that his bags shall prove
hortensio gremio tis now no time to vent our love
 listen to me and if you speak me fair
 i'll tell you news indifferent good for either
 here is a gentleman whom by chance i met
 upon agreement from us to his liking
 will undertake to woo curst katharina
 yea and to marry her if her dowry please
gremio so said so done is well
 hortensio have you told him all her faults
petruchio i know she is an irksome brawling scold
 if that be all masters i hear no harm
gremio no say'st me so friend what countryman
petruchio born in verona old antonio's son
 my father dead my fortune lives for me
 and i do hope good days and long to see
gremio o sir such a life with such a wife were strange
 but if you have a stomach to't i god's name
 you shall have me assisting you in all
 but will you woo this wildcat
petruchio will i live
grumio will he woo her ay or i'll hang her
petruchio why came i hither but to that intent
 think you a little din can daunt mine ears
 have i not in my time heard lions roar
 have i not heard the sea puff'd up with winds
 rage like an angry boar chafed with sweat
 have i not heard great ordnance in the field
 and heaven's artillery thunder in the skies
 have i not in a pitched battle heard
 loud larums neighing steeds and trumpets clang
 and do you tell me of a woman's tongue
 that gives not half so great a blow to hear
 as will a chestnut in a farmer's fire
 tush tush fear boys with bugs
grumio for he fears none
gremio hortensio hark
 this gentleman is happily arrived
 my mind presumes for his own good and ours
hortensio i promised we would be contributors
 and bear his charging of wooing whatsoe'er
gremio and so we will provided that he win her
grumio i would i were as sure of a good dinner
 enter tranio brave and biondello
tranio gentlemen god save you if i may be bold
 tell me i beseech you which is the readiest way
 to the house of signior baptista minola
biondello he that has the two fair daughters is't he you mean
tranio even he biondello
gremio hark you sir you mean not her to
tranio perhaps him and her sir what have you to do
petruchio not her that chides sir at any hand i pray
tranio i love no chiders sir biondello let's away
lucentio well begun tranio
hortensio sir a word ere you go
 are you a suitor to the maid you talk of yea or no
tranio and if i be sir is it any offence
gremio no if without more words you will get you hence
tranio why sir i pray are not the streets as free
 for me as for you
gremio but so is not she
tranio for what reason i beseech you
gremio for this reason if you'll know
 that she's the choice love of signior gremio
hortensio that she's the chosen of signior hortensio
tranio softly my masters if you be gentlemen
 do me this right hear me with patience
 baptista is a noble gentleman
 to whom my father is not all unknown
 and were his daughter fairer than she is
 she may more suitors have and me for one
 fair leda's daughter had a thousand wooers
 then well one more may fair bianca have
 and so she shall lucentio shall make one
 though paris came in hope to speed alone
gremio what this gentleman will outtalk us all
lucentio sir give him head i know he'll prove a jade
petruchio hortensio to what end are all these words
hortensio sir let me be so bold as ask you
 did you yet ever see baptista's daughter
tranio no sir but hear i do that he hath two
 the one as famous for a scolding tongue
 as is the other for beauteous modesty
petruchio sir sir the first's for me let her go by
gremio yea leave that labour to great hercules
 and let it be more than alcides twelve
petruchio sir understand you this of me in sooth
 the youngest daughter whom you hearken for
 her father keeps from all access of suitors
 and will not promise her to any man
 until the elder sister first be wed
 the younger then is free and not before
tranio if it be so sir that you are the man
 must stead us all and me amongst the rest
 and if you break the ice and do this feat
 achieve the elder set the younger free
 for our access whose hap shall be to have her
 will not so graceless be to be ingrate
hortensio sir you say well and well you do conceive
 and since you do profess to be a suitor
 you must as we do gratify this gentleman
 to whom we all rest generally beholding
tranio sir i shall not be slack in sign whereof
 please ye we may contrive this afternoon
 and quaff carouses to our mistress health
 and do as adversaries do in law
 strive mightily but eat and drink as friends
grumio 
 o excellent motion fellows let's be gone
biondello 
hortensio the motion's good indeed and be it so
 petruchio i shall be your ben venuto

 so well i know my duty to my elders
katharina of all thy suitors here i charge thee tell

 which i could fancy more than any other
katharina minion thou liest is't not hortensio
bianca if you affect him sister here i swear
 i'll plead for you myself but you shall have

baptista why how now dame whence grows this insolence
 bianca stand aside poor girl she weeps

 for shame thou helding of a devilish spirit
 why dost thou wrong her that did ne'er wrong thee
 when did she cross thee with a bitter word
katharina her silence flouts me and i'll be revenged
 flies after bianca
baptista what in my sight bianca get thee in
 exit bianca
