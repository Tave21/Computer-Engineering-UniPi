 mars's hot minion is returned again
 her waspishheaded son has broke his arrows
 swears he will shoot no more but play with sparrows
 and be a boy right out
ceres high'st queen of state
 great juno comes i know her by her gait
 enter juno
juno how does my bounteous sister go with me
 to bless this twain that they may prosperous be
 and honour'd in their issue
 they sing
juno honour riches marriageblessing
 long continuance and increasing
 hourly joys be still upon you
 juno sings her blessings upon you
ceres earth's increase foison plenty
 barns and garners never empty
 vines and clustering bunches growing
 plants with goodly burthen bowing
 spring come to you at the farthest
 in the very end of harvest
 scarcity and want shall shun you
 ceres blessing so is on you
ferdinand this is a most majestic vision and
 harmoniously charmingly may i be bold
 to think these spirits
prospero spirits which by mine art
 i have from their confines call'd to enact
 my present fancies
ferdinand let me live here ever
 so rare a wonder'd father and a wife
 makes this place paradise
 juno and ceres whisper and send iris on
 employment
prospero sweet now silence
 juno and ceres whisper seriously
 there's something else to do hush and be mute
 or else our spell is marr'd
iris you nymphs call'd naiads of the windring brooks
 with your sedged crowns and everharmless looks
 leave your crisp channels and on this green land
 answer your summons juno does command
 come temperate nymphs and help to celebrate
 a contract of true love be not too late
 enter certain nymphs
 you sunburnt sicklemen of august weary
 come hither from the furrow and be merry
 make holiday your ryestraw hats put on
 and these fresh nymphs encounter every one
 in country footing
 enter certain reapers properly habited they
 join with the nymphs in a graceful dance
 towards the end whereof prospero starts
 suddenly and speaks after which to a
 strange hollow and confused noise they
 heavily vanish
prospero aside i had forgot that foul conspiracy
 of the beast caliban and his confederates
 against my life the minute of their plot
 is almost come
 to the spirits
 well done avoid no more
ferdinand this is strange your father's in some passion
 that works him strongly
miranda never till this day
 saw i him touch'd with anger so distemper'd
prospero you do look my son in a moved sort
 as if you were dismay'd be cheerful sir
 our revels now are ended these our actors
 as i foretold you were all spirits and
 are melted into air into thin air
 and like the baseless fabric of this vision
 the cloudcapp'd towers the gorgeous palaces
 the solemn temples the great globe itself
 ye all which it inherit shall dissolve
 and like this insubstantial pageant faded
 leave not a rack behind we are such stuff
 as dreams are made on and our little life
 is rounded with a sleep sir i am vex'd
 bear with my weakness my brain is troubled
 be not disturb'd with my infirmity
 if you be pleased retire into my cell
 and there repose a turn or two i'll walk
 to still my beating mind
ferdinand 
 we wish your peace
miranda 
 exeunt
prospero come with a thought i thank thee ariel come
 enter ariel
ariel thy thoughts i cleave to what's thy pleasure
prospero spirit
 we must prepare to meet with caliban
ariel ay my commander when i presented ceres
 i thought to have told thee of it but i fear'd
 lest i might anger thee
prospero say again where didst thou leave these varlets
ariel i told you sir they were redhot with drinking
 so fun of valour that they smote the air
 for breathing in their faces beat the ground
 for kissing of their feet yet always bending
 towards their project then i beat my tabour
 at which like unback'd colts they prick'd
 their ears
 advanced their eyelids lifted up their noses
 as they smelt music so i charm'd their ears
 that calflike they my lowing follow'd through
 tooth'd briers sharp furzes pricking goss and thorns
 which entered their frail shins at last i left them
 i the filthymantled pool beyond your cell
 there dancing up to the chins that the foul lake
 o'erstunk their feet
prospero this was well done my bird
 thy shape invisible retain thou still
 the trumpery in my house go bring it hither
 for stale to catch these thieves
ariel i go i go
 exit
prospero a devil a born devil on whose nature
 nurture can never stick on whom my pains
 humanely taken all all lost quite lost
 and as with age his body uglier grows
 so his mind cankers i will plague them all
 even to roaring
 reenter ariel loaden with glistering apparel &c
 come hang them on this line
 prospero and ariel remain invisible enter
 caliban stephano and trinculo all wet
caliban pray you tread softly that the blind mole may not
 hear a foot fall we now are near his cell
stephano monster your fairy which you say is
 a harmless fairy has done little better than
 played the jack with us
trinculo monster i do smell all horsepiss at
 which my nose is in great indignation
stephano so is mine do you hear monster if i should take
 a displeasure against you look you
trinculo thou wert but a lost monster
caliban good my lord give me thy favour still
 be patient for the prize i'll bring thee to
 shall hoodwink this mischance therefore speak softly
 all's hush'd as midnight yet
trinculo ay but to lose our bottles in the pool
stephano there is not only disgrace and dishonour in that
 monster but an infinite loss
trinculo that's more to me than my wetting yet this is your
 harmless fairy monster
stephano i will fetch off my bottle though i be o'er ears
 for my labour
caliban prithee my king be quiet seest thou here
 this is the mouth o the cell no noise and enter
 do that good mischief which may make this island
 thine own for ever and i thy caliban
 for aye thy footlicker
stephano give me thy hand i do begin to have bloody thoughts
trinculo o king stephano o peer o worthy stephano look
 what a wardrobe here is for thee
caliban let it alone thou fool it is but trash
trinculo o ho monster we know what belongs to a frippery
 o king stephano
stephano put off that gown trinculo by this hand i'll have
 that gown
trinculo thy grace shall have it
caliban the dropsy drown this fool i what do you mean
 to dote thus on such luggage let's alone
 and do the murder first if he awake
 from toe to crown he'll fill our skins with pinches
 make us strange stuff
stephano be you quiet monster mistress line
 is not this my jerkin now is the jerkin under
 the line now jerkin you are like to lose your
 hair and prove a bald jerkin
trinculo do do we steal by line and level an't like your grace
stephano i thank thee for that jest here's a garment for't
 wit shall not go unrewarded while i am king of this
 country steal by line and level is an excellent
 pass of pate there's another garment for't
trinculo monster come put some lime upon your fingers and
 away with the rest
caliban i will have none on't we shall lose our time
 and all be turn'd to barnacles or to apes
 with foreheads villanous low
stephano monster layto your fingers help to bear this
 away where my hogshead of wine is or i'll turn you
 out of my kingdom go to carry this
trinculo and this
stephano ay and this
 a noise of hunters heard enter divers spirits
 in shape of dogs and hounds and hunt them about
 prospero and ariel setting them on
prospero hey mountain hey
ariel silver i there it goes silver
prospero fury fury there tyrant there hark hark
 caliban stephano and trinculo are
 driven out
 go charge my goblins that they grind their joints
 with dry convulsions shorten up their sinews
 with aged cramps and more pinchspotted make them
 than pard or cat o mountain
ariel hark they roar
