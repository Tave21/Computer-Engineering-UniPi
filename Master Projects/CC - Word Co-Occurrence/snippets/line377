king how is that
parolles he loved her sir and loved her not
king as thou art a knave and no knave what an
 equivocal companion is this
parolles i am a poor man and at your majesty's command
lafeu he's a good drum my lord but a naughty orator
diana do you know he promised me marriage
parolles faith i know more than i'll speak
king but wilt thou not speak all thou knowest
parolles yes so please your majesty i did go between them
 as i said but more than that he loved her for
 indeed he was mad for her and talked of satan and
 of limbo and of furies and i know not what yet i
 was in that credit with them at that time that i
 knew of their going to bed and of other motions
 as promising her marriage and things which would
 derive me ill will to speak of therefore i will not
 speak what i know
king thou hast spoken all already unless thou canst say
 they are married but thou art too fine in thy
 evidence therefore stand aside
 this ring you say was yours
diana ay my good lord
king where did you buy it or who gave it you
diana it was not given me nor i did not buy it
king who lent it you
diana it was not lent me neither
king where did you find it then
diana i found it not
king if it were yours by none of all these ways
 how could you give it him
diana i never gave it him
lafeu this woman's an easy glove my lord she goes off
 and on at pleasure
king this ring was mine i gave it his first wife
diana it might be yours or hers for aught i know
king take her away i do not like her now
 to prison with her and away with him
 unless thou tell'st me where thou hadst this ring
 thou diest within this hour
diana i'll never tell you
king take her away
diana i'll put in bail my liege
king i think thee now some common customer
diana by jove if ever i knew man twas you
king wherefore hast thou accused him all this while
diana because he's guilty and he is not guilty
 he knows i am no maid and he'll swear to't
 i'll swear i am a maid and he knows not
 great king i am no strumpet by my life
 i am either maid or else this old man's wife
king she does abuse our ears to prison with her
diana good mother fetch my bail stay royal sir
 exit widow
 the jeweller that owes the ring is sent for
 and he shall surety me but for this lord
 who hath abused me as he knows himself
 though yet he never harm'd me here i quit him
 he knows himself my bed he hath defiled
 and at that time he got his wife with child
 dead though she be she feels her young one kick
 so there's my riddle one that's dead is quick
 and now behold the meaning
 reenter widow with helena
king is there no exorcist
 beguiles the truer office of mine eyes
 is't real that i see
helena no my good lord
 tis but the shadow of a wife you see
 the name and not the thing
bertram both both o pardon
helena o my good lord when i was like this maid
 i found you wondrous kind there is your ring
 and look you here's your letter this it says
 when from my finger you can get this ring
 and are by me with child &c this is done
 will you be mine now you are doubly won
bertram if she my liege can make me know this clearly
 i'll love her dearly ever ever dearly
helena if it appear not plain and prove untrue
 deadly divorce step between me and you
 o my dear mother do i see you living
lafeu mine eyes smell onions i shall weep anon
 to parolles
 good tom drum lend me a handkercher so
 i thank thee wait on me home i'll make sport with thee
 let thy courtesies alone they are scurvy ones
king let us from point to point this story know
 to make the even truth in pleasure flow
 to diana
 if thou be'st yet a fresh uncropped flower
 choose thou thy husband and i'll pay thy dower
 for i can guess that by thy honest aid
 thou keep'st a wife herself thyself a maid
 of that and all the progress more or less
 resolvedly more leisure shall express
 all yet seems well and if it end so meet
 the bitter past more welcome is the sweet
 flourish
 all's well that ends well
 epilogue
king the king's a beggar now the play is done
 all is well ended if this suit be won
 that you express content which we will pay
 with strife to please you day exceeding day
 ours be your patience then and yours our parts
 your gentle hands lend us and take our hearts

act i
scene i orchard of oliver's house
 enter orlando and adam
orlando as i remember adam it was upon this fashion
 bequeathed me by will but poor a thousand crowns
 and as thou sayest charged my brother on his
 blessing to breed me well and there begins my
 sadness my brother jaques he keeps at school and
 report speaks goldenly of his profit for my part
 he keeps me rustically at home or to speak more
 properly stays me here at home unkept for call you
 that keeping for a gentleman of my birth that
 differs not from the stalling of an ox his horses
 are bred better for besides that they are fair
 with their feeding they are taught their manage
 and to that end riders dearly hired but i his
 brother gain nothing under him but growth for the
 which his animals on his dunghills are as much
 bound to him as i besides this nothing that he so
 plentifully gives me the something that nature gave
 me his countenance seems to take from me he lets
 me feed with his hinds bars me the place of a
 brother and as much as in him lies mines my
 gentility with my education this is it adam that
 grieves me and the spirit of my father which i
 think is within me begins to mutiny against this
 servitude i will no longer endure it though yet i
 know no wise remedy how to avoid it
adam yonder comes my master your brother
orlando go apart adam and thou shalt hear how he will
 shake me up
 enter oliver
oliver now sir what make you here
orlando nothing i am not taught to make any thing
oliver what mar you then sir
orlando marry sir i am helping you to mar that which god
 made a poor unworthy brother of yours with idleness
oliver marry sir be better employed and be naught awhile
orlando shall i keep your hogs and eat husks with them
 what prodigal portion have i spent that i should
 come to such penury
oliver know you where your are sir
orlando o sir very well here in your orchard
oliver know you before whom sir
orlando ay better than him i am before knows me i know
 you are my eldest brother and in the gentle
 condition of blood you should so know me the
 courtesy of nations allows you my better in that
 you are the firstborn but the same tradition
 takes not away my blood were there twenty brothers
 betwixt us i have as much of my father in me as
 you albeit i confess your coming before me is
 nearer to his reverence
oliver what boy
