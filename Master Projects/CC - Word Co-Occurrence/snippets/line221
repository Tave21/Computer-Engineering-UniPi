 julius caesar
act i
scene iii the same a street
 thunder and lightning enter from opposite sides
 casca with his sword drawn and cicero
cicero good even casca brought you caesar home
 why are you breathless and why stare you so
casca are not you moved when all the sway of earth
 shakes like a thing unfirm o cicero
 i have seen tempests when the scolding winds
 have rived the knotty oaks and i have seen
 the ambitious ocean swell and rage and foam
 to be exalted with the threatening clouds
 but never till tonight never till now
 did i go through a tempest dropping fire
 either there is a civil strife in heaven
 or else the world too saucy with the gods
 incenses them to send destruction
cicero why saw you any thing more wonderful
casca a common slaveyou know him well by sight
 held up his left hand which did flame and burn
 like twenty torches join'd and yet his hand
 not sensible of fire remain'd unscorch'd
 besidesi ha not since put up my sword
 against the capitol i met a lion
 who glared upon me and went surly by
 without annoying me and there were drawn
 upon a heap a hundred ghastly women
 transformed with their fear who swore they saw
 men all in fire walk up and down the streets
 and yesterday the bird of night did sit
 even at noonday upon the marketplace
 hooting and shrieking when these prodigies
 do so conjointly meet let not men say
 these are their reasons they are natural'
 for i believe they are portentous things
 unto the climate that they point upon
cicero indeed it is a strangedisposed time
 but men may construe things after their fashion
 clean from the purpose of the things themselves
 come caesar to the capitol tomorrow
casca he doth for he did bid antonius
 send word to you he would be there tomorrow
cicero good night then casca this disturbed sky
 is not to walk in
casca farewell cicero
 exit cicero
 enter cassius
cassius who's there
casca a roman
cassius casca by your voice
casca your ear is good cassius what night is this
cassius a very pleasing night to honest men
casca who ever knew the heavens menace so
cassius those that have known the earth so full of faults
 for my part i have walk'd about the streets
 submitting me unto the perilous night
 and thus unbraced casca as you see
 have bared my bosom to the thunderstone
 and when the cross blue lightning seem'd to open
 the breast of heaven i did present myself
 even in the aim and very flash of it
casca but wherefore did you so much tempt the heavens
 it is the part of men to fear and tremble
 when the most mighty gods by tokens send
 such dreadful heralds to astonish us
cassius you are dull casca and those sparks of life
 that should be in a roman you do want
 or else you use not you look pale and gaze
 and put on fear and cast yourself in wonder
 to see the strange impatience of the heavens
 but if you would consider the true cause
 why all these fires why all these gliding ghosts
 why birds and beasts from quality and kind
 why old men fool and children calculate
 why all these things change from their ordinance
 their natures and preformed faculties
 to monstrous qualitywhy you shall find
 that heaven hath infused them with these spirits
 to make them instruments of fear and warning
 unto some monstrous state
 now could i casca name to thee a man
 most like this dreadful night
 that thunders lightens opens graves and roars
 as doth the lion in the capitol
 a man no mightier than thyself or me
 in personal action yet prodigious grown
 and fearful as these strange eruptions are
casca tis caesar that you mean is it not cassius
cassius let it be who it is for romans now
 have thews and limbs like to their ancestors
 but woe the while our fathers minds are dead
 and we are govern'd with our mothers spirits
 our yoke and sufferance show us womanish
casca indeed they say the senators tomorrow
 mean to establish caesar as a king
 and he shall wear his crown by sea and land
 in every place save here in italy
cassius i know where i will wear this dagger then
 cassius from bondage will deliver cassius
 therein ye gods you make the weak most strong
 therein ye gods you tyrants do defeat
 nor stony tower nor walls of beaten brass
 nor airless dungeon nor strong links of iron
 can be retentive to the strength of spirit
 but life being weary of these worldly bars
 never lacks power to dismiss itself
 if i know this know all the world besides
 that part of tyranny that i do bear
 i can shake off at pleasure
 thunder still
casca so can i
 so every bondman in his own hand bears
 the power to cancel his captivity
cassius and why should caesar be a tyrant then
 poor man i know he would not be a wolf
 but that he sees the romans are but sheep
 he were no lion were not romans hinds
 those that with haste will make a mighty fire
 begin it with weak straws what trash is rome
 what rubbish and what offal when it serves
 for the base matter to illuminate
 so vile a thing as caesar but o grief
 where hast thou led me i perhaps speak this
 before a willing bondman then i know
 my answer must be made but i am arm'd
 and dangers are to me indifferent
casca you speak to casca and to such a man
 that is no fleering telltale hold my hand
 be factious for redress of all these griefs
 and i will set this foot of mine as far
 as who goes farthest
cassius there's a bargain made
 now know you casca i have moved already
 some certain of the noblestminded romans
 to undergo with me an enterprise
 of honourabledangerous consequence
 and i do know by this they stay for me
 in pompey's porch for now this fearful night
 there is no stir or walking in the streets
 and the complexion of the element
 in favour's like the work we have in hand
 most bloody fiery and most terrible
casca stand close awhile for here comes one in haste
cassius tis cinna i do know him by his gait
 he is a friend
 enter cinna
 cinna where haste you so
cinna to find out you who's that metellus cimber
cassius no it is casca one incorporate
 to our attempts am i not stay'd for cinna
cinna i am glad on t what a fearful night is this
 there's two or three of us have seen strange sights
cassius am i not stay'd for tell me
cinna yes you are
 o cassius if you could
 but win the noble brutus to our party
cassius be you content good cinna take this paper
 and look you lay it in the praetor's chair
 where brutus may but find it and throw this
 in at his window set this up with wax
 upon old brutus statue all this done
 repair to pompey's porch where you shall find us
 is decius brutus and trebonius there
cinna all but metellus cimber and he's gone
 to seek you at your house well i will hie
 and so bestow these papers as you bade me
cassius that done repair to pompey's theatre
 exit cinna
 come casca you and i will yet ere day
 see brutus at his house three parts of him
 is ours already and the man entire
 upon the next encounter yields him ours
casca o he sits high in all the people's hearts
 and that which would appear offence in us
 his countenance like richest alchemy
 will change to virtue and to worthiness
cassius him and his worth and our great need of him
 you have right well conceited let us go
 for it is after midnight and ere day
 we will awake him and be sure of him
 exeunt
 julius caesar
act ii
scene i rome brutus's orchard
 enter brutus
brutus what lucius ho
 i cannot by the progress of the stars
 give guess how near to day lucius i say
 i would it were my fault to sleep so soundly
 when lucius when awake i say what lucius
 enter lucius
lucius call'd you my lord
brutus get me a taper in my study lucius
 when it is lighted come and call me here
lucius i will my lord
 exit
brutus it must be by his death and for my part
 i know no personal cause to spurn at him
 but for the general he would be crown'd
