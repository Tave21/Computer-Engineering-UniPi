 do not believe his vows for they are brokers
 not of that dye which their investments show
 but mere implorators of unholy suits
 breathing like sanctified and pious bawds
 the better to beguile this is for all
 i would not in plain terms from this time forth
 have you so slander any moment leisure
 as to give words or talk with the lord hamlet
 look to't i charge you come your ways
ophelia i shall obey my lord
 exeunt
 hamlet
act i
scene iv the platform
 enter hamlet horatio and marcellus
hamlet the air bites shrewdly it is very cold
horatio it is a nipping and an eager air
hamlet what hour now
horatio i think it lacks of twelve
hamlet no it is struck
horatio indeed i heard it not then it draws near the season
 wherein the spirit held his wont to walk
 a flourish of trumpets and ordnance shot off within
 what does this mean my lord
hamlet the king doth wake tonight and takes his rouse
 keeps wassail and the swaggering upspring reels
 and as he drains his draughts of rhenish down
 the kettledrum and trumpet thus bray out
 the triumph of his pledge
horatio is it a custom
hamlet ay marry is't
 but to my mind though i am native here
 and to the manner born it is a custom
 more honour'd in the breach than the observance
 this heavyheaded revel east and west
 makes us traduced and tax'd of other nations
 they clepe us drunkards and with swinish phrase
 soil our addition and indeed it takes
 from our achievements though perform'd at height
 the pith and marrow of our attribute
 so oft it chances in particular men
 that for some vicious mole of nature in them
 as in their birthwherein they are not guilty
 since nature cannot choose his origin
 by the o'ergrowth of some complexion
 oft breaking down the pales and forts of reason
 or by some habit that too much o'erleavens
 the form of plausive manners that these men
 carrying i say the stamp of one defect
 being nature's livery or fortune's star
 their virtues elsebe they as pure as grace
 as infinite as man may undergo
 shall in the general censure take corruption
 from that particular fault the dram of eale
 doth all the noble substance of a doubt
 to his own scandal
horatio look my lord it comes
 enter ghost
hamlet angels and ministers of grace defend us
 be thou a spirit of health or goblin damn'd
 bring with thee airs from heaven or blasts from hell
 be thy intents wicked or charitable
 thou comest in such a questionable shape
 that i will speak to thee i'll call thee hamlet
 king father royal dane o answer me
 let me not burst in ignorance but tell
 why thy canonized bones hearsed in death
 have burst their cerements why the sepulchre
 wherein we saw thee quietly inurn'd
 hath oped his ponderous and marble jaws
 to cast thee up again what may this mean
 that thou dead corse again in complete steel
 revisit'st thus the glimpses of the moon
 making night hideous and we fools of nature
 so horridly to shake our disposition
 with thoughts beyond the reaches of our souls
 say why is this wherefore what should we do
 ghost beckons hamlet
horatio it beckons you to go away with it
 as if it some impartment did desire
 to you alone
marcellus look with what courteous action
 it waves you to a more removed ground
 but do not go with it
horatio no by no means
hamlet it will not speak then i will follow it
horatio do not my lord
hamlet why what should be the fear
 i do not set my life in a pin's fee
 and for my soul what can it do to that
 being a thing immortal as itself
 it waves me forth again i'll follow it
horatio what if it tempt you toward the flood my lord
 or to the dreadful summit of the cliff
 that beetles o'er his base into the sea
 and there assume some other horrible form
 which might deprive your sovereignty of reason
 and draw you into madness think of it
 the very place puts toys of desperation
 without more motive into every brain
 that looks so many fathoms to the sea
 and hears it roar beneath
hamlet it waves me still
 go on i'll follow thee
marcellus you shall not go my lord
hamlet hold off your hands
horatio be ruled you shall not go
hamlet my fate cries out
 and makes each petty artery in this body
 as hardy as the nemean lion's nerve
 still am i call'd unhand me gentlemen
 by heaven i'll make a ghost of him that lets me
 i say away go on i'll follow thee
 exeunt ghost and hamlet
horatio he waxes desperate with imagination
marcellus let's follow tis not fit thus to obey him
horatio have after to what issue will this come
marcellus something is rotten in the state of denmark
horatio heaven will direct it
marcellus nay let's follow him
 exeunt
 hamlet
act i
scene v another part of the platform
 enter ghost and hamlet
hamlet where wilt thou lead me speak i'll go no further
ghost mark me
hamlet i will
ghost my hour is almost come
 when i to sulphurous and tormenting flames
 must render up myself
hamlet alas poor ghost
ghost pity me not but lend thy serious hearing
 to what i shall unfold
hamlet speak i am bound to hear
ghost so art thou to revenge when thou shalt hear
hamlet what
ghost i am thy father's spirit
 doom'd for a certain term to walk the night
 and for the day confined to fast in fires
 till the foul crimes done in my days of nature
 are burnt and purged away but that i am forbid
 to tell the secrets of my prisonhouse
 i could a tale unfold whose lightest word
 would harrow up thy soul freeze thy young blood
 make thy two eyes like stars start from their spheres
 thy knotted and combined locks to part
 and each particular hair to stand on end
 like quills upon the fretful porpentine
 but this eternal blazon must not be
 to ears of flesh and blood list list o list
 if thou didst ever thy dear father love
hamlet o god
ghost revenge his foul and most unnatural murder
hamlet murder
ghost murder most foul as in the best it is
 but this most foul strange and unnatural
hamlet haste me to know't that i with wings as swift
 as meditation or the thoughts of love
 may sweep to my revenge
ghost i find thee apt
 and duller shouldst thou be than the fat weed
 that roots itself in ease on lethe wharf
 wouldst thou not stir in this now hamlet hear
 tis given out that sleeping in my orchard
 a serpent stung me so the whole ear of denmark
 is by a forged process of my death
 rankly abused but know thou noble youth
 the serpent that did sting thy father's life
 now wears his crown
hamlet o my prophetic soul my uncle
ghost ay that incestuous that adulterate beast
 with witchcraft of his wit with traitorous gifts
 o wicked wit and gifts that have the power
 so to seducewon to his shameful lust
 the will of my most seemingvirtuous queen
 o hamlet what a fallingoff was there
 from me whose love was of that dignity
 that it went hand in hand even with the vow
 i made to her in marriage and to decline
 upon a wretch whose natural gifts were poor
 to those of mine
 but virtue as it never will be moved
 though lewdness court it in a shape of heaven
 so lust though to a radiant angel link'd
 will sate itself in a celestial bed
 and prey on garbage
 but soft methinks i scent the morning air
 brief let me be sleeping within my orchard
 my custom always of the afternoon
 upon my secure hour thy uncle stole
 with juice of cursed hebenon in a vial
 and in the porches of my ears did pour
 the leperous distilment whose effect
 holds such an enmity with blood of man
 that swift as quicksilver it courses through
 the natural gates and alleys of the body
 and with a sudden vigour doth posset
 and curd like eager droppings into milk
 the thin and wholesome blood so did it mine
