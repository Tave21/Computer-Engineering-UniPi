 found em there i smelt em out go to they are
 not men o their words they told me i was every
 thing tis a lie i am not agueproof
gloucester the trick of that voice i do well remember
 is t not the king
king lear ay every inch a king
 when i do stare see how the subject quakes
 i pardon that man's life what was thy cause adultery
 thou shalt not die die for adultery no
 the wren goes to t and the small gilded fly
 does lecher in my sight
 let copulation thrive for gloucester's bastard son
 was kinder to his father than my daughters
 got tween the lawful sheets
 to t luxury pellmell for i lack soldiers
 behold yond simpering dame
 whose face between her forks presages snow
 that minces virtue and does shake the head
 to hear of pleasure's name
 the fitchew nor the soiled horse goes to t
 with a more riotous appetite
 down from the waist they are centaurs
 though women all above
 but to the girdle do the gods inherit
 beneath is all the fiends'
 there's hell there's darkness there's the
 sulphurous pit
 burning scalding stench consumption fie
 fie fie pah pah give me an ounce of civet
 good apothecary to sweeten my imagination
 there's money for thee
gloucester o let me kiss that hand
king lear let me wipe it first it smells of mortality
gloucester o ruin'd piece of nature this great world
 shall so wear out to nought dost thou know me
king lear i remember thine eyes well enough dost thou squiny

king lear o ho are you there with me no eyes in your
 head nor no money in your purse your eyes are in
 a heavy case your purse in a light yet you see how

king lear what art mad a man may see how this world goes
 with no eyes look with thine ears see how yond
 justice rails upon yond simple thief hark in
 thine ear change places and handydandy which
 is the justice which is the thief thou hast seen
 a farmer's dog bark at a beggar
gloucester ay sir
king lear and the creature run from the cur there thou
 mightst behold the great image of authority a
 dog's obeyed in office
 thou rascal beadle hold thy bloody hand
 why dost thou lash that whore strip thine own back
 thou hotly lust'st to use her in that kind
 for which thou whipp'st her the usurer hangs the cozener
 through tatter'd clothes small vices do appear
 robes and furr'd gowns hide all plate sin with gold
 and the strong lance of justice hurtless breaks
 arm it in rags a pigmy's straw does pierce it
 none does offend none i say none i'll able em
 take that of me my friend who have the power
 to seal the accuser's lips get thee glass eyes
 and like a scurvy politician seem
 to see the things thou dost not now now now now
 pull off my boots harder harder so

 that i stand up and have ingenious feeling
 of my huge sorrows better i were distract
