saying the son of man must be delivered into the hands of sinful men and be crucified and the third day rise again
and they remembered his words
and returned from the sepulchre and told all these things unto the eleven and to all the rest
it was mary magdalene and joanna and mary the mother of james and other women that were with them which told these things unto the apostles
and their words seemed to them as idle tales and they believed them not
then arose peter and ran unto the sepulchre and stooping down he beheld the linen clothes laid by themselves and departed wondering in himself at that which was come to pass
and behold two of them went that same day to a village called emmaus which was from jerusalem about threescore furlongs
and they talked together of all these things which had happened
and it came to pass that while they communed together and reasoned jesus himself drew near and went with them
but their eyes were holden that they should not know him
and he said unto them what manner of communications are these that ye have one to another as ye walk and are sad
and the one of them whose name was cleopas answering said unto him art thou only a stranger in jerusalem and hast not known the things which are come to pass there in these days
and he said unto them what things and they said unto him concerning jesus of nazareth which was a prophet mighty in deed and word before god and all the people
and how the chief priests and our rulers delivered him to be condemned to death and have crucified him
but we trusted that it had been he which should have redeemed israel and beside all this to day is the third day since these things were done
yea and certain women also of our company made us astonished which were early at the sepulchre
and when they found not his body they came saying that they had also seen a vision of angels which said that he was alive
and certain of them which were with us went to the sepulchre and found it even so as the women had said but him they saw not
then he said unto them o fools and slow of heart to believe all that the prophets have spoken
ought not christ to have suffered these things and to enter into his glory
and beginning at moses and all the prophets he expounded unto them in all the scriptures the things concerning himself
and they drew nigh unto the village whither they went and he made as though he would have gone further
but they constrained him saying abide with us for it is toward evening and the day is far spent and he went in to tarry with them
and it came to pass as he sat at meat with them he took bread and blessed it and brake and gave to them
and their eyes were opened and they knew him and he vanished out of their sight
and they said one to another did not our heart burn within us while he talked with us by the way and while he opened to us the scriptures
and they rose up the same hour and returned to jerusalem and found the eleven gathered together and them that were with them
saying the lord is risen indeed and hath appeared to simon
and they told what things were done in the way and how he was known of them in breaking of bread
and as they thus spake jesus himself stood in the midst of them and saith unto them peace be unto you
but they were terrified and affrighted and supposed that they had seen a spirit
and he said unto them why are ye troubled and why do thoughts arise in your hearts
behold my hands and my feet that it is i myself handle me and see for a spirit hath not flesh and bones as ye see me have
and when he had thus spoken he shewed them his hands and his feet
and while they yet believed not for joy and wondered he said unto them have ye here any meat
and they gave him a piece of a broiled fish and of an honeycomb
and he took it and did eat before them
and he said unto them these are the words which i spake unto you while i was yet with you that all things must be fulfilled which were written in the law of moses and in the prophets and in the psalms concerning me
then opened he their understanding that they might understand the scriptures
and said unto them thus it is written and thus it behoved christ to suffer and to rise from the dead the third day
and that repentance and remission of sins should be preached in his name among all nations beginning at jerusalem
and ye are witnesses of these things
and behold i send the promise of my father upon you but tarry ye in the city of jerusalem until ye be endued with power from on high
and he led them out as far as to bethany and he lifted up his hands and blessed them
and it came to pass while he blessed them he was parted from them and carried up into heaven
and they worshipped him and returned to jerusalem with great joy
and were continually in the temple praising and blessing god amen
in the beginning was the word and the word was with god and the word was god
the same was in the beginning with god
all things were made by him and without him was not any thing made that was made
in him was life and the life was the light of men
and the light shineth in darkness and the darkness comprehended it not
there was a man sent from god whose name was john
the same came for a witness to bear witness of the light that all men through him might believe
he was not that light but was sent to bear witness of that light
that was the true light which lighteth every man that cometh into the world
he was in the world and the world was made by him and the world knew him not
he came unto his own and his own received him not
but as many as received him to them gave he power to become the sons of god even to them that believe on his name
which were born not of blood nor of the will of the flesh nor of the will of man but of god
and the word was made flesh and dwelt among us and we beheld his glory the glory as of the only begotten of the father full of grace and truth
john bare witness of him and cried saying this was he of whom i spake he that cometh after me is preferred before me for he was before me
and of his fulness have all we received and grace for grace
for the law was given by moses but grace and truth came by jesus christ
no man hath seen god at any time the only begotten son which is in the bosom of the father he hath declared him
and this is the record of john when the jews sent priests and levites from jerusalem to ask him who art thou
and he confessed and denied not but confessed i am not the christ
and they asked him what then art thou elias and he saith i am not art thou that prophet and he answered no
then said they unto him who art thou that we may give an answer to them that sent us what sayest thou of thyself
he said i am the voice of one crying in the wilderness make straight the way of the lord as said the prophet esaias
and they which were sent were of the pharisees
and they asked him and said unto him why baptizest thou then if thou be not that christ nor elias neither that prophet
john answered them saying i baptize with water but there standeth one among you whom ye know not
he it is who coming after me is preferred before me whose shoe's latchet i am not worthy to unloose
these things were done in bethabara beyond jordan where john was baptizing
the next day john seeth jesus coming unto him and saith behold the lamb of god which taketh away the sin of the world
this is he of whom i said after me cometh a man which is preferred before me for he was before me
and i knew him not but that he should be made manifest to israel therefore am i come baptizing with water
and john bare record saying i saw the spirit descending from heaven like a dove and it abode upon him
and i knew him not but he that sent me to baptize with water the same said unto me upon whom thou shalt see the spirit descending and remaining on him the same is he which baptizeth with the holy ghost
and i saw and bare record that this is the son of god
again the next day after john stood and two of his disciples
and looking upon jesus as he walked he saith behold the lamb of god
and the two disciples heard him speak and they followed jesus
then jesus turned and saw them following and saith unto them what seek ye they said unto him rabbi which is to say being interpreted master where dwellest thou
he saith unto them come and see they came and saw where he dwelt and abode with him that day for it was about the tenth hour
one of the two which heard john speak and followed him was andrew simon peter's brother
he first findeth his own brother simon and saith unto him we have found the messias which is being interpreted the christ
and he brought him to jesus and when jesus beheld him he said thou art simon the son of jona thou shalt be called cephas which is by interpretation a stone
the day following jesus would go forth into galilee and findeth philip and saith unto him follow me
now philip was of bethsaida the city of andrew and peter
philip findeth nathanael and saith unto him we have found him of whom moses in the law and the prophets did write jesus of nazareth the son of joseph
and nathanael said unto him can there any good thing come out of nazareth philip saith unto him come and see
jesus saw nathanael coming to him and saith of him behold an israelite indeed in whom is no guile
nathanael saith unto him whence knowest thou me jesus answered and said unto him before that philip called thee when thou wast under the fig tree i saw thee
nathanael answered and saith unto him rabbi thou art the son of god thou art the king of israel
jesus answered and said unto him because i said unto thee i saw thee under the fig tree believest thou thou shalt see greater things than these
and he saith unto him verily verily i say unto you hereafter ye shall see heaven open and the angels of god ascending and descending upon the son of man
and the third day there was a marriage in cana of galilee and the mother of jesus was there
and both jesus was called and his disciples to the marriage
and when they wanted wine the mother of jesus saith unto him they have no wine
jesus saith unto her woman what have i to do with thee mine hour is not yet come
his mother saith unto the servants whatsoever he saith unto you do it
and there were set there six waterpots of stone after the manner of the purifying of the jews containing two or three firkins apiece
jesus saith unto them fill the waterpots with water and they filled them up to the brim
and he saith unto them draw out now and bear unto the governor of the feast and they bare it
when the ruler of the feast had tasted the water that was made wine and knew not whence it was but the servants which drew the water knew the governor of the feast called the bridegroom
and saith unto him every man at the beginning doth set forth good wine and when men have well drunk then that which is worse but thou hast kept the good wine until now
this beginning of miracles did jesus in cana of galilee and manifested forth his glory and his disciples believed on him
after this he went down to capernaum he and his mother and his brethren and his disciples and they continued there not many days
and the jews passover was at hand and jesus went up to jerusalem
and found in the temple those that sold oxen and sheep and doves and the changers of money sitting
and when he had made a scourge of small cords he drove them all out of the temple and the sheep and the oxen and poured out the changers money and overthrew the tables
and said unto them that sold doves take these things hence make not my father's house an house of merchandise
and his disciples remembered that it was written the zeal of thine house hath eaten me up
then answered the jews and said unto him what sign shewest thou unto us seeing that thou doest these things
jesus answered and said unto them destroy this temple and in three days i will raise it up
then said the jews forty and six years was this temple in building and wilt thou rear it up in three days
but he spake of the temple of his body
when therefore he was risen from the dead his disciples remembered that he had said this unto them and they believed the scripture and the word which jesus had said
now when he was in jerusalem at the passover in the feast day many believed in his name when they saw the miracles which he did
but jesus did not commit himself unto them because he knew all men
and needed not that any should testify of man for he knew what was in man
there was a man of the pharisees named nicodemus a ruler of the jews
the same came to jesus by night and said unto him rabbi we know that thou art a teacher come from god for no man can do these miracles that thou doest except god be with him
jesus answered and said unto him verily verily i say unto thee except a man be born again he cannot see the kingdom of god
nicodemus saith unto him how can a man be born when he is old can he enter the second time into his mother's womb and be born
jesus answered verily verily i say unto thee except a man be born of water and of the spirit he cannot enter into the kingdom of god
that which is born of the flesh is flesh and that which is born of the spirit is spirit
marvel not that i said unto thee ye must be born again
the wind bloweth where it listeth and thou hearest the sound thereof but canst not tell whence it cometh and whither it goeth so is every one that is born of the spirit
nicodemus answered and said unto him how can these things be
jesus answered and said unto him art thou a master of israel and knowest not these things
verily verily i say unto thee we speak that we do know and testify that we have seen and ye receive not our witness
if i have told you earthly things and ye believe not how shall ye believe if i tell you of heavenly things
and no man hath ascended up to heaven but he that came down from heaven even the son of man which is in heaven
and as moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness even so must the son of man be lifted up
that whosoever believeth in him should not perish but have eternal life
for god so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son that whosoever believeth in him should not perish but have everlasting life
for god sent not his son into the world to condemn the world but that the world through him might be saved
he that believeth on him is not condemned but he that believeth not is condemned already because he hath not believed in the name of the only begotten son of god
and this is the condemnation that light is come into the world and men loved darkness rather than light because their deeds were evil
for every one that doeth evil hateth the light neither cometh to the light lest his deeds should be reproved
but he that doeth truth cometh to the light that his deeds may be made manifest that they are wrought in god
after these things came jesus and his disciples into the land of judaea and there he tarried with them and baptized
and john also was baptizing in aenon near to salim because there was much water there and they came and were baptized
for john was not yet cast into prison
then there arose a question between some of john's disciples and the jews about purifying
and they came unto john and said unto him rabbi he that was with thee beyond jordan to whom thou barest witness behold the same baptizeth and all men come to him
john answered and said a man can receive nothing except it be given him from heaven
ye yourselves bear me witness that i said i am not the christ but that i am sent before him
he that hath the bride is the bridegroom but the friend of the bridegroom which standeth and heareth him rejoiceth greatly because of the bridegroom's voice this my joy therefore is fulfilled
he must increase but i must decrease
he that cometh from above is above all he that is of the earth is earthly and speaketh of the earth he that cometh from heaven is above all
and what he hath seen and heard that he testifieth and no man receiveth his testimony
he that hath received his testimony hath set to his seal that god is true
for he whom god hath sent speaketh the words of god for god giveth not the spirit by measure unto him
the father loveth the son and hath given all things into his hand
he that believeth on the son hath everlasting life and he that believeth not the son shall not see life but the wrath of god abideth on him
when therefore the lord knew how the pharisees had heard that jesus made and baptized more disciples than john
though jesus himself baptized not but his disciples
he left judaea and departed again into galilee
and he must needs go through samaria
then cometh he to a city of samaria which is called sychar near to the parcel of ground that jacob gave to his son joseph
now jacob's well was there jesus therefore being wearied with his journey sat thus on the well and it was about the sixth hour
there cometh a woman of samaria to draw water jesus saith unto her give me to drink
for his disciples were gone away unto the city to buy meat
then saith the woman of samaria unto him how is it that thou being a jew askest drink of me which am a woman of samaria for the jews have no dealings with the samaritans
jesus answered and said unto her if thou knewest the gift of god and who it is that saith to thee give me to drink thou wouldest have asked of him and he would have given thee living water
the woman saith unto him sir thou hast nothing to draw with and the well is deep from whence then hast thou that living water
art thou greater than our father jacob which gave us the well and drank thereof himself and his children and his cattle
jesus answered and said unto her whosoever drinketh of this water shall thirst again
but whosoever drinketh of the water that i shall give him shall never thirst but the water that i shall give him shall be in him a well of water springing up into everlasting life
the woman saith unto him sir give me this water that i thirst not neither come hither to draw
jesus saith unto her go call thy husband and come hither
the woman answered and said i have no husband jesus said unto her thou hast well said i have no husband
for thou hast had five husbands and he whom thou now hast is not thy husband in that saidst thou truly
the woman saith unto him sir i perceive that thou art a prophet
our fathers worshipped in this mountain and ye say that in jerusalem is the place where men ought to worship
jesus saith unto her woman believe me the hour cometh when ye shall neither in this mountain nor yet at jerusalem worship the father
ye worship ye know not what we know what we worship for salvation is of the jews
but the hour cometh and now is when the true worshippers shall worship the father in spirit and in truth for the father seeketh such to worship him
god is a spirit and they that worship him must worship him in spirit and in truth
the woman saith unto him i know that messias cometh which is called christ when he is come he will tell us all things
jesus saith unto her i that speak unto thee am he
and upon this came his disciples and marvelled that he talked with the woman yet no man said what seekest thou or why talkest thou with her
the woman then left her waterpot and went her way into the city and saith to the men
come see a man which told me all things that ever i did is not this the christ
then they went out of the city and came unto him
in the mean while his disciples prayed him saying master eat
but he said unto them i have meat to eat that ye know not of
therefore said the disciples one to another hath any man brought him ought to eat
jesus saith unto them my meat is to do the will of him that sent me and to finish his work
say not ye there are yet four months and then cometh harvest behold i say unto you lift up your eyes and look on the fields for they are white already to harvest
and he that reapeth receiveth wages and gathereth fruit unto life eternal that both he that soweth and he that reapeth may rejoice together
and herein is that saying true one soweth and another reapeth
i sent you to reap that whereon ye bestowed no labour other men laboured and ye are entered into their labours
and many of the samaritans of that city believed on him for the saying of the woman which testified he told me all that ever i did
so when the samaritans were come unto him they besought him that he would tarry with them and he abode there two days
and many more believed because of his own word
