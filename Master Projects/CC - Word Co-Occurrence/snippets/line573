duke orsino what kind of woman is't
viola of your complexion
duke orsino she is not worth thee then what years i faith
viola about your years my lord
duke orsino too old by heaven let still the woman take
 an elder than herself so wears she to him
 so sways she level in her husband's heart
 for boy however we do praise ourselves
 our fancies are more giddy and unfirm
 more longing wavering sooner lost and worn
 than women's are
viola i think it well my lord
duke orsino then let thy love be younger than thyself
 or thy affection cannot hold the bent
 for women are as roses whose fair flower
 being once display'd doth fall that very hour
viola and so they are alas that they are so
 to die even when they to perfection grow
 reenter curio and clown
duke orsino o fellow come the song we had last night
 mark it cesario it is old and plain
 the spinsters and the knitters in the sun
 and the free maids that weave their thread with bones
 do use to chant it it is silly sooth
 and dallies with the innocence of love
 like the old age
clown are you ready sir
duke orsino ay prithee sing
 music
 
 song
clown come away come away death
 and in sad cypress let me be laid
 fly away fly away breath
 i am slain by a fair cruel maid
 my shroud of white stuck all with yew
 o prepare it
 my part of death no one so true
 did share it
 not a flower not a flower sweet
 on my black coffin let there be strown
 not a friend not a friend greet
 my poor corpse where my bones shall be thrown
 a thousand thousand sighs to save
 lay me o where
 sad true lover never find my grave
 to weep there
duke orsino there's for thy pains
clown no pains sir i take pleasure in singing sir
duke orsino i'll pay thy pleasure then
clown truly sir and pleasure will be paid one time or another
duke orsino give me now leave to leave thee
clown now the melancholy god protect thee and the
 tailor make thy doublet of changeable taffeta for
 thy mind is a very opal i would have men of such
 constancy put to sea that their business might be
 every thing and their intent every where for that's
 it that always makes a good voyage of nothing farewell
 exit
duke orsino let all the rest give place
 curio and attendants retire
 once more cesario
 get thee to yond same sovereign cruelty
 tell her my love more noble than the world
 prizes not quantity of dirty lands
 the parts that fortune hath bestow'd upon her
 tell her i hold as giddily as fortune
 but tis that miracle and queen of gems
 that nature pranks her in attracts my soul
viola but if she cannot love you sir
duke orsino i cannot be so answer'd
viola sooth but you must
 say that some lady as perhaps there is
 hath for your love a great a pang of heart
 as you have for olivia you cannot love her
 you tell her so must she not then be answer'd
duke orsino there is no woman's sides
 can bide the beating of so strong a passion
 as love doth give my heart no woman's heart
 so big to hold so much they lack retention
 alas their love may be call'd appetite
 no motion of the liver but the palate
 that suffer surfeit cloyment and revolt
 but mine is all as hungry as the sea
 and can digest as much make no compare
 between that love a woman can bear me
 and that i owe olivia
viola ay but i know
duke orsino what dost thou know
viola too well what love women to men may owe
 in faith they are as true of heart as we
 my father had a daughter loved a man
 as it might be perhaps were i a woman
 i should your lordship
duke orsino and what's her history
viola a blank my lord she never told her love
 but let concealment like a worm i the bud
 feed on her damask cheek she pined in thought
 and with a green and yellow melancholy
 she sat like patience on a monument
 smiling at grief was not this love indeed
 we men may say more swear more but indeed
 our shows are more than will for still we prove
 much in our vows but little in our love
duke orsino but died thy sister of her love my boy
viola i am all the daughters of my father's house
 and all the brothers too and yet i know not
 sir shall i to this lady
duke orsino ay that's the theme
 to her in haste give her this jewel say
 my love can give no place bide no denay
 exeunt
