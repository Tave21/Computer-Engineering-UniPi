 when my dimensions are as well compact
 my mind as generous and my shape as true
 as honest madam's issue why brand they us
 with base with baseness bastardy base base
 who in the lusty stealth of nature take
 more composition and fierce quality
 than doth within a dull stale tired bed
 go to the creating a whole tribe of fops
 got tween asleep and wake well then
 legitimate edgar i must have your land
 our father's love is to the bastard edmund
 as to the legitimate fine wordlegitimate
 well my legitimate if this letter speed
 and my invention thrive edmund the base
 shall top the legitimate i grow i prosper
 now gods stand up for bastards
 enter gloucester
gloucester kent banish'd thus and france in choler parted
 and the king gone tonight subscribed his power
 confined to exhibition all this done
 upon the gad edmund how now what news
edmund so please your lordship none
 putting up the letter
gloucester why so earnestly seek you to put up that letter
edmund i know no news my lord
gloucester what paper were you reading
edmund nothing my lord
gloucester no what needed then that terrible dispatch of
 it into your pocket the quality of nothing hath
 not such need to hide itself let's see come
 if it be nothing i shall not need spectacles
edmund i beseech you sir pardon me it is a letter
 from my brother that i have not all o'erread
 and for so much as i have perused i find it not
 fit for your o'erlooking
gloucester give me the letter sir
edmund i shall offend either to detain or give it the
 contents as in part i understand them are to blame
gloucester let's see let's see
edmund i hope for my brother's justification he wrote
 this but as an essay or taste of my virtue
gloucester reads this policy and reverence of age makes
 the world bitter to the best of our times keeps
 our fortunes from us till our oldness cannot relish
 them i begin to find an idle and fond bondage
 in the oppression of aged tyranny who sways not
 as it hath power but as it is suffered come to
 me that of this i may speak more if our father
 would sleep till i waked him you should half his
 revenue for ever and live the beloved of your
 brother edgar'
 humconspiracy'sleep till i waked himyou
 should enjoy half his revenue'my son edgar
 had he a hand to write this a heart and brain
 to breed it inwhen came this to you who
 brought it
edmund it was not brought me my lord there's the
 cunning of it i found it thrown in at the
 casement of my closet
gloucester you know the character to be your brother's
edmund if the matter were good my lord i durst swear
 it were his but in respect of that i would
 fain think it were not
gloucester it is his
edmund it is his hand my lord but i hope his heart is
 not in the contents
gloucester hath he never heretofore sounded you in this business
edmund never my lord but i have heard him oft
 maintain it to be fit that sons at perfect age
 and fathers declining the father should be as
 ward to the son and the son manage his revenue
gloucester o villain villain his very opinion in the
 letter abhorred villain unnatural detested
 brutish villain worse than brutish go sirrah
 seek him i'll apprehend him abominable villain
 where is he
edmund i do not well know my lord if it shall please
 you to suspend your indignation against my
 brother till you can derive from him better
 testimony of his intent you shall run a certain
 course where if you violently proceed against
 him mistaking his purpose it would make a great
 gap in your own honour and shake in pieces the
 heart of his obedience i dare pawn down my life
 for him that he hath wrote this to feel my
 affection to your honour and to no further
 pretence of danger
gloucester think you so
edmund if your honour judge it meet i will place you
 where you shall hear us confer of this and by an
 auricular assurance have your satisfaction and
 that without any further delay than this very evening
gloucester he cannot be such a monster
edmund nor is not sure
gloucester to his father that so tenderly and entirely
 loves him heaven and earth edmund seek him
 out wind me into him i pray you frame the
 business after your own wisdom i would unstate
 myself to be in a due resolution
edmund i will seek him sir presently convey the
 business as i shall find means and acquaint you withal
gloucester these late eclipses in the sun and moon portend
 no good to us though the wisdom of nature can
 reason it thus and thus yet nature finds itself
 scourged by the sequent effects love cools
 friendship falls off brothers divide in
 cities mutinies in countries discord in
 palaces treason and the bond cracked twixt son
 and father this villain of mine comes under the
 prediction there's son against father the king
 falls from bias of nature there's father against
 child we have seen the best of our time
 machinations hollowness treachery and all
 ruinous disorders follow us disquietly to our
 graves find out this villain edmund it shall
 lose thee nothing do it carefully and the
 noble and truehearted kent banished his
 offence honesty tis strange
 exit
edmund this is the excellent foppery of the world that
 when we are sick in fortuneoften the surfeit
 of our own behaviorwe make guilty of our
 disasters the sun the moon and the stars as
 if we were villains by necessity fools by
 heavenly compulsion knaves thieves and
 treachers by spherical predominance drunkards
 liars and adulterers by an enforced obedience of
 planetary influence and all that we are evil in
 by a divine thrusting on an admirable evasion
 of whoremaster man to lay his goatish
 disposition to the charge of a star my
 father compounded with my mother under the
 dragon's tail and my nativity was under ursa
 major so that it follows i am rough and
 lecherous tut i should have been that i am
 had the maidenliest star in the firmament
 twinkled on my bastardizing edgar
 enter edgar
 and pat he comes like the catastrophe of the old
 comedy my cue is villanous melancholy with a
 sigh like tom o bedlam o these eclipses do
 portend these divisions fa sol la mi
edgar how now brother edmund what serious
 contemplation are you in
edmund i am thinking brother of a prediction i read
 this other day what should follow these eclipses
edgar do you busy yourself about that
edmund i promise you the effects he writes of succeed
 unhappily as of unnaturalness between the child
 and the parent death dearth dissolutions of
 ancient amities divisions in state menaces and
 maledictions against king and nobles needless
 diffidences banishment of friends dissipation
 of cohorts nuptial breaches and i know not what
edgar how long have you been a sectary astronomical
edmund come come when saw you my father last
edgar why the night gone by
edmund spake you with him
edgar ay two hours together
edmund parted you in good terms found you no
 displeasure in him by word or countenance
edgar none at all
edmund bethink yourself wherein you may have offended
 him and at my entreaty forbear his presence
 till some little time hath qualified the heat of
 his displeasure which at this instant so rageth
 in him that with the mischief of your person it
 would scarcely allay
edgar some villain hath done me wrong
edmund that's my fear i pray you have a continent
 forbearance till the spied of his rage goes
 slower and as i say retire with me to my
 lodging from whence i will fitly bring you to
 hear my lord speak pray ye go there's my key
 if you do stir abroad go armed
edgar armed brother
edmund brother i advise you to the best go armed i
 am no honest man if there be any good meaning
 towards you i have told you what i have seen
 and heard but faintly nothing like the image
 and horror of it pray you away
edgar shall i hear from you anon
edmund i do serve you in this business
 exit edgar
 a credulous father and a brother noble
 whose nature is so far from doing harms
 that he suspects none on whose foolish honesty
 my practises ride easy i see the business
 let me if not by birth have lands by wit
 all with me's meet that i can fashion fit
