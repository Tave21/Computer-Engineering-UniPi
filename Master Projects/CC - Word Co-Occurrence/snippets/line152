1pet124 for all flesh is as grass and all the glory of man as the flower of grass the grass withereth and the flower thereof falleth away
1pet125 but the word of the lord endureth for ever and this is the word which by the gospel is preached unto you
1pet21 wherefore laying aside all malice and all guile and hypocrisies and envies and all evil speakings
1pet22 as newborn babes desire the sincere milk of the word that ye may grow thereby
1pet23 if so be ye have tasted that the lord is gracious
1pet24 to whom coming as unto a living stone disallowed indeed of men but chosen of god and precious
1pet25 ye also as lively stones are built up a spiritual house an holy priesthood to offer up spiritual sacrifices acceptable to god by jesus christ
1pet26 wherefore also it is contained in the scripture behold i lay in sion a chief corner stone elect precious and he that believeth on him shall not be confounded
1pet27 unto you therefore which believe he is precious but unto them which be disobedient the stone which the builders disallowed the same is made the head of the corner
1pet28 and a stone of stumbling and a rock of offence even to them which stumble at the word being disobedient whereunto also they were appointed
1pet29 but ye are a chosen generation a royal priesthood an holy nation a peculiar people that ye should shew forth the praises of him who hath called you out of darkness into his marvellous light
1pet210 which in time past were not a people but are now the people of god which had not obtained mercy but now have obtained mercy
1pet211 dearly beloved i beseech you as strangers and pilgrims abstain from fleshly lusts which war against the soul
1pet212 having your conversation honest among the gentiles that whereas they speak against you as evildoers they may by your good works which they shall behold glorify god in the day of visitation
1pet213 submit yourselves to every ordinance of man for the lord's sake whether it be to the king as supreme
1pet214 or unto governors as unto them that are sent by him for the punishment of evildoers and for the praise of them that do well
1pet215 for so is the will of god that with well doing ye may put to silence the ignorance of foolish men
1pet216 as free and not using your liberty for a cloke of maliciousness but as the servants of god
1pet217 honour all men love the brotherhood fear god honour the king
1pet218 servants be subject to your masters with all fear not only to the good and gentle but also to the froward
1pet219 for this is thankworthy if a man for conscience toward god endure grief suffering wrongfully
1pet220 for what glory is it if when ye be buffeted for your faults ye shall take it patiently but if when ye do well and suffer for it ye take it patiently this is acceptable with god
1pet221 for even hereunto were ye called because christ also suffered for us leaving us an example that ye should follow his steps
1pet222 who did no sin neither was guile found in his mouth
1pet223 who when he was reviled reviled not again when he suffered he threatened not but committed himself to him that judgeth righteously
1pet224 who his own self bare our sins in his own body on the tree that we being dead to sins should live unto righteousness by whose stripes ye were healed
1pet225 for ye were as sheep going astray but are now returned unto the shepherd and bishop of your souls
1pet31 likewise ye wives be in subjection to your own husbands that if any obey not the word they also may without the word be won by the conversation of the wives
1pet32 while they behold your chaste conversation coupled with fear
1pet33 whose adorning let it not be that outward adorning of plaiting the hair and of wearing of gold or of putting on of apparel
1pet34 but let it be the hidden man of the heart in that which is not corruptible even the ornament of a meek and quiet spirit which is in the sight of god of great price
1pet35 for after this manner in the old time the holy women also who trusted in god adorned themselves being in subjection unto their own husbands
1pet36 even as sara obeyed abraham calling him lord whose daughters ye are as long as ye do well and are not afraid with any amazement
1pet37 likewise ye husbands dwell with them according to knowledge giving honour unto the wife as unto the weaker vessel and as being heirs together of the grace of life that your prayers be not hindered
1pet38 finally be ye all of one mind having compassion one of another love as brethren be pitiful be courteous
1pet39 not rendering evil for evil or railing for railing but contrariwise blessing knowing that ye are thereunto called that ye should inherit a blessing
1pet310 for he that will love life and see good days let him refrain his tongue from evil and his lips that they speak no guile
1pet311 let him eschew evil and do good let him seek peace and ensue it
1pet312 for the eyes of the lord are over the righteous and his ears are open unto their prayers but the face of the lord is against them that do evil
1pet313 and who is he that will harm you if ye be followers of that which is good
1pet314 but and if ye suffer for righteousness sake happy are ye and be not afraid of their terror neither be troubled
1pet315 but sanctify the lord god in your hearts and be ready always to give an answer to every man that asketh you a reason of the hope that is in you with meekness and fear
1pet316 having a good conscience that whereas they speak evil of you as of evildoers they may be ashamed that falsely accuse your good conversation in christ
1pet317 for it is better if the will of god be so that ye suffer for well doing than for evil doing
1pet318 for christ also hath once suffered for sins the just for the unjust that he might bring us to god being put to death in the flesh but quickened by the spirit
1pet319 by which also he went and preached unto the spirits in prison
1pet320 which sometime were disobedient when once the longsuffering of god waited in the days of noah while the ark was a preparing wherein few that is eight souls were saved by water
1pet321 the like figure whereunto even baptism doth also now save us not the putting away of the filth of the flesh but the answer of a good conscience toward god by the resurrection of jesus christ
1pet322 who is gone into heaven and is on the right hand of god angels and authorities and powers being made subject unto him
1pet41 forasmuch then as christ hath suffered for us in the flesh arm yourselves likewise with the same mind for he that hath suffered in the flesh hath ceased from sin
1pet42 that he no longer should live the rest of his time in the flesh to the lusts of men but to the will of god
1pet43 for the time past of our life may suffice us to have wrought the will of the gentiles when we walked in lasciviousness lusts excess of wine revellings banquetings and abominable idolatries
1pet44 wherein they think it strange that ye run not with them to the same excess of riot speaking evil of you
1pet45 who shall give account to him that is ready to judge the quick and the dead
1pet46 for for this cause was the gospel preached also to them that are dead that they might be judged according to men in the flesh but live according to god in the spirit
1pet47 but the end of all things is at hand be ye therefore sober and watch unto prayer
1pet48 and above all things have fervent charity among yourselves for charity shall cover the multitude of sins
1pet49 use hospitality one to another without grudging
1pet410 as every man hath received the gift even so minister the same one to another as good stewards of the manifold grace of god
1pet411 if any man speak let him speak as the oracles of god if any man minister let him do it as of the ability which god giveth that god in all things may be glorified through jesus christ to whom be praise and dominion for ever and ever amen
1pet412 beloved think it not strange concerning the fiery trial which is to try you as though some strange thing happened unto you
1pet413 but rejoice inasmuch as ye are partakers of christ's sufferings that when his glory shall be revealed ye may be glad also with exceeding joy
1pet414 if ye be reproached for the name of christ happy are ye for the spirit of glory and of god resteth upon you on their part he is evil spoken of but on your part he is glorified
1pet415 but let none of you suffer as a murderer or as a thief or as an evildoer or as a busybody in other men's matters
1pet416 yet if any man suffer as a christian let him not be ashamed but let him glorify god on this behalf
1pet417 for the time is come that judgment must begin at the house of god and if it first begin at us what shall the end be of them that obey not the gospel of god
1pet418 and if the righteous scarcely be saved where shall the ungodly and the sinner appear
1pet419 wherefore let them that suffer according to the will of god commit the keeping of their souls to him in well doing as unto a faithful creator
1pet51 the elders which are among you i exhort who am also an elder and a witness of the sufferings of christ and also a partaker of the glory that shall be revealed
1pet52 feed the flock of god which is among you taking the oversight thereof not by constraint but willingly not for filthy lucre but of a ready mind
1pet53 neither as being lords over god's heritage but being ensamples to the flock
1pet54 and when the chief shepherd shall appear ye shall receive a crown of glory that fadeth not away
1pet55 likewise ye younger submit yourselves unto the elder yea all of you be subject one to another and be clothed with humility for god resisteth the proud and giveth grace to the humble
1pet56 humble yourselves therefore under the mighty hand of god that he may exalt you in due time
1pet57 casting all your care upon him for he careth for you
1pet58 be sober be vigilant because your adversary the devil as a roaring lion walketh about seeking whom he may devour
1pet59 whom resist stedfast in the faith knowing that the same afflictions are accomplished in your brethren that are in the world
1pet510 but the god of all grace who hath called us unto his eternal glory by christ jesus after that ye have suffered a while make you perfect stablish strengthen settle you
1pet511 to him be glory and dominion for ever and ever amen
1pet512 by silvanus a faithful brother unto you as i suppose i have written briefly exhorting and testifying that this is the true grace of god wherein ye stand
1pet513 the church that is at babylon elected together with you saluteth you and so doth marcus my son
1pet514 greet ye one another with a kiss of charity peace be with you all that are in christ jesus amen
2pet11 simon peter a servant and an apostle of jesus christ to them that have obtained like precious faith with us through the righteousness of god and our saviour jesus christ
2pet12 grace and peace be multiplied unto you through the knowledge of god and of jesus our lord
2pet13 according as his divine power hath given unto us all things that pertain unto life and godliness through the knowledge of him that hath called us to glory and virtue
2pet14 whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises that by these ye might be partakers of the divine nature having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust
2pet15 and beside this giving all diligence add to your faith virtue and to virtue knowledge
2pet16 and to knowledge temperance and to temperance patience and to patience godliness
2pet17 and to godliness brotherly kindness and to brotherly kindness charity
2pet18 for if these things be in you and abound they make you that ye shall neither be barren nor unfruitful in the knowledge of our lord jesus christ
2pet19 but he that lacketh these things is blind and cannot see afar off and hath forgotten that he was purged from his old sins
2pet110 wherefore the rather brethren give diligence to make your calling and election sure for if ye do these things ye shall never fall
2pet111 for so an entrance shall be ministered unto you abundantly into the everlasting kingdom of our lord and saviour jesus christ
2pet112 wherefore i will not be negligent to put you always in remembrance of these things though ye know them and be established in the present truth
2pet113 yea i think it meet as long as i am in this tabernacle to stir you up by putting you in remembrance
2pet114 knowing that shortly i must put off this my tabernacle even as our lord jesus christ hath shewed me
2pet115 moreover i will endeavour that ye may be able after my decease to have these things always in remembrance
2pet116 for we have not followed cunningly devised fables when we made known unto you the power and coming of our lord jesus christ but were eyewitnesses of his majesty
2pet117 for he received from god the father honour and glory when there came such a voice to him from the excellent glory this is my beloved son in whom i am well pleased
2pet118 and this voice which came from heaven we heard when we were with him in the holy mount
2pet119 we have also a more sure word of prophecy whereunto ye do well that ye take heed as unto a light that shineth in a dark place until the day dawn and the day star arise in your hearts
2pet120 knowing this first that no prophecy of the scripture is of any private interpretation
2pet121 for the prophecy came not in old time by the will of man but holy men of god spake as they were moved by the holy ghost
2pet21 but there were false prophets also among the people even as there shall be false teachers among you who privily shall bring in damnable heresies even denying the lord that bought them and bring upon themselves swift destruction
2pet22 and many shall follow their pernicious ways by reason of whom the way of truth shall be evil spoken of
2pet23 and through covetousness shall they with feigned words make merchandise of you whose judgment now of a long time lingereth not and their damnation slumbereth not
2pet24 for if god spared not the angels that sinned but cast them down to hell and delivered them into chains of darkness to be reserved unto judgment
2pet25 and spared not the old world but saved noah the eighth person a preacher of righteousness bringing in the flood upon the world of the ungodly
2pet26 and turning the cities of sodom and gomorrha into ashes condemned them with an overthrow making them an ensample unto those that after should live ungodly
2pet27 and delivered just lot vexed with the filthy conversation of the wicked
2pet28 for that righteous man dwelling among them in seeing and hearing vexed his righteous soul from day to day with their unlawful deeds
2pet29 the lord knoweth how to deliver the godly out of temptations and to reserve the unjust unto the day of judgment to be punished
2pet210 but chiefly them that walk after the flesh in the lust of uncleanness and despise government presumptuous are they selfwilled they are not afraid to speak evil of dignities
2pet211 whereas angels which are greater in power and might bring not railing accusation against them before the lord
2pet212 but these as natural brute beasts made to be taken and destroyed speak evil of the things that they understand not and shall utterly perish in their own corruption
2pet213 and shall receive the reward of unrighteousness as they that count it pleasure to riot in the day time spots they are and blemishes sporting themselves with their own deceivings while they feast with you
2pet214 having eyes full of adultery and that cannot cease from sin beguiling unstable souls an heart they have exercised with covetous practices cursed children
2pet215 which have forsaken the right way and are gone astray following the way of balaam the son of bosor who loved the wages of unrighteousness
2pet216 but was rebuked for his iniquity the dumb ass speaking with man's voice forbad the madness of the prophet
2pet217 these are wells without water clouds that are carried with a tempest to whom the mist of darkness is reserved for ever
2pet218 for when they speak great swelling words of vanity they allure through the lusts of the flesh through much wantonness those that were clean escaped from them who live in error
2pet219 while they promise them liberty they themselves are the servants of corruption for of whom a man is overcome of the same is he brought in bondage
2pet220 for if after they have escaped the pollutions of the world through the knowledge of the lord and saviour jesus christ they are again entangled therein and overcome the latter end is worse with them than the beginning
2pet221 for it had been better for them not to have known the way of righteousness than after they have known it to turn from the holy commandment delivered unto them
2pet222 but it is happened unto them according to the true proverb the dog is turned to his own vomit again and the sow that was washed to her wallowing in the mire
2pet31 this second epistle beloved i now write unto you in both which i stir up your pure minds by way of remembrance
2pet32 that ye may be mindful of the words which were spoken before by the holy prophets and of the commandment of us the apostles of the lord and saviour
2pet33 knowing this first that there shall come in the last days scoffers walking after their own lusts
2pet34 and saying where is the promise of his coming for since the fathers fell asleep all things continue as they were from the beginning of the creation
2pet35 for this they willingly are ignorant of that by the word of god the heavens were of old and the earth standing out of the water and in the water
2pet36 whereby the world that then was being overflowed with water perished
2pet37 but the heavens and the earth which are now by the same word are kept in store reserved unto fire against the day of judgment and perdition of ungodly men
2pet38 but beloved be not ignorant of this one thing that one day is with the lord as a thousand years and a thousand years as one day
2pet39 the lord is not slack concerning his promise as some men count slackness but is longsuffering to usward not willing that any should perish but that all should come to repentance
2pet310 but the day of the lord will come as a thief in the night in the which the heavens shall pass away with a great noise and the elements shall melt with fervent heat the earth also and the works that are therein shall be burned up
2pet311 seeing then that all these things shall be dissolved what manner of persons ought ye to be in all holy conversation and godliness
2pet312 looking for and hasting unto the coming of the day of god wherein the heavens being on fire shall be dissolved and the elements shall melt with fervent heat
2pet313 nevertheless we according to his promise look for new heavens and a new earth wherein dwelleth righteousness
2pet314 wherefore beloved seeing that ye look for such things be diligent that ye may be found of him in peace without spot and blameless
2pet315 and account that the longsuffering of our lord is salvation even as our beloved brother paul also according to the wisdom given unto him hath written unto you
2pet316 as also in all his epistles speaking in them of these things in which are some things hard to be understood which they that are unlearned and unstable wrest as they do also the other scriptures unto their own destruction
2pet317 ye therefore beloved seeing ye know these things before beware lest ye also being led away with the error of the wicked fall from your own stedfastness
2pet318 but grow in grace and in the knowledge of our lord and saviour jesus christ to him be glory both now and for ever amen
1jn11 that which was from the beginning which we have heard which we have seen with our eyes which we have looked upon and our hands have handled of the word of life
1jn12 for the life was manifested and we have seen it and bear witness and shew unto you that eternal life which was with the father and was manifested unto us
1jn13 that which we have seen and heard declare we unto you that ye also may have fellowship with us and truly our fellowship is with the father and with his son jesus christ
1jn14 and these things write we unto you that your joy may be full
1jn15 this then is the message which we have heard of him and declare unto you that god is light and in him is no darkness at all
1jn16 if we say that we have fellowship with him and walk in darkness we lie and do not the truth
1jn17 but if we walk in the light as he is in the light we have fellowship one with another and the blood of jesus christ his son cleanseth us from all sin
1jn18 if we say that we have no sin we deceive ourselves and the truth is not in us
1jn19 if we confess our sins he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness
1jn110 if we say that we have not sinned we make him a liar and his word is not in us
1jn21 my little children these things write i unto you that ye sin not and if any man sin we have an advocate with the father jesus christ the righteous
1jn22 and he is the propitiation for our sins and not for ours only but also for the sins of the whole world
1jn23 and hereby we do know that we know him if we keep his commandments
1jn24 he that saith i know him and keepeth not his commandments is a liar and the truth is not in him
1jn25 but whoso keepeth his word in him verily is the love of god perfected hereby know we that we are in him
1jn26 he that saith he abideth in him ought himself also so to walk even as he walked
1jn27 brethren i write no new commandment unto you but an old commandment which ye had from the beginning the old commandment is the word which ye have heard from the beginning
1jn28 again a new commandment i write unto you which thing is true in him and in you because the darkness is past and the true light now shineth
1jn29 he that saith he is in the light and hateth his brother is in darkness even until now
1jn210 he that loveth his brother abideth in the light and there is none occasion of stumbling in him
1jn211 but he that hateth his brother is in darkness and walketh in darkness and knoweth not whither he goeth because that darkness hath blinded his eyes
1jn212 i write unto you little children because your sins are forgiven you for his name's sake
1jn213 i write unto you fathers because ye have known him that is from the beginning i write unto you young men because ye have overcome the wicked one i write unto you little children because ye have known the father
1jn214 i have written unto you fathers because ye have known him that is from the beginning i have written unto you young men because ye are strong and the word of god abideth in you and ye have overcome the wicked one
1jn215 love not the world neither the things that are in the world if any man love the world the love of the father is not in him
1jn216 for all that is in the world the lust of the flesh and the lust of the eyes and the pride of life is not of the father but is of the world
1jn217 and the world passeth away and the lust thereof but he that doeth the will of god abideth for ever
1jn218 little children it is the last time and as ye have heard that antichrist shall come even now are there many antichrists whereby we know that it is the last time
1jn219 they went out from us but they were not of us for if they had been of us they would no doubt have continued with us but they went out that they might be made manifest that they were not all of us
1jn220 but ye have an unction from the holy one and ye know all things
1jn221 i have not written unto you because ye know not the truth but because ye know it and that no lie is of the truth
1jn222 who is a liar but he that denieth that jesus is the christ he is antichrist that denieth the father and the son
1jn223 whosoever denieth the son the same hath not the father he that acknowledgeth the son hath the father also
1jn224 let that therefore abide in you which ye have heard from the beginning if that which ye have heard from the beginning shall remain in you ye also shall continue in the son and in the father
1jn225 and this is the promise that he hath promised us even eternal life
1jn226 these things have i written unto you concerning them that seduce you
1jn227 but the anointing which ye have received of him abideth in you and ye need not that any man teach you but as the same anointing teacheth you of all things and is truth and is no lie and even as it hath taught you ye shall abide in him
1jn228 and now little children abide in him that when he shall appear we may have confidence and not be ashamed before him at his coming
1jn229 if ye know that he is righteous ye know that every one that doeth righteousness is born of him
1jn31 behold what manner of love the father hath bestowed upon us that we should be called the sons of god therefore the world knoweth us not because it knew him not
1jn32 beloved now are we the sons of god and it doth not yet appear what we shall be but we know that when he shall appear we shall be like him for we shall see him as he is
1jn33 and every man that hath this hope in him purifieth himself even as he is pure
1jn34 whosoever committeth sin transgresseth also the law for sin is the transgression of the law
1jn35 and ye know that he was manifested to take away our sins and in him is no sin
1jn36 whosoever abideth in him sinneth not whosoever sinneth hath not seen him neither known him
1jn37 little children let no man deceive you he that doeth righteousness is righteous even as he is righteous
1jn38 he that committeth sin is of the devil for the devil sinneth from the beginning for this purpose the son of god was manifested that he might destroy the works of the devil
1jn39 whosoever is born of god doth not commit sin for his seed remaineth in him and he cannot sin because he is born of god
1jn310 in this the children of god are manifest and the children of the devil whosoever doeth not righteousness is not of god neither he that loveth not his brother
1jn311 for this is the message that ye heard from the beginning that we should love one another
1jn312 not as cain who was of that wicked one and slew his brother and wherefore slew he him because his own works were evil and his brother's righteous
1jn313 marvel not my brethren if the world hate you
1jn314 we know that we have passed from death unto life because we love the brethren he that loveth not his brother abideth in death
1jn315 whosoever hateth his brother is a murderer and ye know that no murderer hath eternal life abiding in him
1jn316 hereby perceive we the love of god because he laid down his life for us and we ought to lay down our lives for the brethren
1jn317 but whoso hath this world's good and seeth his brother have need and shutteth up his bowels of compassion from him how dwelleth the love of god in him
1jn318 my little children let us not love in word neither in tongue but in deed and in truth
