 potatofinger tickles these together fry lechery fry

diomedes give me some token for the surety of it
cressida i'll fetch you one

cressida you look upon that sleeve behold it well

diomedes whose was't
cressida it is no matter now i have't again

 i prithee diomed visit me no more
thersites now she sharpens well said whetstone
diomedes i shall have it
cressida what this
diomedes ay that
cressida o all you gods o pretty pretty pledge
 thy master now lies thinking in his bed
 of thee and me and sighs and takes my glove
 and gives memorial dainty kisses to it
 as i kiss thee nay do not snatch it from me
 he that takes that doth take my heart withal
diomedes i had your heart before this follows it
troilus i did swear patience

diomedes farewell till then
cressida good night i prithee come
 exit diomedes
 troilus farewell one eye yet looks on thee
 but with my heart the other eye doth see
 ah poor our sex this fault in us i find
 the error of our eye directs our mind
 what error leads must err o then conclude
 minds sway'd by eyes are full of turpitude
 exit
thersites a proof of strength she could not publish more
 unless she said  my mind is now turn'd whore'
ulysses all's done my lord
troilus it is
ulysses why stay we then
troilus to make a recordation to my soul
 of every syllable that here was spoke
 but if i tell how these two did coact
 shall i not lie in publishing a truth
 sith yet there is a credence in my heart
 an esperance so obstinately strong
 that doth invert the attest of eyes and ears
 as if those organs had deceptious functions
 created only to calumniate
 was cressid here
ulysses i cannot conjure trojan
troilus she was not sure
ulysses most sure she was
troilus why my negation hath no taste of madness
ulysses nor mine my lord cressid was here but now
troilus let it not be believed for womanhood
 think we had mothers do not give advantage
 to stubborn critics apt without a theme
 for depravation to square the general sex
 by cressid's rule rather think this not cressid
ulysses what hath she done prince that can soil our mothers
troilus nothing at all unless that this were she
thersites will he swagger himself out on's own eyes
troilus this she no this is diomed's cressida
 if beauty have a soul this is not she
 if souls guide vows if vows be sanctimonies
 if sanctimony be the gods delight
 if there be rule in unity itself
 this is not she o madness of discourse
 that cause sets up with and against itself
 bifold authority where reason can revolt
 without perdition and loss assume all reason
 without revolt this is and is not cressid
 within my soul there doth conduce a fight
 of this strange nature that a thing inseparate
 divides more wider than the sky and earth
 and yet the spacious breadth of this division
 admits no orifex for a point as subtle
 as ariachne's broken woof to enter
 instance o instance strong as pluto's gates
 cressid is mine tied with the bonds of heaven
 instance o instance strong as heaven itself
 the bonds of heaven are slipp'd dissolved and loosed
 and with another knot fivefingertied
 the fractions of her faith orts of her love
 the fragments scraps the bits and greasy relics
 of her o'ereaten faith are bound to diomed
ulysses may worthy troilus be half attach'd
 with that which here his passion doth express
troilus ay greek and that shall be divulged well
 in characters as red as mars his heart
 inflamed with venus never did young man fancy
 with so eternal and so fix'd a soul
 hark greek as much as i do cressid love
 so much by weight hate i her diomed
 that sleeve is mine that he'll bear on his helm
 were it a casque composed by vulcan's skill
 my sword should bite it not the dreadful spout
 which shipmen do the hurricano call
 constringed in mass by the almighty sun
 shall dizzy with more clamour neptune's ear
 in his descent than shall my prompted sword
 falling on diomed
thersites he'll tickle it for his concupy
troilus o cressid o false cressid false false false
 let all untruths stand by thy stained name
 and they'll seem glorious
ulysses o contain yourself
 your passion draws ears hither
 enter aeneas
aeneas i have been seeking you this hour my lord
 hector by this is arming him in troy
 ajax your guard stays to conduct you home
troilus have with you prince my courteous lord adieu
 farewell revolted fair and diomed
 stand fast and wear a castle on thy head
ulysses i'll bring you to the gates
troilus accept distracted thanks
 exeunt troilus aeneas and ulysses
thersites would i could meet that rogue diomed i would
 croak like a raven i would bode i would bode
 patroclus will give me any thing for the
 intelligence of this whore the parrot will not
 do more for an almond than he for a commodious drab
 lechery lechery still wars and lechery nothing
 else holds fashion a burning devil take them
 exit
 troilus and cressida
act v
scene iii troy before priam's palace
 enter hector and andromache
andromache when was my lord so much ungently temper'd
 to stop his ears against admonishment
 unarm unarm and do not fight today
hector you train me to offend you get you in
 by all the everlasting gods i'll go
andromache my dreams will sure prove ominous to the day
hector no more i say
 enter cassandra
cassandra where is my brother hector
andromache here sister arm'd and bloody in intent
