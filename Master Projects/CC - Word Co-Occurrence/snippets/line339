shed for the slaughter'd husband by the wife
the red blood reek'd to show the painter's strife
and dying eyes gleam'd forth their ashy lights
like dying coals burnt out in tedious nights
there might you see the labouring pioner
begrimed with sweat and smeared all with dust
and from the towers of troy there would appear
the very eyes of men through loopholes thrust
gazing upon the greeks with little lust
such sweet observance in this work was had
that one might see those faroff eyes look sad
in great commanders grace and majesty
you might behold triumphing in their faces
in youth quick bearing and dexterity
pale cowards marching on with trembling paces
which heartless peasants did so well resemble
that one would swear he saw them quake and tremble
in ajax and ulysses o what art
of physiognomy might one behold
the face of either cipher'd either's heart
their face their manners most expressly told
in ajax eyes blunt rage and rigor roll'd
but the mild glance that sly ulysses lent
show'd deep regard and smiling government
there pleading might you see grave nestor stand
as twere encouraging the greeks to fight
making such sober action with his hand
that it beguiled attention charm'd the sight
in speech it seem'd his beard all silver white
wagg'd up and down and from his lips did fly
thin winding breath which purl'd up to the sky
about him were a press of gaping faces
which seem'd to swallow up his sound advice
all jointly listening but with several graces
as if some mermaid did their ears entice
some high some low the painter was so nice
the scalps of many almost hid behind
to jump up higher seem'd to mock the mind
here one man's hand lean'd on another's head
his nose being shadow'd by his neighbour's ear
here one being throng'd bears back all boll'n and
red
another smother'd seems to pelt and swear
and in their rage such signs of rage they bear
as but for loss of nestor's golden words
it seem'd they would debate with angry swords
for much imaginary work was there
conceit deceitful so compact so kind
that for achilles image stood his spear
griped in an armed hand himself behind
was left unseen save to the eye of mind
a hand a foot a face a leg a head
stood for the whole to be imagined
and from the walls of strongbesieged troy
when their brave hope bold hector march'd to
field
stood many trojan mothers sharing joy
to see their youthful sons bright weapons wield
and to their hope they such odd action yield
that through their light joy seemed to appear
like bright things stain'd a kind of heavy fear
and from the strand of dardan where they fought
to simois reedy banks the red blood ran
whose waves to imitate the battle sought
with swelling ridges and their ranks began
to break upon the galled shore and than
retire again till meeting greater ranks
they join and shoot their foam at simois banks
to this wellpainted piece is lucrece come
to find a face where all distress is stell'd
many she sees where cares have carved some
but none where all distress and dolour dwell'd
till she despairing hecuba beheld
staring on priam's wounds with her old eyes
which bleeding under pyrrhus proud foot lies
in her the painter had anatomized
time's ruin beauty's wreck and grim care's reign
her cheeks with chaps and wrinkles were disguised
of what she was no semblance did remain
her blue blood changed to black in every vein
wanting the spring that those shrunk pipes had fed
show'd life imprison'd in a body dead
on this sad shadow lucrece spends her eyes
and shapes her sorrow to the beldam's woes
who nothing wants to answer her but cries
and bitter words to ban her cruel foes
the painter was no god to lend her those
and therefore lucrece swears he did her wrong
to give her so much grief and not a tongue
'poor instrument quoth she'without a sound
i'll tune thy woes with my lamenting tongue
and drop sweet balm in priam's painted wound
and rail on pyrrhus that hath done him wrong
and with my tears quench troy that burns so long
and with my knife scratch out the angry eyes
of all the greeks that are thine enemies
'show me the strumpet that began this stir
that with my nails her beauty i may tear
thy heat of lust fond paris did incur
this load of wrath that burning troy doth bear
thy eye kindled the fire that burneth here
and here in troy for trespass of thine eye
the sire the son the dame and daughter die
'why should the private pleasure of some one
become the public plague of many moe
let sin alone committed light alone
upon his head that hath transgressed so
let guiltless souls be freed from guilty woe
for one's offence why should so many fall
to plague a private sin in general
'lo here weeps hecuba here priam dies
here manly hector faints here troilus swounds
here friend by friend in bloody channel lies
and friend to friend gives unadvised wounds
and one man's lust these many lives confounds
had doting priam cheque'd his son's desire
troy had been bright with fame and not with fire'
here feelingly she weeps troy's painted woes
for sorrow like a heavyhanging bell
once set on ringing with his own weight goes
then little strength rings out the doleful knell
so lucrece set awork sad tales doth tell
to pencill'd pensiveness and colour'd sorrow
she lends them words and she their looks doth borrow
she throws her eyes about the painting round
and whom she finds forlorn she doth lament
at last she sees a wretched image bound
that piteous looks to phrygian shepherds lent
his face though full of cares yet show'd content
onward to troy with the blunt swains he goes
so mild that patience seem'd to scorn his woes
in him the painter labour'd with his skill
to hide deceit and give the harmless show
an humble gait calm looks eyes wailing still
a brow unbent that seem'd to welcome woe
cheeks neither red nor pale but mingled so
that blushing red no guilty instance gave
nor ashy pale the fear that false hearts have
but like a constant and confirmed devil
he entertain'd a show so seeming just
and therein so ensconced his secret evil
that jealousy itself could not mistrust
falsecreeping craft and perjury should thrust
into so bright a day such blackfaced storms
or blot with hellborn sin such saintlike forms
the wellskill'd workman this mild image drew
for perjured sinon whose enchanting story
the credulous old priam after slew
whose words like wildfire burnt the shining glory
of richbuilt ilion that the skies were sorry
and little stars shot from their fixed places
when their glass fell wherein they view'd their faces
this picture she advisedly perused
and chid the painter for his wondrous skill
saying some shape in sinon's was abused
so fair a form lodged not a mind so ill
and still on him she gazed and gazing still
such signs of truth in his plain face she spied
that she concludes the picture was belied
'it cannot be quoth she'that so much guile'
she would have said can lurk in such a look'
but tarquin's shape came in her mind the while
and from her tongue can lurk from cannot took
'it cannot be she in that sense forsook
and turn'd it thus it cannot be i find
but such a face should bear a wicked mind
'for even as subtle sinon here is painted
so sobersad so weary and so mild
as if with grief or travail he had fainted
to me came tarquin armed so beguiled
with outward honesty but yet defiled
with inward vice as priam him did cherish
so did i tarquin so my troy did perish
'look look how listening priam wets his eyes
to see those borrow'd tears that sinon sheds
priam why art thou old and yet not wise
for every tear he falls a trojan bleeds
his eye drops fire no water thence proceeds
those round clear pearls of his that move thy pity
are balls of quenchless fire to burn thy city
'such devils steal effects from lightless hell
for sinon in his fire doth quake with cold
and in that cold hotburning fire doth dwell
these contraries such unity do hold
only to flatter fools and make them bold
so priam's trust false sinon's tears doth flatter
that he finds means to burn his troy with water'
here all enraged such passion her assails
that patience is quite beaten from her breast
she tears the senseless sinon with her nails
comparing him to that unhappy guest
whose deed hath made herself herself detest
at last she smilingly with this gives o'er
'fool fool quoth she his wounds will not be sore'
thus ebbs and flows the current of her sorrow
and time doth weary time with her complaining
she looks for night and then she longs for morrow
and both she thinks too long with her remaining
short time seems long in sorrow's sharp sustaining
though woe be heavy yet it seldom sleeps
