 access to you
oliver call him in
 exit dennis
 twill be a good way and tomorrow the wrestling is
 enter charles
charles good morrow to your worship
oliver good monsieur charles what's the new news at the
 new court
charles there's no news at the court sir but the old news
 that is the old duke is banished by his younger
 brother the new duke and three or four loving lords
 have put themselves into voluntary exile with him
 whose lands and revenues enrich the new duke
 therefore he gives them good leave to wander
oliver can you tell if rosalind the duke's daughter be
 banished with her father
charles o no for the duke's daughter her cousin so loves
 her being ever from their cradles bred together
 that she would have followed her exile or have died
 to stay behind her she is at the court and no
 less beloved of her uncle than his own daughter and
 never two ladies loved as they do
oliver where will the old duke live
charles they say he is already in the forest of arden and
 a many merry men with him and there they live like
 the old robin hood of england they say many young
 gentlemen flock to him every day and fleet the time
 carelessly as they did in the golden world
oliver what you wrestle tomorrow before the new duke
charles marry do i sir and i came to acquaint you with a
 matter i am given sir secretly to understand
 that your younger brother orlando hath a disposition
 to come in disguised against me to try a fall
 tomorrow sir i wrestle for my credit and he that
 escapes me without some broken limb shall acquit him
 well your brother is but young and tender and
 for your love i would be loath to foil him as i
 must for my own honour if he come in therefore
 out of my love to you i came hither to acquaint you
 withal that either you might stay him from his
 intendment or brook such disgrace well as he shall
 run into in that it is a thing of his own search
 and altogether against my will
oliver charles i thank thee for thy love to me which
 thou shalt find i will most kindly requite i had
 myself notice of my brother's purpose herein and
 have by underhand means laboured to dissuade him from
 it but he is resolute i'll tell thee charles
 it is the stubbornest young fellow of france full
 of ambition an envious emulator of every man's
 good parts a secret and villanous contriver against
 me his natural brother therefore use thy
 discretion i had as lief thou didst break his neck
 as his finger and thou wert best look to't for if
 thou dost him any slight disgrace or if he do not
 mightily grace himself on thee he will practise
 against thee by poison entrap thee by some
 treacherous device and never leave thee till he
 hath ta'en thy life by some indirect means or other
 for i assure thee and almost with tears i speak
 it there is not one so young and so villanous this
 day living i speak but brotherly of him but
 should i anatomize him to thee as he is i must
 blush and weep and thou must look pale and wonder
charles i am heartily glad i came hither to you if he come
 tomorrow i'll give him his payment if ever he go
 alone again i'll never wrestle for prize more and
 so god keep your worship
oliver farewell good charles
 exit charles
 now will i stir this gamester i hope i shall see
 an end of him for my soul yet i know not why
 hates nothing more than he yet he's gentle never
 schooled and yet learned full of noble device of
 all sorts enchantingly beloved and indeed so much
 in the heart of the world and especially of my own
 people who best know him that i am altogether
 misprised but it shall not be so long this
 wrestler shall clear all nothing remains but that
 i kindle the boy thither which now i'll go about
 exit
 as you like it
act i
scene ii lawn before the duke's palace
 enter celia and rosalind
celia i pray thee rosalind sweet my coz be merry
rosalind dear celia i show more mirth than i am mistress of
 and would you yet i were merrier unless you could
 teach me to forget a banished father you must not
 learn me how to remember any extraordinary pleasure
celia herein i see thou lovest me not with the full weight
 that i love thee if my uncle thy banished father
 had banished thy uncle the duke my father so thou
 hadst been still with me i could have taught my
 love to take thy father for mine so wouldst thou
 if the truth of thy love to me were so righteously
 tempered as mine is to thee
rosalind well i will forget the condition of my estate to
 rejoice in yours
celia you know my father hath no child but i nor none is
 like to have and truly when he dies thou shalt
 be his heir for what he hath taken away from thy
 father perforce i will render thee again in
 affection by mine honour i will and when i break
 that oath let me turn monster therefore my
 sweet rose my dear rose be merry
rosalind from henceforth i will coz and devise sports let
 me see what think you of falling in love
celia marry i prithee do to make sport withal but
 love no man in good earnest nor no further in sport
 neither than with safety of a pure blush thou mayst
 in honour come off again
rosalind what shall be our sport then
celia let us sit and mock the good housewife fortune from
 her wheel that her gifts may henceforth be bestowed equally
rosalind i would we could do so for her benefits are
 mightily misplaced and the bountiful blind woman
 doth most mistake in her gifts to women
celia tis true for those that she makes fair she scarce
 makes honest and those that she makes honest she
 makes very illfavouredly
rosalind nay now thou goest from fortune's office to
 nature's fortune reigns in gifts of the world
 not in the lineaments of nature
 enter touchstone
celia no when nature hath made a fair creature may she
 not by fortune fall into the fire though nature
 hath given us wit to flout at fortune hath not
 fortune sent in this fool to cut off the argument
rosalind indeed there is fortune too hard for nature when
 fortune makes nature's natural the cutteroff of
 nature's wit
celia peradventure this is not fortune's work neither but
 nature's who perceiveth our natural wits too dull
 to reason of such goddesses and hath sent this
 natural for our whetstone for always the dulness of
 the fool is the whetstone of the wits how now
 wit whither wander you
touchstone mistress you must come away to your father
celia were you made the messenger
touchstone no by mine honour but i was bid to come for you
rosalind where learned you that oath fool
touchstone of a certain knight that swore by his honour they
 were good pancakes and swore by his honour the
 mustard was naught now i'll stand to it the
 pancakes were naught and the mustard was good and
 yet was not the knight forsworn
celia how prove you that in the great heap of your
 knowledge
rosalind ay marry now unmuzzle your wisdom
touchstone stand you both forth now stroke your chins and
 swear by your beards that i am a knave
celia by our beards if we had them thou art
touchstone by my knavery if i had it then i were but if you
 swear by that that is not you are not forsworn no
 more was this knight swearing by his honour for he
 never had any or if he had he had sworn it away
 before ever he saw those pancakes or that mustard
celia prithee who is't that thou meanest
touchstone one that old frederick your father loves
celia my father's love is enough to honour him enough
 speak no more of him you'll be whipped for taxation
 one of these days
