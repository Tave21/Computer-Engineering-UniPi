beatrice very easily possible he wears his faith but as
 the fashion of his hat it ever changes with the
 next block
messenger i see lady the gentleman is not in your books
beatrice no an he were i would burn my study but i pray
 you who is his companion is there no young
 squarer now that will make a voyage with him to the devil
messenger he is most in the company of the right noble claudio
beatrice o lord he will hang upon him like a disease he
 is sooner caught than the pestilence and the taker
 runs presently mad god help the noble claudio if
 he have caught the benedick it will cost him a
 thousand pound ere a be cured
messenger i will hold friends with you lady
beatrice do good friend
leonato you will never run mad niece
beatrice no not till a hot january
messenger don pedro is approached
 enter don pedro don john claudio benedick
 and balthasar
don pedro good signior leonato you are come to meet your
 trouble the fashion of the world is to avoid
 cost and you encounter it
leonato never came trouble to my house in the likeness of
 your grace for trouble being gone comfort should
 remain but when you depart from me sorrow abides
 and happiness takes his leave
don pedro you embrace your charge too willingly i think this
 is your daughter
leonato her mother hath many times told me so
benedick were you in doubt sir that you asked her
leonato signior benedick no for then were you a child
don pedro you have it full benedick we may guess by this
 what you are being a man truly the lady fathers
 herself be happy lady for you are like an
 honourable father
benedick if signior leonato be her father she would not
 have his head on her shoulders for all messina as
 like him as she is
beatrice i wonder that you will still be talking signior
 benedick nobody marks you
benedick what my dear lady disdain are you yet living
beatrice is it possible disdain should die while she hath
 such meet food to feed it as signior benedick
 courtesy itself must convert to disdain if you come
 in her presence
benedick then is courtesy a turncoat but it is certain i
 am loved of all ladies only you excepted and i
 would i could find in my heart that i had not a hard
 heart for truly i love none
beatrice a dear happiness to women they would else have
 been troubled with a pernicious suitor i thank god
 and my cold blood i am of your humour for that i
 had rather hear my dog bark at a crow than a man
 swear he loves me
benedick god keep your ladyship still in that mind so some
 gentleman or other shall scape a predestinate
 scratched face
beatrice scratching could not make it worse an twere such
 a face as yours were
benedick well you are a rare parrotteacher
beatrice a bird of my tongue is better than a beast of yours
benedick i would my horse had the speed of your tongue and
 so good a continuer but keep your way i god's
 name i have done
beatrice you always end with a jade's trick i know you of old
don pedro that is the sum of all leonato signior claudio
 and signior benedick my dear friend leonato hath
 invited you all i tell him we shall stay here at
 the least a month and he heartily prays some
 occasion may detain us longer i dare swear he is no
 hypocrite but prays from his heart
leonato if you swear my lord you shall not be forsworn
 to don john
 let me bid you welcome my lord being reconciled to
 the prince your brother i owe you all duty
don john i thank you i am not of many words but i thank
 you
leonato please it your grace lead on
don pedro your hand leonato we will go together
 exeunt all except benedick and claudio
claudio benedick didst thou note the daughter of signior leonato
benedick i noted her not but i looked on her
claudio is she not a modest young lady
benedick do you question me as an honest man should do for
 my simple true judgment or would you have me speak
 after my custom as being a professed tyrant to their sex
claudio no i pray thee speak in sober judgment
benedick why i faith methinks she's too low for a high
 praise too brown for a fair praise and too little
 for a great praise only this commendation i can
 afford her that were she other than she is she
 were unhandsome and being no other but as she is i
 do not like her
claudio thou thinkest i am in sport i pray thee tell me
 truly how thou likest her
benedick would you buy her that you inquire after her
claudio can the world buy such a jewel
benedick yea and a case to put it into but speak you this
 with a sad brow or do you play the flouting jack
 to tell us cupid is a good harefinder and vulcan a
 rare carpenter come in what key shall a man take
 you to go in the song
claudio in mine eye she is the sweetest lady that ever i
 looked on
benedick i can see yet without spectacles and i see no such
 matter there's her cousin an she were not
 possessed with a fury exceeds her as much in beauty
 as the first of may doth the last of december but i
 hope you have no intent to turn husband have you
claudio i would scarce trust myself though i had sworn the
 contrary if hero would be my wife
benedick is't come to this in faith hath not the world
 one man but he will wear his cap with suspicion
 shall i never see a bachelor of threescore again
 go to i faith an thou wilt needs thrust thy neck
 into a yoke wear the print of it and sigh away
 sundays look don pedro is returned to seek you
 reenter don pedro
don pedro what secret hath held you here that you followed
 not to leonato's
benedick i would your grace would constrain me to tell
don pedro i charge thee on thy allegiance
benedick you hear count claudio i can be secret as a dumb
 man i would have you think so but on my
 allegiance mark you this on my allegiance he is
 in love with who now that is your grace's part
 mark how short his answer iswith hero leonato's
 short daughter
claudio if this were so so were it uttered
benedick like the old tale my lord it is not so nor
 twas not so but indeed god forbid it should be
 so'
claudio if my passion change not shortly god forbid it
 should be otherwise
don pedro amen if you love her for the lady is very well worthy
claudio you speak this to fetch me in my lord
don pedro by my troth i speak my thought
claudio and in faith my lord i spoke mine
benedick and by my two faiths and troths my lord i spoke mine
claudio that i love her i feel
don pedro that she is worthy i know
benedick that i neither feel how she should be loved nor
 know how she should be worthy is the opinion that
 fire cannot melt out of me i will die in it at the stake
don pedro thou wast ever an obstinate heretic in the despite
 of beauty
claudio and never could maintain his part but in the force
 of his will
benedick that a woman conceived me i thank her that she
 brought me up i likewise give her most humble
 thanks but that i will have a recheat winded in my
 forehead or hang my bugle in an invisible baldrick
 all women shall pardon me because i will not do
 them the wrong to mistrust any i will do myself the
 right to trust none and the fine is for the which
 i may go the finer i will live a bachelor
don pedro i shall see thee ere i die look pale with love
benedick with anger with sickness or with hunger my lord
 not with love prove that ever i lose more blood
 with love than i will get again with drinking pick
 out mine eyes with a balladmaker's pen and hang me
 up at the door of a brothelhouse for the sign of
 blind cupid
don pedro well if ever thou dost fall from this faith thou
 wilt prove a notable argument
benedick if i do hang me in a bottle like a cat and shoot
 at me and he that hits me let him be clapped on
 the shoulder and called adam
don pedro well as time shall try in time the savage bull
 doth bear the yoke'
benedick the savage bull may but if ever the sensible
 benedick bear it pluck off the bull's horns and set
 them in my forehead and let me be vilely painted
 and in such great letters as they write here is
 good horse to hire let them signify under my sign
 here you may see benedick the married man'
claudio if this should ever happen thou wouldst be hornmad
don pedro nay if cupid have not spent all his quiver in
 venice thou wilt quake for this shortly
benedick i look for an earthquake too then
don pedro well you temporize with the hours in the
 meantime good signior benedick repair to
 leonato's commend me to him and tell him i will
 not fail him at supper for indeed he hath made
 great preparation
benedick i have almost matter enough in me for such an
 embassage and so i commit you
claudio to the tuition of god from my house if i had it
don pedro the sixth of july your loving friend benedick
benedick nay mock not mock not the body of your
 discourse is sometime guarded with fragments and
 the guards are but slightly basted on neither ere
 you flout old ends any further examine your
 conscience and so i leave you
 exit
claudio my liege your highness now may do me good
don pedro my love is thine to teach teach it but how
 and thou shalt see how apt it is to learn
 any hard lesson that may do thee good
