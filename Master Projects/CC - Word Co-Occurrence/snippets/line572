 dear knight
sir andrew i have no exquisite reason for't but i have reason
 good enough
maria the devil a puritan that he is or any thing
 constantly but a timepleaser an affectioned ass
 that cons state without book and utters it by great
 swarths the best persuaded of himself so
 crammed as he thinks with excellencies that it is
 his grounds of faith that all that look on him love
 him and on that vice in him will my revenge find
 notable cause to work
sir toby belch what wilt thou do
maria i will drop in his way some obscure epistles of
 love wherein by the colour of his beard the shape
 of his leg the manner of his gait the expressure
 of his eye forehead and complexion he shall find
 himself most feelingly personated i can write very
 like my lady your niece on a forgotten matter we
 can hardly make distinction of our hands
sir toby belch excellent i smell a device
sir andrew i have't in my nose too
sir toby belch he shall think by the letters that thou wilt drop
 that they come from my niece and that she's in
 love with him
maria my purpose is indeed a horse of that colour
sir andrew and your horse now would make him an ass
maria ass i doubt not
sir andrew o twill be admirable
maria sport royal i warrant you i know my physic will
 work with him i will plant you two and let the
 fool make a third where he shall find the letter
 observe his construction of it for this night to
 bed and dream on the event farewell

 twelfth night
act ii
scene iv duke orsino's palace
 enter duke orsino viola curio and others
duke orsino give me some music now good morrow friends
 now good cesario but that piece of song
 that old and antique song we heard last night
 methought it did relieve my passion much
 more than light airs and recollected terms
 of these most brisk and giddypaced times
 come but one verse
curio he is not here so please your lordship that should sing it
duke orsino who was it
curio feste the jester my lord a fool that the lady
 olivia's father took much delight in he is about the house
duke orsino seek him out and play the tune the while
 exit curio music plays
 come hither boy if ever thou shalt love
 in the sweet pangs of it remember me
 for such as i am all true lovers are
 unstaid and skittish in all motions else
 save in the constant image of the creature
 that is beloved how dost thou like this tune
viola it gives a very echo to the seat
 where love is throned
duke orsino thou dost speak masterly
 my life upon't young though thou art thine eye
 hath stay'd upon some favour that it loves
 hath it not boy
viola a little by your favour
