 knowing that thou wouldst have me drown'd on shore
 with tears as salt as sea through thy unkindness
 the splitting rocks cower'd in the sinking sands
 and would not dash me with their ragged sides
 because thy flinty heart more hard than they
 might in thy palace perish margaret
 as far as i could ken thy chalky cliffs
 when from thy shore the tempest beat us back
 i stood upon the hatches in the storm
 and when the dusky sky began to rob
 my earnestgaping sight of thy land's view
 i took a costly jewel from my neck
 a heart it was bound in with diamonds
 and threw it towards thy land the sea received it
 and so i wish'd thy body might my heart
 and even with this i lost fair england's view
 and bid mine eyes be packing with my heart
 and call'd them blind and dusky spectacles
 for losing ken of albion's wished coast
 how often have i tempted suffolk's tongue
 the agent of thy foul inconstancy
 to sit and witch me as ascanius did
 when he to madding dido would unfold
 his father's acts commenced in burning troy
 am i not witch'd like her or thou not false like him
 ay me i can no more die margaret
 for henry weeps that thou dost live so long
 noise within enter warwick salisbury and many commons
warwick it is reported mighty sovereign
 that good duke humphrey traitorously is murder'd
 by suffolk and the cardinal beaufort's means
 the commons like an angry hive of bees
 that want their leader scatter up and down
 and care not who they sting in his revenge
 myself have calm'd their spleenful mutiny
 until they hear the order of his death
king henry vi that he is dead good warwick tis too true
 but how he died god knows not henry
 enter his chamber view his breathless corpse
 and comment then upon his sudden death
warwick that shall i do my liege stay salisbury
 with the rude multitude till i return
 exit
king henry vi o thou that judgest all things stay my thoughts
 my thoughts that labour to persuade my soul
 some violent hands were laid on humphrey's life
 if my suspect be false forgive me god
 for judgment only doth belong to thee
 fain would i go to chafe his paly lips
 with twenty thousand kisses and to drain
 upon his face an ocean of salt tears
 to tell my love unto his dumb deaf trunk
 and with my fingers feel his hand unfeeling
 but all in vain are these mean obsequies
 and to survey his dead and earthly image
 what were it but to make my sorrow greater
 reenter warwick and others bearing
 gloucester's body on a bed
warwick come hither gracious sovereign view this body
king henry vi that is to see how deep my grave is made
 for with his soul fled all my worldly solace
 for seeing him i see my life in death
warwick as surely as my soul intends to live
 with that dread king that took our state upon him
 to free us from his father's wrathful curse
 i do believe that violent hands were laid
 upon the life of this thricefamed duke
suffolk a dreadful oath sworn with a solemn tongue
 what instance gives lord warwick for his vow
warwick see how the blood is settled in his face
 oft have i seen a timelyparted ghost
 of ashy semblance meagre pale and bloodless
 being all descended to the labouring heart
 who in the conflict that it holds with death
 attracts the same for aidance gainst the enemy
 which with the heart there cools and ne'er returneth
 to blush and beautify the cheek again
 but see his face is black and full of blood
 his eyeballs further out than when he lived
 staring full ghastly like a strangled man
 his hair uprear'd his nostrils stretched with struggling
 his hands abroad display'd as one that grasp'd
 and tugg'd for life and was by strength subdued
 look on the sheets his hair you see is sticking
 his wellproportion'd beard made rough and rugged
 like to the summer's corn by tempest lodged
 it cannot be but he was murder'd here
 the least of all these signs were probable
suffolk why warwick who should do the duke to death
 myself and beaufort had him in protection
 and we i hope sir are no murderers
warwick but both of you were vow'd duke humphrey's foes
 and you forsooth had the good duke to keep
 tis like you would not feast him like a friend
 and tis well seen he found an enemy
queen margaret then you belike suspect these noblemen
 as guilty of duke humphrey's timeless death
warwick who finds the heifer dead and bleeding fresh
 and sees fast by a butcher with an axe
 but will suspect twas he that made the slaughter
 who finds the partridge in the puttock's nest
 but may imagine how the bird was dead
 although the kite soar with unbloodied beak
 even so suspicious is this tragedy
queen margaret are you the butcher suffolk where's your knife
 is beaufort term'd a kite where are his talons
suffolk i wear no knife to slaughter sleeping men
 but here's a vengeful sword rusted with ease
 that shall be scoured in his rancorous heart
 that slanders me with murder's crimson badge
 say if thou darest proud lord of warwickshire
 that i am faulty in duke humphrey's death
 exeunt cardinal somerset and others
warwick what dares not warwick if false suffolk dare him
queen margaret he dares not calm his contumelious spirit
 nor cease to be an arrogant controller
 though suffolk dare him twenty thousand times
warwick madam be still with reverence may i say
 for every word you speak in his behalf
 is slander to your royal dignity
suffolk bluntwitted lord ignoble in demeanor
 if ever lady wrong'd her lord so much
 thy mother took into her blameful bed
 some stern untutor'd churl and noble stock
 was graft with crabtree slip whose fruit thou art
 and never of the nevils noble race
warwick but that the guilt of murder bucklers thee
 and i should rob the deathsman of his fee
 quitting thee thereby of ten thousand shames
 and that my sovereign's presence makes me mild
 i would false murderous coward on thy knee
 make thee beg pardon for thy passed speech
 and say it was thy mother that thou meant'st
 that thou thyself was born in bastardy
 and after all this fearful homage done
 give thee thy hire and send thy soul to hell
 pernicious bloodsucker of sleeping men
suffolk thou shall be waking well i shed thy blood
 if from this presence thou darest go with me
warwick away even now or i will drag thee hence
 unworthy though thou art i'll cope with thee
 and do some service to duke humphrey's ghost
 exeunt suffolk and warwick
king henry vi what stronger breastplate than a heart untainted
 thrice is he armed that hath his quarrel just
 and he but naked though lock'd up in steel
 whose conscience with injustice is corrupted
 a noise within
queen margaret what noise is this
 reenter suffolk and warwick with their
 weapons drawn
king henry vi why how now lords your wrathful weapons drawn
 here in our presence dare you be so bold
 why what tumultuous clamour have we here
suffolk the traitorous warwick with the men of bury
 set all upon me mighty sovereign
salisbury to the commons entering sirs stand apart
 the king shall know your mind
 dread lord the commons send you word by me
 unless lord suffolk straight be done to death
 or banished fair england's territories
 they will by violence tear him from your palace
 and torture him with grievous lingering death
 they say by him the good duke humphrey died
 they say in him they fear your highness death
 and mere instinct of love and loyalty
 free from a stubborn opposite intent
 as being thought to contradict your liking
 makes them thus forward in his banishment
 they say in care of your most royal person
 that if your highness should intend to sleep
 and charge that no man should disturb your rest
 in pain of your dislike or pain of death
 yet notwithstanding such a strait edict
 were there a serpent seen with forked tongue
 that slily glided towards your majesty
 it were but necessary you were waked
 lest being suffer'd in that harmful slumber
 the mortal worm might make the sleep eternal
 and therefore do they cry though you forbid
 that they will guard you whether you will or no
 from such fell serpents as false suffolk is
 with whose envenomed and fatal sting
 your loving uncle twenty times his worth
 they say is shamefully bereft of life
commons within an answer from the king my
 lord of salisbury
suffolk tis like the commons rude unpolish'd hinds
 could send such message to their sovereign
 but you my lord were glad to be employ'd
 to show how quaint an orator you are
 but all the honour salisbury hath won
 is that he was the lord ambassador
 sent from a sort of tinkers to the king
commons within an answer from the king or we will all break in
king henry vi go salisbury and tell them all from me
 i thank them for their tender loving care
 and had i not been cited so by them
 yet did i purpose as they do entreat
 for sure my thoughts do hourly prophesy
