act iv
scene iii juliet's chamber
 enter juliet and nurse
juliet ay those attires are best but gentle nurse
 i pray thee leave me to myself tonight
 for i have need of many orisons
 to move the heavens to smile upon my state
 which well thou know'st is cross and full of sin
 enter lady capulet
lady capulet what are you busy ho need you my help
juliet no madam we have cull'd such necessaries
 as are behoveful for our state tomorrow
 so please you let me now be left alone
 and let the nurse this night sit up with you
 for i am sure you have your hands full all
 in this so sudden business
lady capulet good night
 get thee to bed and rest for thou hast need
 exeunt lady capulet and nurse
juliet farewell god knows when we shall meet again
 i have a faint cold fear thrills through my veins
 that almost freezes up the heat of life
 i'll call them back again to comfort me
 nurse what should she do here
 my dismal scene i needs must act alone
 come vial
 what if this mixture do not work at all
 shall i be married then tomorrow morning
 no no this shall forbid it lie thou there
 laying down her dagger
 what if it be a poison which the friar
 subtly hath minister'd to have me dead
 lest in this marriage he should be dishonour'd
 because he married me before to romeo
 i fear it is and yet methinks it should not
 for he hath still been tried a holy man
 how if when i am laid into the tomb
 i wake before the time that romeo
 come to redeem me there's a fearful point
 shall i not then be stifled in the vault
 to whose foul mouth no healthsome air breathes in
 and there die strangled ere my romeo comes
 or if i live is it not very like
 the horrible conceit of death and night
 together with the terror of the place
 as in a vault an ancient receptacle
 where for these many hundred years the bones
 of all my buried ancestors are packed
 where bloody tybalt yet but green in earth
 lies festering in his shroud where as they say
 at some hours in the night spirits resort
 alack alack is it not like that i
 so early waking what with loathsome smells
 and shrieks like mandrakes torn out of the earth
 that living mortals hearing them run mad
 o if i wake shall i not be distraught
 environed with all these hideous fears
 and madly play with my forefather's joints
 and pluck the mangled tybalt from his shroud
 and in this rage with some great kinsman's bone
 as with a club dash out my desperate brains
 o look methinks i see my cousin's ghost
 seeking out romeo that did spit his body
 upon a rapier's point stay tybalt stay
 romeo i come this do i drink to thee
 she falls upon her bed within the curtains
