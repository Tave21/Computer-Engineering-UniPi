as yet i am as strong this day as i was in the day that moses sent me as my strength was then even so is my strength now for war both to go out and to come in
now therefore give me this mountain whereof the lord spake in that day for thou heardest in that day how the anakims were there and that the cities were great and fenced if so be the lord will be with me then i shall be able to drive them out as the lord said

and he went up thence to the inhabitants of debir and the name of debir before was kirjathsepher
and caleb said he that smiteth kirjathsepher and taketh it to him will i give achsah my daughter to wife
and othniel the son of kenaz the brother of caleb took it and he gave him achsah his daughter to wife

and the lot of the children of joseph fell from jordan by jericho unto the water of jericho on the east to the wilderness that goeth up from jericho throughout mount bethel
and goeth out from bethel to luz and passeth along unto the borders of archi to ataroth
and goeth down westward to the coast of japhleti unto the coast of bethhoron the nether and to gezer and the goings out thereof are at the sea
so the children of joseph manasseh and ephraim took their inheritance
and the border of the children of ephraim according to their families was thus even the border of their inheritance on the east side was atarothaddar unto bethhoron the upper
and the border went out toward the sea to michmethah on the north side and the border went about eastward unto taanathshiloh and passed by it on the east to janohah
and it went down from janohah to ataroth and to naarath and came to jericho and went out at jordan
the border went out from tappuah westward unto the river kanah and the goings out thereof were at the sea this is the inheritance of the tribe of the children of ephraim by their families
and the separate cities for the children of ephraim were among the inheritance of the children of manasseh all the cities with their villages
and they drave not out the canaanites that dwelt in gezer but the canaanites dwell among the ephraimites unto this day and serve under tribute
there was also a lot for the tribe of manasseh for he was the firstborn of joseph to wit for machir the firstborn of manasseh the father of gilead because he was a man of war therefore he had gilead and bashan
there was also a lot for the rest of the children of manasseh by their families for the children of abiezer and for the children of helek and for the children of asriel and for the children of shechem and for the children of hepher and for the children of shemida these were the male children of manasseh the son of joseph by their families
but zelophehad the son of hepher the son of gilead the son of machir the son of manasseh had no sons but daughters and these are the names of his daughters mahlah and noah hoglah milcah and tirzah
and they came near before eleazar the priest and before joshua the son of nun and before the princes saying the lord commanded moses to give us an inheritance among our brethren therefore according to the commandment of the lord he gave them an inheritance among the brethren of their father
and there fell ten portions to manasseh beside the land of gilead and bashan which were on the other side jordan
because the daughters of manasseh had an inheritance among his sons and the rest of manasseh's sons had the land of gilead
and the coast of manasseh was from asher to michmethah that lieth before shechem and the border went along on the right hand unto the inhabitants of entappuah
now manasseh had the land of tappuah but tappuah on the border of manasseh belonged to the children of ephraim
and the coast descended unto the river kanah southward of the river these cities of ephraim are among the cities of manasseh the coast of manasseh also was on the north side of the river and the outgoings of it were at the sea
southward it was ephraim's and northward it was manasseh's and the sea is his border and they met together in asher on the north and in issachar on the east
and manasseh had in issachar and in asher bethshean and her towns and ibleam and her towns and the inhabitants of dor and her towns and the inhabitants of endor and her towns and the inhabitants of taanach and her towns and the inhabitants of megiddo and her towns even three countries
yet the children of manasseh could not drive out the inhabitants of those cities but the canaanites would dwell in that land
yet it came to pass when the children of israel were waxen strong that they put the canaanites to tribute but did not utterly drive them out
and the children of joseph spake unto joshua saying why hast thou given me but one lot and one portion to inherit seeing i am a great people forasmuch as the lord hath blessed me hitherto
and joshua answered them if thou be a great people then get thee up to the wood country and cut down for thyself there in the land of the perizzites and of the giants if mount ephraim be too narrow for thee
and the children of joseph said the hill is not enough for us and all the canaanites that dwell in the land of the valley have chariots of iron both they who are of bethshean and her towns and they who are of the valley of jezreel
and joshua spake unto the house of joseph even to ephraim and to manasseh saying thou art a great people and hast great power thou shalt not have one lot only
but the mountain shall be thine for it is a wood and thou shalt cut it down and the outgoings of it shall be thine for thou shalt drive out the canaanites though they have iron chariots and though they be strong
and the whole congregation of the children of israel assembled together at shiloh and set up the tabernacle of the congregation there and the land was subdued before them
and there remained among the children of israel seven tribes which had not yet received their inheritance
and joshua said unto the children of israel how long are ye slack to go to possess the land which the lord god of your fathers hath given you
give out from among you three men for each tribe and i will send them and they shall rise and go through the land and describe it according to the inheritance of them and they shall come again to me
and they shall divide it into seven parts judah shall abide in their coast on the south and the house of joseph shall abide in their coasts on the north
ye shall therefore describe the land into seven parts and bring the description hither to me that i may cast lots for you here before the lord our god
but the levites have no part among you for the priesthood of the lord is their inheritance and gad and reuben and half the tribe of manasseh have received their inheritance beyond jordan on the east which moses the servant of the lord gave them
and the men arose and went away and joshua charged them that went to describe the land saying go and walk through the land and describe it and come again to me that i may here cast lots for you before the lord in shiloh
and the men went and passed through the land and described it by cities into seven parts in a book and came again to joshua to the host at shiloh
and joshua cast lots for them in shiloh before the lord and there joshua divided the land unto the children of israel according to their divisions

speak to the children of israel saying appoint out for you cities of refuge whereof i spake unto you by the hand of moses
that the slayer that killeth any person unawares and unwittingly may flee thither and they shall be your refuge from the avenger of blood
and when he that doth flee unto one of those cities shall stand at the entering of the gate of the city and shall declare his cause in the ears of the elders of that city they shall take him into the city unto them and give him a place that he may dwell among them
and if the avenger of blood pursue after him then they shall not deliver the slayer up into his hand because he smote his neighbour unwittingly and hated him not beforetime
