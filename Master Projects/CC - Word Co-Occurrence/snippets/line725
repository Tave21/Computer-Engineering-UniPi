 i feel my heart new open'd o how wretched
 is that poor man that hangs on princes favours
 there is betwixt that smile we would aspire to
 that sweet aspect of princes and their ruin
 more pangs and fears than wars or women have
 and when he falls he falls like lucifer
 never to hope again
 enter cromwell and stands amazed
 why how now cromwell
cromwell i have no power to speak sir
cardinal wolsey what amazed
 at my misfortunes can thy spirit wonder
 a great man should decline nay an you weep
 i am fall'n indeed
cromwell how does your grace
cardinal wolsey why well
 never so truly happy my good cromwell
 i know myself now and i feel within me
 a peace above all earthly dignities
 a still and quiet conscience the king has cured me
 i humbly thank his grace and from these shoulders
 these ruin'd pillars out of pity taken
 a load would sink a navy too much honour
 o tis a burthen cromwell tis a burthen
 too heavy for a man that hopes for heaven
cromwell i am glad your grace has made that right use of it
cardinal wolsey i hope i have i am able now methinks
 out of a fortitude of soul i feel
 to endure more miseries and greater far
 than my weakhearted enemies dare offer
 what news abroad
cromwell the heaviest and the worst
 is your displeasure with the king
cardinal wolsey god bless him
cromwell the next is that sir thomas more is chosen
 lord chancellor in your place
cardinal wolsey that's somewhat sudden
 but he's a learned man may he continue
 long in his highness favour and do justice
 for truth's sake and his conscience that his bones
 when he has run his course and sleeps in blessings
 may have a tomb of orphans tears wept on em what more
cromwell that cranmer is return'd with welcome
 install'd lord archbishop of canterbury
cardinal wolsey that's news indeed
cromwell last that the lady anne
 whom the king hath in secrecy long married
 this day was view'd in open as his queen
 going to chapel and the voice is now
 only about her coronation
cardinal wolsey there was the weight that pull'd me down o cromwell
 the king has gone beyond me all my glories
 in that one woman i have lost for ever
 no sun shall ever usher forth mine honours
 or gild again the noble troops that waited
 upon my smiles go get thee from me cromwell
 i am a poor fall'n man unworthy now
 to be thy lord and master seek the king
 that sun i pray may never set i have told him
 what and how true thou art he will advance thee
 some little memory of me will stir him
 i know his noble naturenot to let
 thy hopeful service perish too good cromwell
 neglect him not make use now and provide
 for thine own future safety
cromwell o my lord
 must i then leave you must i needs forego
 so good so noble and so true a master
 bear witness all that have not hearts of iron
 with what a sorrow cromwell leaves his lord
 the king shall have my service but my prayers
 for ever and for ever shall be yours
cardinal wolsey cromwell i did not think to shed a tear
 in all my miseries but thou hast forced me
 out of thy honest truth to play the woman
 let's dry our eyes and thus far hear me cromwell
 and when i am forgotten as i shall be
 and sleep in dull cold marble where no mention
 of me more must be heard of say i taught thee
 say wolsey that once trod the ways of glory
 and sounded all the depths and shoals of honour
 found thee a way out of his wreck to rise in
 a sure and safe one though thy master miss'd it
 mark but my fall and that that ruin'd me
 cromwell i charge thee fling away ambition
 by that sin fell the angels how can man then
 the image of his maker hope to win by it
 love thyself last cherish those hearts that hate thee
 corruption wins not more than honesty
 still in thy right hand carry gentle peace
 to silence envious tongues be just and fear not
 let all the ends thou aim'st at be thy country's
 thy god's and truth's then if thou fall'st
 o cromwell
 thou fall'st a blessed martyr serve the king
 andprithee lead me in
 there take an inventory of all i have
 to the last penny tis the king's my robe
 and my integrity to heaven is all
 i dare now call mine own o cromwell cromwell
 had i but served my god with half the zeal
 i served my king he would not in mine age
 have left me naked to mine enemies
cromwell good sir have patience
cardinal wolsey so i have farewell
 the hopes of court my hopes in heaven do dwell
 exeunt
