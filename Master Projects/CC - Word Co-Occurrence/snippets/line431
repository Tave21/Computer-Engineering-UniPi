 that shall express my true love's fasting pain
 o would the king biron and longaville
 were lovers too ill to example ill
 would from my forehead wipe a perjured note
 for none offend where all alike do dote
longaville advancing dumain thy love is far from charity
 you may look pale but i should blush i know
 to be o'erheard and taken napping so
ferdinand advancing come sir you blush as his your case is such
 you chide at him offending twice as much
 you do not love maria longaville
 did never sonnet for her sake compile
 nor never lay his wreathed arms athwart
 his loving bosom to keep down his heart
 i have been closely shrouded in this bush
 and mark'd you both and for you both did blush
 i heard your guilty rhymes observed your fashion
 saw sighs reek from you noted well your passion
 ay me says one o jove the other cries
 one her hairs were gold crystal the other's eyes
 to longaville
 you would for paradise break faith and troth
 to dumain
 and jove for your love would infringe an oath
 what will biron say when that he shall hear
 faith so infringed which such zeal did swear
 how will he scorn how will he spend his wit
 how will he triumph leap and laugh at it
 for all the wealth that ever i did see
 i would not have him know so much by me
biron now step i forth to whip hypocrisy
 advancing
 ah good my liege i pray thee pardon me
 good heart what grace hast thou thus to reprove
 these worms for loving that art most in love
 your eyes do make no coaches in your tears
 there is no certain princess that appears
 you'll not be perjured tis a hateful thing
 tush none but minstrels like of sonneting
 but are you not ashamed nay are you not
 all three of you to be thus much o'ershot
 you found his mote the king your mote did see
 but i a beam do find in each of three
 o what a scene of foolery have i seen
 of sighs of groans of sorrow and of teen
 o me with what strict patience have i sat
 to see a king transformed to a gnat
 to see great hercules whipping a gig
 and profound solomon to tune a jig
 and nestor play at pushpin with the boys
 and critic timon laugh at idle toys
 where lies thy grief o tell me good dumain
 and gentle longaville where lies thy pain
 and where my liege's all about the breast
 a caudle ho
ferdinand too bitter is thy jest
 are we betray'd thus to thy overview
biron not you to me but i betray'd by you
 i that am honest i that hold it sin
 to break the vow i am engaged in
 i am betray'd by keeping company
 with men like men of inconstancy
 when shall you see me write a thing in rhyme
 or groan for love or spend a minute's time
 in pruning me when shall you hear that i
 will praise a hand a foot a face an eye
 a gait a state a brow a breast a waist
 a leg a limb
ferdinand soft whither away so fast
 a true man or a thief that gallops so
biron i post from love good lover let me go
 enter jaquenetta and costard
jaquenetta god bless the king
ferdinand what present hast thou there
costard some certain treason
ferdinand what makes treason here
costard nay it makes nothing sir
ferdinand if it mar nothing neither
 the treason and you go in peace away together
jaquenetta i beseech your grace let this letter be read
 our parson misdoubts it twas treason he said
ferdinand biron read it over
 giving him the paper
 where hadst thou it
jaquenetta of costard
ferdinand where hadst thou it
costard of dun adramadio dun adramadio
 biron tears the letter
ferdinand how now what is in you why dost thou tear it
biron a toy my liege a toy your grace needs not fear it
longaville it did move him to passion and therefore let's hear it
dumain it is biron's writing and here is his name
 gathering up the pieces
biron to costard ah you whoreson loggerhead you were
 born to do me shame
 guilty my lord guilty i confess i confess
ferdinand what
biron that you three fools lack'd me fool to make up the mess
 he he and you and you my liege and i
 are pickpurses in love and we deserve to die
 o dismiss this audience and i shall tell you more
dumain now the number is even
biron true true we are four
 will these turtles be gone
ferdinand hence sirs away
costard walk aside the true folk and let the traitors stay
 exeunt costard and jaquenetta
biron sweet lords sweet lovers o let us embrace
 as true we are as flesh and blood can be
 the sea will ebb and flow heaven show his face
 young blood doth not obey an old decree
 we cannot cross the cause why we were born
 therefore of all hands must we be forsworn
ferdinand what did these rent lines show some love of thine
biron did they quoth you who sees the heavenly rosaline
 that like a rude and savage man of inde
 at the first opening of the gorgeous east
 bows not his vassal head and strucken blind
 kisses the base ground with obedient breast
 what peremptory eaglesighted eye
 dares look upon the heaven of her brow
 that is not blinded by her majesty
ferdinand what zeal what fury hath inspired thee now
 my love her mistress is a gracious moon
 she an attending star scarce seen a light
biron my eyes are then no eyes nor i biron
 o but for my love day would turn to night
 of all complexions the cull'd sovereignty
 do meet as at a fair in her fair cheek
 where several worthies make one dignity
 where nothing wants that want itself doth seek
 lend me the flourish of all gentle tongues
 fie painted rhetoric o she needs it not
 to things of sale a seller's praise belongs
 she passes praise then praise too short doth blot
 a wither'd hermit fivescore winters worn
 might shake off fifty looking in her eye
 beauty doth varnish age as if newborn
 and gives the crutch the cradle's infancy
 o tis the sun that maketh all things shine
ferdinand by heaven thy love is black as ebony
biron is ebony like her o wood divine
 a wife of such wood were felicity
 o who can give an oath where is a book
 that i may swear beauty doth beauty lack
 if that she learn not of her eye to look
 no face is fair that is not full so black
ferdinand o paradox black is the badge of hell
 the hue of dungeons and the suit of night
 and beauty's crest becomes the heavens well
biron devils soonest tempt resembling spirits of light
 o if in black my lady's brows be deck'd
 it mourns that painting and usurping hair
 should ravish doters with a false aspect
 and therefore is she born to make black fair
 her favour turns the fashion of the days
 for native blood is counted painting now
 and therefore red that would avoid dispraise
 paints itself black to imitate her brow
dumain to look like her are chimneysweepers black
longaville and since her time are colliers counted bright
ferdinand and ethiopes of their sweet complexion crack
dumain dark needs no candles now for dark is light
biron your mistresses dare never come in rain
 for fear their colours should be wash'd away
ferdinand twere good yours did for sir to tell you plain
 i'll find a fairer face not wash'd today
biron i'll prove her fair or talk till doomsday here
ferdinand no devil will fright thee then so much as she
dumain i never knew man hold vile stuff so dear
longaville look here's thy love my foot and her face see
biron o if the streets were paved with thine eyes
 her feet were much too dainty for such tread
dumain o vile then as she goes what upward lies
 the street should see as she walk'd overhead
ferdinand but what of this are we not all in love
biron nothing so sure and thereby all forsworn
ferdinand then leave this chat and good biron now prove
 our loving lawful and our faith not torn
dumain ay marry there some flattery for this evil
longaville o some authority how to proceed
 some tricks some quillets how to cheat the devil
dumain some salve for perjury
biron tis more than need
 have at you then affection's men at arms
 consider what you first did swear unto
 to fast to study and to see no woman
 flat treason gainst the kingly state of youth
 say can you fast your stomachs are too young
 and abstinence engenders maladies
 and where that you have vow'd to study lords
 in that each of you have forsworn his book
 can you still dream and pore and thereon look
 for when would you my lord or you or you
 have found the ground of study's excellence
 without the beauty of a woman's face
 from women's eyes this doctrine i derive
 they are the ground the books the academes
 from whence doth spring the true promethean fire
 why universal plodding poisons up
