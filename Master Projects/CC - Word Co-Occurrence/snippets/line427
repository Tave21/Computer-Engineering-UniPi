boyet a woman sometimes an you saw her in the light
longaville perchance light in the light i desire her name
boyet she hath but one for herself to desire that were a shame
longaville pray you sir whose daughter
boyet her mother's i have heard
longaville god's blessing on your beard
boyet good sir be not offended
 she is an heir of falconbridge

boyet farewell to me sir and welcome to you
 exit biron
maria that last is biron the merry madcap lord
 not a word with him but a jest
boyet and every jest but a word
princess it was well done of you to take him at his word
boyet i was as willing to grapple as he was to board
maria two hot sheeps marry
boyet and wherefore not ships
 no sheep sweet lamb unless we feed on your lips
maria you sheep and i pasture shall that finish the jest
boyet so you grant pasture for me
 offering to kiss her
maria not so gentle beast
 my lips are no common though several they be
boyet belonging to whom
maria to my fortunes and me
princess good wits will be jangling but gentles agree
 this civil war of wits were much better used
 on navarre and his bookmen for here tis abused
boyet if my observation which very seldom lies
 by the heart's still rhetoric disclosed with eyes
 deceive me not now navarre is infected
princess with what
boyet with that which we lovers entitle affected
princess your reason
boyet why all his behaviors did make their retire
 to the court of his eye peeping thorough desire
 his heart like an agate with your print impress'd
 proud with his form in his eye pride express'd
 his tongue all impatient to speak and not see
 did stumble with haste in his eyesight to be
 all senses to that sense did make their repair
 to feel only looking on fairest of fair
 methought all his senses were lock'd in his eye
 as jewels in crystal for some prince to buy
 who tendering their own worth from where they were glass'd
 did point you to buy them along as you pass'd
 his face's own margent did quote such amazes
 that all eyes saw his eyes enchanted with gazes
 i'll give you aquitaine and all that is his
 an you give him for my sake but one loving kiss
princess come to our pavilion boyet is disposed
boyet but to speak that in words which his eye hath
 disclosed
 i only have made a mouth of his eye
 by adding a tongue which i know will not lie
rosaline thou art an old lovemonger and speakest skilfully
maria he is cupid's grandfather and learns news of him
rosaline then was venus like her mother for her father is but grim
boyet do you hear my mad wenches
maria no
boyet what then do you see
rosaline ay our way to be gone
boyet you are too hard for me

 the tongue's end canary to it with your feet humour
 it with turning up your eyelids sigh a note and
 sing a note sometime through the throat as if you
 swallowed love with singing love sometime through
 the nose as if you snuffed up love by smelling
 love with your hat penthouselike o'er the shop of
 your eyes with your arms crossed on your thinbelly
 doublet like a rabbit on a spit or your hands in
 your pocket like a man after the old painting and
 keep not too long in one tune but a snip and away

 betray nice wenches that would be betrayed without
 these and make them men of notedo you note
