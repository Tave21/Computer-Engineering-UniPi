thus shall ye separate the children of israel from their uncleanness that they die not in their uncleanness when they defile my tabernacle that is among them
this is the law of him that hath an issue and of him whose seed goeth from him and is defiled therewith
and of her that is sick of her flowers and of him that hath an issue of the man and of the woman and of him that lieth with her that is unclean
and the lord spake unto moses after the death of the two sons of aaron when they offered before the lord and died
and the lord said unto moses speak unto aaron thy brother that he come not at all times into the holy place within the vail before the mercy seat which is upon the ark that he die not for i will appear in the cloud upon the mercy seat
thus shall aaron come into the holy place with a young bullock for a sin offering and a ram for a burnt offering

and he shall take of the blood of the bullock and sprinkle it with his finger upon the mercy seat eastward and before the mercy seat shall he sprinkle of the blood with his finger seven times
then shall he kill the goat of the sin offering that is for the people and bring his blood within the vail and do with that blood as he did with the blood of the bullock and sprinkle it upon the mercy seat and before the mercy seat
and he shall make an atonement for the holy place because of the uncleanness of the children of israel and because of their transgressions in all their sins and so shall he do for the tabernacle of the congregation that remaineth among them in the midst of their uncleanness
and there shall be no man in the tabernacle of the congregation when he goeth in to make an atonement in the holy place until he come out and have made an atonement for himself and for his household and for all the congregation of israel
and he shall go out unto the altar that is before the lord and make an atonement for it and shall take of the blood of the bullock and of the blood of the goat and put it upon the horns of the altar round about
and he shall sprinkle of the blood upon it with his finger seven times and cleanse it and hallow it from the uncleanness of the children of israel
and when he hath made an end of reconciling the holy place and the tabernacle of the congregation and the altar he shall bring the live goat
and aaron shall lay both his hands upon the head of the live goat and confess over him all the iniquities of the children of israel and all their transgressions in all their sins putting them upon the head of the goat and shall send him away by the hand of a fit man into the wilderness
and the goat shall bear upon him all their iniquities unto a land not inhabited and he shall let go the goat in the wilderness
and aaron shall come into the tabernacle of the congregation and shall put off the linen garments which he put on when he went into the holy place and shall leave them there

and the lord spake unto moses saying
speak unto aaron and unto his sons and unto all the children of israel and say unto them this is the thing which the lord hath commanded saying
what man soever there be of the house of israel that killeth an ox or lamb or goat in the camp or that killeth it out of the camp
and bringeth it not unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation to offer an offering unto the lord before the tabernacle of the lord blood shall be imputed unto that man he hath shed blood and that man shall be cut off from among his people
to the end that the children of israel may bring their sacrifices which they offer in the open field even that they may bring them unto the lord unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation unto the priest and offer them for peace offerings unto the lord
and the priest shall sprinkle the blood upon the altar of the lord at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation and burn the fat for a sweet savour unto the lord
and they shall no more offer their sacrifices unto devils after whom they have gone a whoring this shall be a statute for ever unto them throughout their generations
and thou shalt say unto them whatsoever man there be of the house of israel or of the strangers which sojourn among you that offereth a burnt offering or sacrifice
and bringeth it not unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation to offer it unto the lord even that man shall be cut off from among his people
and whatsoever man there be of the house of israel or of the strangers that sojourn among you that eateth any manner of blood i will even set my face against that soul that eateth blood and will cut him off from among his people
for the life of the flesh is in the blood and i have given it to you upon the altar to make an atonement for your souls for it is the blood that maketh an atonement for the soul
therefore i said unto the children of israel no soul of you shall eat blood neither shall any stranger that sojourneth among you eat blood
and whatsoever man there be of the children of israel or of the strangers that sojourn among you which hunteth and catcheth any beast or fowl that may be eaten he shall even pour out the blood thereof and cover it with dust
for it is the life of all flesh the blood of it is for the life thereof therefore i said unto the children of israel ye shall eat the blood of no manner of flesh for the life of all flesh is the blood thereof whosoever eateth it shall be cut off
and every soul that eateth that which died of itself or that which was torn with beasts whether it be one of your own country or a stranger he shall both wash his clothes and bathe himself in water and be unclean until the even then shall he be clean
but if he wash them not nor bathe his flesh then he shall bear his iniquity
