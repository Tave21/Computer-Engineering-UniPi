first sailor sir your queen must overboard the sea works high
 the wind is loud and will not lie till the ship be
 cleared of the dead
pericles that's your superstition
first sailor pardon us sir with us at sea it hath been still
 observed and we are strong in custom therefore
 briefly yield her for she must overboard straight
pericles as you think meet most wretched queen
lychorida here she lies sir
pericles a terrible childbed hast thou had my dear
 no light no fire the unfriendly elements
 forgot thee utterly nor have i time
 to give thee hallow'd to thy grave but straight
 must cast thee scarcely coffin'd in the ooze
 where for a monument upon thy bones
 and e'erremaining lamps the belching whale
 and humming water must o'erwhelm thy corpse
 lying with simple shells o lychorida
 bid nestor bring me spices ink and paper
 my casket and my jewels and bid nicander
 bring me the satin coffer lay the babe
 upon the pillow hie thee whiles i say
 a priestly farewell to her suddenly woman
 exit lychorida
second sailor sir we have a chest beneath the hatches caulked
 and bitumed ready
pericles i thank thee mariner say what coast is this
second sailor we are near tarsus
pericles thither gentle mariner
 alter thy course for tyre when canst thou reach it
second sailor by break of day if the wind cease
pericles o make for tarsus
 there will i visit cleon for the babe
 cannot hold out to tyrus there i'll leave it
 at careful nursing go thy ways good mariner
 i'll bring the body presently
 exeunt

scene ii ephesus a room in cerimon's house
 enter cerimon with a servant and some persons who
 have been shipwrecked
cerimon philemon ho
 enter philemon
philemon doth my lord call
cerimon get fire and meat for these poor men
 t has been a turbulent and stormy night
servant i have been in many but such a night as this
 till now i ne'er endured
cerimon your master will be dead ere you return
 there's nothing can be minister'd to nature
 that can recover him
 to philemon
 give this to the pothecary
 and tell me how it works
 exeunt all but cerimon
 enter two gentlemen
first gentleman good morrow
second gentleman good morrow to your lordship
cerimon gentlemen
 why do you stir so early
first gentleman sir
 our lodgings standing bleak upon the sea
 shook as the earth did quake
 the very principals did seem to rend
 and allto topple pure surprise and fear
 made me to quit the house
second gentleman that is the cause we trouble you so early
 tis not our husbandry
cerimon o you say well
first gentleman but i much marvel that your lordship having
 rich tire about you should at these early hours
 shake off the golden slumber of repose
 tis most strange
 nature should be so conversant with pain
 being thereto not compell'd
cerimon i hold it ever
 virtue and cunning were endowments greater
 than nobleness and riches careless heirs
 may the two latter darken and expend
 but immortality attends the former
 making a man a god tis known i ever
 have studied physic through which secret art
 by turning o'er authorities i have
 together with my practise made familiar
 to me and to my aid the blest infusions
 that dwell in vegetives in metals stones
 and i can speak of the disturbances
 that nature works and of her cures which doth give me
 a more content in course of true delight
 than to be thirsty after tottering honour
 or tie my treasure up in silken bags
 to please the fool and death
second gentleman your honour has through ephesus pour'd forth
 your charity and hundreds call themselves
 your creatures who by you have been restored
 and not your knowledge your personal pain but even
 your purse still open hath built lord cerimon
 such strong renown as time shall ne'er decay
 enter two or three servants with a chest
first servant so lift there
cerimon what is that
first servant sir even now
 did the sea toss upon our shore this chest
 tis of some wreck
cerimon set t down let's look upon't
second gentleman tis like a coffin sir
cerimon whate'er it be
 tis wondrous heavy wrench it open straight
 if the sea's stomach be o'ercharged with gold
 tis a good constraint of fortune it belches upon us
second gentleman tis so my lord
cerimon how close tis caulk'd and bitumed
 did the sea cast it up
first servant i never saw so huge a billow sir
 as toss'd it upon shore
cerimon wrench it open
 soft it smells most sweetly in my sense
second gentleman a delicate odour
cerimon as ever hit my nostril so up with it
 o you most potent gods what's here a corse
first gentleman most strange
cerimon shrouded in cloth of state balm'd and entreasured
 with full bags of spices a passport too
 apollo perfect me in the characters
 reads from a scroll
 here i give to understand
 if e'er this coffin drive aland
 i king pericles have lost
 this queen worth all our mundane cost
 who finds her give her burying
 she was the daughter of a king
 besides this treasure for a fee
 the gods requite his charity'
 if thou livest pericles thou hast a heart
 that even cracks for woe this chanced tonight
second gentleman most likely sir
cerimon nay certainly tonight
 for look how fresh she looks they were too rough
 that threw her in the sea make a fire within
 fetch hither all my boxes in my closet
 exit a servant
 death may usurp on nature many hours
 and yet the fire of life kindle again
 the o'erpress'd spirits i heard of an egyptian
 that had nine hours lien dead
 who was by good appliance recovered
 reenter a servant with boxes napkins and fire
 well said well said the fire and cloths
 the rough and woeful music that we have
 cause it to sound beseech you
 the viol once more how thou stirr'st thou block
 the music therei pray you give her air
 gentlemen
 this queen will live nature awakes a warmth
 breathes out of her she hath not been entranced
 above five hours see how she gins to blow
 into life's flower again
first gentleman the heavens
 through you increase our wonder and set up
 your fame forever
cerimon she is alive behold
 her eyelids cases to those heavenly jewels
 which pericles hath lost
 begin to part their fringes of bright gold
 the diamonds of a most praised water
 do appear to make the world twice rich live
 and make us weep to hear your fate fair creature
 rare as you seem to be
 she moves
thaisa o dear diana
 where am i where's my lord what world is this
second gentleman is not this strange
first gentleman most rare
cerimon hush my gentle neighbours
 lend me your hands to the next chamber bear her
 get linen now this matter must be look'd to
 for her relapse is mortal come come
 and aesculapius guide us
 exeunt carrying her away
 pericles prince of tyre
act iii
scene iii tarsus a room in cleon's house
 enter pericles cleon dionyza and lychorida with
 marina in her arms
pericles most honour'd cleon i must needs be gone
 my twelve months are expired and tyrus stands
 in a litigious peace you and your lady
 take from my heart all thankfulness the gods
 make up the rest upon you
cleon your shafts of fortune though they hurt you mortally
 yet glance full wanderingly on us
dionyza o your sweet queen
 that the strict fates had pleased you had brought her hither
 to have bless'd mine eyes with her
pericles we cannot but obey
 the powers above us could i rage and roar
 as doth the sea she lies in yet the end
 must be as tis my gentle babe marina whom
 for she was born at sea i have named so here
