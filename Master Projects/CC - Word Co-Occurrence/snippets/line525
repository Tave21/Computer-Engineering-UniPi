act i
scene ii padua before hortensio's house
 enter petruchio and his man grumio
petruchio verona for a while i take my leave
 to see my friends in padua but of all
 my best beloved and approved friend
 hortensio and i trow this is his house
 here sirrah grumio knock i say
grumio knock sir whom should i knock is there man has
 rebused your worship
petruchio villain i say knock me here soundly
grumio knock you here sir why sir what am i sir that
 i should knock you here sir
petruchio villain i say knock me at this gate
 and rap me well or i'll knock your knave's pate
grumio my master is grown quarrelsome i should knock
 you first
 and then i know after who comes by the worst
petruchio will it not be
 faith sirrah an you'll not knock i'll ring it
 i'll try how you can sol fa and sing it
 he wrings him by the ears
grumio help masters help my master is mad
petruchio now knock when i bid you sirrah villain
 enter hortensio
hortensio how now what's the matter my old friend grumio
 and my good friend petruchio how do you all at verona
petruchio signior hortensio come you to part the fray
 con tutto il cuore ben trovato may i say
hortensio alla nostra casa ben venuto molto honorato signor
 mio petruchio rise grumio rise we will compound
 this quarrel
grumio nay tis no matter sir what he leges in latin
 if this be not a lawful case for me to leave his
 service look you sir he bid me knock him and rap
 him soundly sir well was it fit for a servant to
 use his master so being perhaps for aught i see
 two and thirty a pip out whom would to god i had
 well knock'd at first then had not grumio come by the worst
petruchio a senseless villain good hortensio
 i bade the rascal knock upon your gate
 and could not get him for my heart to do it
grumio knock at the gate o heavens spake you not these
 words plain sirrah knock me here rap me here
 knock me well and knock me soundly and come you
 now with knocking at the gate'
petruchio sirrah be gone or talk not i advise you
hortensio petruchio patience i am grumio's pledge
 why this's a heavy chance twixt him and you
 your ancient trusty pleasant servant grumio
 and tell me now sweet friend what happy gale
 blows you to padua here from old verona
petruchio such wind as scatters young men through the world
 to seek their fortunes farther than at home
 where small experience grows but in a few
 signior hortensio thus it stands with me
 antonio my father is deceased
 and i have thrust myself into this maze
 haply to wive and thrive as best i may
 crowns in my purse i have and goods at home
 and so am come abroad to see the world
hortensio petruchio shall i then come roundly to thee
 and wish thee to a shrewd illfavour'd wife
 thou'ldst thank me but a little for my counsel
 and yet i'll promise thee she shall be rich
 and very rich but thou'rt too much my friend
 and i'll not wish thee to her
petruchio signior hortensio twixt such friends as we
 few words suffice and therefore if thou know
 one rich enough to be petruchio's wife
 as wealth is burden of my wooing dance
 be she as foul as was florentius love
 as old as sibyl and as curst and shrewd
 as socrates xanthippe or a worse
 she moves me not or not removes at least
 affection's edge in me were she as rough
 as are the swelling adriatic seas
 i come to wive it wealthily in padua
 if wealthily then happily in padua
grumio nay look you sir he tells you flatly what his
 mind is why give him gold enough and marry him to
 a puppet or an agletbaby or an old trot with ne'er
 a tooth in her head though she have as many diseases
 as two and fifty horses why nothing comes amiss
 so money comes withal
hortensio petruchio since we are stepp'd thus far in
 i will continue that i broach'd in jest
 i can petruchio help thee to a wife
 with wealth enough and young and beauteous
 brought up as best becomes a gentlewoman
 her only fault and that is faults enough
 is that she is intolerable curst
 and shrewd and froward so beyond all measure
 that were my state far worser than it is
 i would not wed her for a mine of gold
petruchio hortensio peace thou know'st not gold's effect
 tell me her father's name and tis enough
 for i will board her though she chide as loud
 as thunder when the clouds in autumn crack
hortensio her father is baptista minola
 an affable and courteous gentleman
 her name is katharina minola
 renown'd in padua for her scolding tongue
petruchio i know her father though i know not her
 and he knew my deceased father well
 i will not sleep hortensio till i see her
 and therefore let me be thus bold with you
 to give you over at this first encounter
 unless you will accompany me thither
grumio i pray you sir let him go while the humour lasts
 o my word an she knew him as well as i do she
 would think scolding would do little good upon him
 she may perhaps call him half a score knaves or so
 why that's nothing an he begin once he'll rail in
 his ropetricks i'll tell you what sir an she
 stand him but a little he will throw a figure in
 her face and so disfigure her with it that she
 shall have no more eyes to see withal than a cat
 you know him not sir
hortensio tarry petruchio i must go with thee
 for in baptista's keep my treasure is
 he hath the jewel of my life in hold
 his youngest daughter beautiful binaca
 and her withholds from me and other more
 suitors to her and rivals in my love
 supposing it a thing impossible
 for those defects i have before rehearsed
 that ever katharina will be woo'd
 therefore this order hath baptista ta'en
 that none shall have access unto bianca
 till katharina the curst have got a husband
grumio katharina the curst
