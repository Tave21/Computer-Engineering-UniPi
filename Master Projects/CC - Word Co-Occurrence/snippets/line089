for before the child shall know to refuse the evil and choose the good the land that thou abhorrest shall be forsaken of both her kings
the lord shall bring upon thee and upon thy people and upon thy father's house days that have not come from the day that ephraim departed from judah even the king of assyria
and it shall come to pass in that day that the lord shall hiss for the fly that is in the uttermost part of the rivers of egypt and for the bee that is in the land of assyria
and they shall come and shall rest all of them in the desolate valleys and in the holes of the rocks and upon all thorns and upon all bushes
in the same day shall the lord shave with a razor that is hired namely by them beyond the river by the king of assyria the head and the hair of the feet and it shall also consume the beard
and it shall come to pass in that day that a man shall nourish a young cow and two sheep
and it shall come to pass for the abundance of milk that they shall give he shall eat butter for butter and honey shall every one eat that is left in the land
and it shall come to pass in that day that every place shall be where there were a thousand vines at a thousand silverlings it shall even be for briers and thorns
with arrows and with bows shall men come thither because all the land shall become briers and thorns
and on all hills that shall be digged with the mattock there shall not come thither the fear of briers and thorns but it shall be for the sending forth of oxen and for the treading of lesser cattle
moreover the lord said unto me take thee a great roll and write in it with a man's pen concerning mahershalalhashbaz
and i took unto me faithful witnesses to record uriah the priest and zechariah the son of jeberechiah
and i went unto the prophetess and she conceived and bare a son then said the lord to me call his name mahershalalhashbaz
for before the child shall have knowledge to cry my father and my mother the riches of damascus and the spoil of samaria shall be taken away before the king of assyria
the lord spake also unto me again saying
forasmuch as this people refuseth the waters of shiloah that go softly and rejoice in rezin and remaliah's son
now therefore behold the lord bringeth up upon them the waters of the river strong and many even the king of assyria and all his glory and he shall come up over all his channels and go over all his banks
and he shall pass through judah he shall overflow and go over he shall reach even to the neck and the stretching out of his wings shall fill the breadth of thy land o immanuel
associate yourselves o ye people and ye shall be broken in pieces and give ear all ye of far countries gird yourselves and ye shall be broken in pieces gird yourselves and ye shall be broken in pieces
take counsel together and it shall come to nought speak the word and it shall not stand for god is with us
for the lord spake thus to me with a strong hand and instructed me that i should not walk in the way of this people saying
say ye not a confederacy to all them to whom this people shall say a confederacy neither fear ye their fear nor be afraid
sanctify the lord of hosts himself and let him be your fear and let him be your dread
and he shall be for a sanctuary but for a stone of stumbling and for a rock of offence to both the houses of israel for a gin and for a snare to the inhabitants of jerusalem
and many among them shall stumble and fall and be broken and be snared and be taken
bind up the testimony seal the law among my disciples
and i will wait upon the lord that hideth his face from the house of jacob and i will look for him
behold i and the children whom the lord hath given me are for signs and for wonders in israel from the lord of hosts which dwelleth in mount zion
and when they shall say unto you seek unto them that have familiar spirits and unto wizards that peep and that mutter should not a people seek unto their god for the living to the dead
to the law and to the testimony if they speak not according to this word it is because there is no light in them
and they shall pass through it hardly bestead and hungry and it shall come to pass that when they shall be hungry they shall fret themselves and curse their king and their god and look upward
and they shall look unto the earth and behold trouble and darkness dimness of anguish and they shall be driven to darkness
nevertheless the dimness shall not be such as was in her vexation when at the first he lightly afflicted the land of zebulun and the land of naphtali and afterward did more grievously afflict her by the way of the sea beyond jordan in galilee of the nations
the people that walked in darkness have seen a great light they that dwell in the land of the shadow of death upon them hath the light shined
thou hast multiplied the nation and not increased the joy they joy before thee according to the joy in harvest and as men rejoice when they divide the spoil
for thou hast broken the yoke of his burden and the staff of his shoulder the rod of his oppressor as in the day of midian
for every battle of the warrior is with confused noise and garments rolled in blood but this shall be with burning and fuel of fire
for unto us a child is born unto us a son is given and the government shall be upon his shoulder and his name shall be called wonderful counsellor the mighty god the everlasting father the prince of peace
of the increase of his government and peace there shall be no end upon the throne of david and upon his kingdom to order it and to establish it with judgment and with justice from henceforth even for ever the zeal of the lord of hosts will perform this
the lord sent a word into jacob and it hath lighted upon israel
and all the people shall know even ephraim and the inhabitant of samaria that say in the pride and stoutness of heart
the bricks are fallen down but we will build with hewn stones the sycomores are cut down but we will change them into cedars
therefore the lord shall set up the adversaries of rezin against him and join his enemies together
the syrians before and the philistines behind and they shall devour israel with open mouth for all this his anger is not turned away but his hand is stretched out still
for the people turneth not unto him that smiteth them neither do they seek the lord of hosts
therefore the lord will cut off from israel head and tail branch and rush in one day
the ancient and honourable he is the head and the prophet that teacheth lies he is the tail
for the leaders of this people cause them to err and they that are led of them are destroyed
therefore the lord shall have no joy in their young men neither shall have mercy on their fatherless and widows for every one is an hypocrite and an evildoer and every mouth speaketh folly for all this his anger is not turned away but his hand is stretched out still
for wickedness burneth as the fire it shall devour the briers and thorns and shall kindle in the thickets of the forest and they shall mount up like the lifting up of smoke
through the wrath of the lord of hosts is the land darkened and the people shall be as the fuel of the fire no man shall spare his brother
and he shall snatch on the right hand and be hungry and he shall eat on the left hand and they shall not be satisfied they shall eat every man the flesh of his own arm
manasseh ephraim and ephraim manasseh and they together shall be against judah for all this his anger is not turned away but his hand is stretched out still
woe unto them that decree unrighteous decrees and that write grievousness which they have prescribed
to turn aside the needy from judgment and to take away the right from the poor of my people that widows may be their prey and that they may rob the fatherless
and what will ye do in the day of visitation and in the desolation which shall come from far to whom will ye flee for help and where will ye leave your glory
without me they shall bow down under the prisoners and they shall fall under the slain for all this his anger is not turned away but his hand is stretched out still
o assyrian the rod of mine anger and the staff in their hand is mine indignation
i will send him against an hypocritical nation and against the people of my wrath will i give him a charge to take the spoil and to take the prey and to tread them down like the mire of the streets
howbeit he meaneth not so neither doth his heart think so but it is in his heart to destroy and cut off nations not a few
for he saith are not my princes altogether kings
is not calno as carchemish is not hamath as arpad is not samaria as damascus
as my hand hath found the kingdoms of the idols and whose graven images did excel them of jerusalem and of samaria
shall i not as i have done unto samaria and her idols so do to jerusalem and her idols
wherefore it shall come to pass that when the lord hath performed his whole work upon mount zion and on jerusalem i will punish the fruit of the stout heart of the king of assyria and the glory of his high looks
for he saith by the strength of my hand i have done it and by my wisdom for i am prudent and i have removed the bounds of the people and have robbed their treasures and i have put down the inhabitants like a valiant man
and my hand hath found as a nest the riches of the people and as one gathereth eggs that are left have i gathered all the earth and there was none that moved the wing or opened the mouth or peeped
shall the axe boast itself against him that heweth therewith or shall the saw magnify itself against him that shaketh it as if the rod should shake itself against them that lift it up or as if the staff should lift up itself as if it were no wood
therefore shall the lord the lord of hosts send among his fat ones leanness and under his glory he shall kindle a burning like the burning of a fire
and the light of israel shall be for a fire and his holy one for a flame and it shall burn and devour his thorns and his briers in one day
and shall consume the glory of his forest and of his fruitful field both soul and body and they shall be as when a standardbearer fainteth
and the rest of the trees of his forest shall be few that a child may write them
and it shall come to pass in that day that the remnant of israel and such as are escaped of the house of jacob shall no more again stay upon him that smote them but shall stay upon the lord the holy one of israel in truth
the remnant shall return even the remnant of jacob unto the mighty god
for though thy people israel be as the sand of the sea yet a remnant of them shall return the consumption decreed shall overflow with righteousness
for the lord god of hosts shall make a consumption even determined in the midst of all the land
therefore thus saith the lord god of hosts o my people that dwellest in zion be not afraid of the assyrian he shall smite thee with a rod and shall lift up his staff against thee after the manner of egypt
for yet a very little while and the indignation shall cease and mine anger in their destruction
and the lord of hosts shall stir up a scourge for him according to the slaughter of midian at the rock of oreb and as his rod was upon the sea so shall he lift it up after the manner of egypt
and it shall come to pass in that day that his burden shall be taken away from off thy shoulder and his yoke from off thy neck and the yoke shall be destroyed because of the anointing
he is come to aiath he is passed to migron at michmash he hath laid up his carriages
they are gone over the passage they have taken up their lodging at geba ramah is afraid gibeah of saul is fled
lift up thy voice o daughter of gallim cause it to be heard unto laish o poor anathoth
madmenah is removed the inhabitants of gebim gather themselves to flee
as yet shall he remain at nob that day he shall shake his hand against the mount of the daughter of zion the hill of jerusalem
behold the lord the lord of hosts shall lop the bough with terror and the high ones of stature shall be hewn down and the haughty shall be humbled
and he shall cut down the thickets of the forest with iron and lebanon shall fall by a mighty one
and there shall come forth a rod out of the stem of jesse and a branch shall grow out of his roots
and the spirit of the lord shall rest upon him the spirit of wisdom and understanding the spirit of counsel and might the spirit of knowledge and of the fear of the lord
and shall make him of quick understanding in the fear of the lord and he shall not judge after the sight of his eyes neither reprove after the hearing of his ears
but with righteousness shall he judge the poor and reprove with equity for the meek of the earth and he shall smite the earth with the rod of his mouth and with the breath of his lips shall he slay the wicked
and righteousness shall be the girdle of his loins and faithfulness the girdle of his reins
the wolf also shall dwell with the lamb and the leopard shall lie down with the kid and the calf and the young lion and the fatling together and a little child shall lead them
and the cow and the bear shall feed their young ones shall lie down together and the lion shall eat straw like the ox
and the sucking child shall play on the hole of the asp and the weaned child shall put his hand on the cockatrice den
they shall not hurt nor destroy in all my holy mountain for the earth shall be full of the knowledge of the lord as the waters cover the sea
and in that day there shall be a root of jesse which shall stand for an ensign of the people to it shall the gentiles seek and his rest shall be glorious
and it shall come to pass in that day that the lord shall set his hand again the second time to recover the remnant of his people which shall be left from assyria and from egypt and from pathros and from cush and from elam and from shinar and from hamath and from the islands of the sea
and he shall set up an ensign for the nations and shall assemble the outcasts of israel and gather together the dispersed of judah from the four corners of the earth
the envy also of ephraim shall depart and the adversaries of judah shall be cut off ephraim shall not envy judah and judah shall not vex ephraim
but they shall fly upon the shoulders of the philistines toward the west they shall spoil them of the east together they shall lay their hand upon edom and moab and the children of ammon shall obey them
and the lord shall utterly destroy the tongue of the egyptian sea and with his mighty wind shall he shake his hand over the river and shall smite it in the seven streams and make men go over dryshod
and there shall be an highway for the remnant of his people which shall be left from assyria like as it was to israel in the day that he came up out of the land of egypt
and in that day thou shalt say o lord i will praise thee though thou wast angry with me thine anger is turned away and thou comfortedst me
behold god is my salvation i will trust and not be afraid for the lord jehovah is my strength and my song he also is become my salvation
therefore with joy shall ye draw water out of the wells of salvation
and in that day shall ye say praise the lord call upon his name declare his doings among the people make mention that his name is exalted
sing unto the lord for he hath done excellent things this is known in all the earth
cry out and shout thou inhabitant of zion for great is the holy one of israel in the midst of thee
the burden of babylon which isaiah the son of amoz did see
lift ye up a banner upon the high mountain exalt the voice unto them shake the hand that they may go into the gates of the nobles
i have commanded my sanctified ones i have also called my mighty ones for mine anger even them that rejoice in my highness
the noise of a multitude in the mountains like as of a great people a tumultuous noise of the kingdoms of nations gathered together the lord of hosts mustereth the host of the battle
they come from a far country from the end of heaven even the lord and the weapons of his indignation to destroy the whole land
howl ye for the day of the lord is at hand it shall come as a destruction from the almighty
therefore shall all hands be faint and every man's heart shall melt
and they shall be afraid pangs and sorrows shall take hold of them they shall be in pain as a woman that travaileth they shall be amazed one at another their faces shall be as flames
behold the day of the lord cometh cruel both with wrath and fierce anger to lay the land desolate and he shall destroy the sinners thereof out of it
for the stars of heaven and the constellations thereof shall not give their light the sun shall be darkened in his going forth and the moon shall not cause her light to shine
and i will punish the world for their evil and the wicked for their iniquity and i will cause the arrogancy of the proud to cease and will lay low the haughtiness of the terrible
i will make a man more precious than fine gold even a man than the golden wedge of ophir
therefore i will shake the heavens and the earth shall remove out of her place in the wrath of the lord of hosts and in the day of his fierce anger
and it shall be as the chased roe and as a sheep that no man taketh up they shall every man turn to his own people and flee every one into his own land
every one that is found shall be thrust through and every one that is joined unto them shall fall by the sword
their children also shall be dashed to pieces before their eyes their houses shall be spoiled and their wives ravished
behold i will stir up the medes against them which shall not regard silver and as for gold they shall not delight in it
their bows also shall dash the young men to pieces and they shall have no pity on the fruit of the womb their eye shall not spare children
and babylon the glory of kingdoms the beauty of the chaldees excellency shall be as when god overthrew sodom and gomorrah
it shall never be inhabited neither shall it be dwelt in from generation to generation neither shall the arabian pitch tent there neither shall the shepherds make their fold there
but wild beasts of the desert shall lie there and their houses shall be full of doleful creatures and owls shall dwell there and satyrs shall dance there
and the wild beasts of the islands shall cry in their desolate houses and dragons in their pleasant palaces and her time is near to come and her days shall not be prolonged
for the lord will have mercy on jacob and will yet choose israel and set them in their own land and the strangers shall be joined with them and they shall cleave to the house of jacob
and the people shall take them and bring them to their place and the house of israel shall possess them in the land of the lord for servants and handmaids and they shall take them captives whose captives they were and they shall rule over their oppressors
and it shall come to pass in the day that the lord shall give thee rest from thy sorrow and from thy fear and from the hard bondage wherein thou wast made to serve
that thou shalt take up this proverb against the king of babylon and say how hath the oppressor ceased the golden city ceased
the lord hath broken the staff of the wicked and the sceptre of the rulers
he who smote the people in wrath with a continual stroke he that ruled the nations in anger is persecuted and none hindereth
the whole earth is at rest and is quiet they break forth into singing
yea the fir trees rejoice at thee and the cedars of lebanon saying since thou art laid down no feller is come up against us
hell from beneath is moved for thee to meet thee at thy coming it stirreth up the dead for thee even all the chief ones of the earth it hath raised up from their thrones all the kings of the nations
all they shall speak and say unto thee art thou also become weak as we art thou become like unto us
thy pomp is brought down to the grave and the noise of thy viols the worm is spread under thee and the worms cover thee
how art thou fallen from heaven o lucifer son of the morning how art thou cut down to the ground which didst weaken the nations
for thou hast said in thine heart i will ascend into heaven i will exalt my throne above the stars of god i will sit also upon the mount of the congregation in the sides of the north
i will ascend above the heights of the clouds i will be like the most high
yet thou shalt be brought down to hell to the sides of the pit
they that see thee shall narrowly look upon thee and consider thee saying is this the man that made the earth to tremble that did shake kingdoms
that made the world as a wilderness and destroyed the cities thereof that opened not the house of his prisoners
all the kings of the nations even all of them lie in glory every one in his own house
but thou art cast out of thy grave like an abominable branch and as the raiment of those that are slain thrust through with a sword that go down to the stones of the pit as a carcase trodden under feet
thou shalt not be joined with them in burial because thou hast destroyed thy land and slain thy people the seed of evildoers shall never be renowned
prepare slaughter for his children for the iniquity of their fathers that they do not rise nor possess the land nor fill the face of the world with cities
for i will rise up against them saith the lord of hosts and cut off from babylon the name and remnant and son and nephew saith the lord
i will also make it a possession for the bittern and pools of water and i will sweep it with the besom of destruction saith the lord of hosts
the lord of hosts hath sworn saying surely as i have thought so shall it come to pass and as i have purposed so shall it stand
that i will break the assyrian in my land and upon my mountains tread him under foot then shall his yoke depart from off them and his burden depart from off their shoulders
this is the purpose that is purposed upon the whole earth and this is the hand that is stretched out upon all the nations
for the lord of hosts hath purposed and who shall disannul it and his hand is stretched out and who shall turn it back
in the year that king ahaz died was this burden
rejoice not thou whole palestina because the rod of him that smote thee is broken for out of the serpent's root shall come forth a cockatrice and his fruit shall be a fiery flying serpent
and the firstborn of the poor shall feed and the needy shall lie down in safety and i will kill thy root with famine and he shall slay thy remnant
howl o gate cry o city thou whole palestina art dissolved for there shall come from the north a smoke and none shall be alone in his appointed times
what shall one then answer the messengers of the nation that the lord hath founded zion and the poor of his people shall trust in it
the burden of moab because in the night ar of moab is laid waste and brought to silence because in the night kir of moab is laid waste and brought to silence
he is gone up to bajith and to dibon the high places to weep moab shall howl over nebo and over medeba on all their heads shall be baldness and every beard cut off
in their streets they shall gird themselves with sackcloth on the tops of their houses and in their streets every one shall howl weeping abundantly
and heshbon shall cry and elealeh their voice shall be heard even unto jahaz therefore the armed soldiers of moab shall cry out his life shall be grievous unto him
my heart shall cry out for moab his fugitives shall flee unto zoar an heifer of three years old for by the mounting up of luhith with weeping shall they go it up for in the way of horonaim they shall raise up a cry of destruction
for the waters of nimrim shall be desolate for the hay is withered away the grass faileth there is no green thing
therefore the abundance they have gotten and that which they have laid up shall they carry away to the brook of the willows
for the cry is gone round about the borders of moab the howling thereof unto eglaim and the howling thereof unto beerelim
for the waters of dimon shall be full of blood for i will bring more upon dimon lions upon him that escapeth of moab and upon the remnant of the land
send ye the lamb to the ruler of the land from sela to the wilderness unto the mount of the daughter of zion
for it shall be that as a wandering bird cast out of the nest so the daughters of moab shall be at the fords of arnon
take counsel execute judgment make thy shadow as the night in the midst of the noonday hide the outcasts bewray not him that wandereth
let mine outcasts dwell with thee moab be thou a covert to them from the face of the spoiler for the extortioner is at an end the spoiler ceaseth the oppressors are consumed out of the land
and in mercy shall the throne be established and he shall sit upon it in truth in the tabernacle of david judging and seeking judgment and hasting righteousness
we have heard of the pride of moab he is very proud even of his haughtiness and his pride and his wrath but his lies shall not be so
therefore shall moab howl for moab every one shall howl for the foundations of kirhareseth shall ye mourn surely they are stricken
for the fields of heshbon languish and the vine of sibmah the lords of the heathen have broken down the principal plants thereof they are come even unto jazer they wandered through the wilderness her branches are stretched out they are gone over the sea
therefore i will bewail with the weeping of jazer the vine of sibmah i will water thee with my tears o heshbon and elealeh for the shouting for thy summer fruits and for thy harvest is fallen
and gladness is taken away and joy out of the plentiful field and in the vineyards there shall be no singing neither shall there be shouting the treaders shall tread out no wine in their presses i have made their vintage shouting to cease
wherefore my bowels shall sound like an harp for moab and mine inward parts for kirharesh
and it shall come to pass when it is seen that moab is weary on the high place that he shall come to his sanctuary to pray but he shall not prevail
this is the word that the lord hath spoken concerning moab since that time
but now the lord hath spoken saying within three years as the years of an hireling and the glory of moab shall be contemned with all that great multitude and the remnant shall be very small and feeble
the burden of damascus behold damascus is taken away from being a city and it shall be a ruinous heap
the cities of aroer are forsaken they shall be for flocks which shall lie down and none shall make them afraid
the fortress also shall cease from ephraim and the kingdom from damascus and the remnant of syria they shall be as the glory of the children of israel saith the lord of hosts
and in that day it shall come to pass that the glory of jacob shall be made thin and the fatness of his flesh shall wax lean
and it shall be as when the harvestman gathereth the corn and reapeth the ears with his arm and it shall be as he that gathereth ears in the valley of rephaim
yet gleaning grapes shall be left in it as the shaking of an olive tree two or three berries in the top of the uppermost bough four or five in the outmost fruitful branches thereof saith the lord god of israel
at that day shall a man look to his maker and his eyes shall have respect to the holy one of israel
and he shall not look to the altars the work of his hands neither shall respect that which his fingers have made either the groves or the images
in that day shall his strong cities be as a forsaken bough and an uppermost branch which they left because of the children of israel and there shall be desolation
because thou hast forgotten the god of thy salvation and hast not been mindful of the rock of thy strength therefore shalt thou plant pleasant plants and shalt set it with strange slips
in the day shalt thou make thy plant to grow and in the morning shalt thou make thy seed to flourish but the harvest shall be a heap in the day of grief and of desperate sorrow
woe to the multitude of many people which make a noise like the noise of the seas and to the rushing of nations that make a rushing like the rushing of mighty waters
the nations shall rush like the rushing of many waters but god shall rebuke them and they shall flee far off and shall be chased as the chaff of the mountains before the wind and like a rolling thing before the whirlwind
and behold at eveningtide trouble and before the morning he is not this is the portion of them that spoil us and the lot of them that rob us
