first witch he knows thy thought
 hear his speech but say thou nought
first apparition macbeth macbeth macbeth beware macduff
 beware the thane of fife dismiss me enough
 descends
macbeth whate'er thou art for thy good caution thanks
 thou hast harp'd my fear aright but one
 word more
first witch he will not be commanded here's another
 more potent than the first
 thunder second apparition a bloody child
second apparition macbeth macbeth macbeth
macbeth had i three ears i'ld hear thee
second apparition be bloody bold and resolute laugh to scorn
 the power of man for none of woman born
 shall harm macbeth
 descends
macbeth then live macduff what need i fear of thee
 but yet i'll make assurance double sure
 and take a bond of fate thou shalt not live
 that i may tell palehearted fear it lies
 and sleep in spite of thunder
 thunder third apparition a child crowned
 with a tree in his hand
 what is this
 that rises like the issue of a king
 and wears upon his babybrow the round
 and top of sovereignty
all listen but speak not to't
third apparition be lionmettled proud and take no care
 who chafes who frets or where conspirers are
 macbeth shall never vanquish'd be until
 great birnam wood to high dunsinane hill
 shall come against him
 descends
macbeth that will never be
 who can impress the forest bid the tree
 unfix his earthbound root sweet bodements good
 rebellion's head rise never till the wood
 of birnam rise and our highplaced macbeth
 shall live the lease of nature pay his breath
 to time and mortal custom yet my heart
 throbs to know one thing tell me if your art
 can tell so much shall banquo's issue ever
 reign in this kingdom
all seek to know no more
macbeth i will be satisfied deny me this
 and an eternal curse fall on you let me know
 why sinks that cauldron and what noise is this
 hautboys
first witch show
second witch show
third witch show
all show his eyes and grieve his heart
 come like shadows so depart
 a show of eight kings the last with a glass in
 his hand ghost of banquo following
macbeth thou art too like the spirit of banquo down
 thy crown does sear mine eyeballs and thy hair
 thou other goldbound brow is like the first
 a third is like the former filthy hags
 why do you show me this a fourth start eyes
 what will the line stretch out to the crack of doom
 another yet a seventh i'll see no more
 and yet the eighth appears who bears a glass
 which shows me many more and some i see
 that twofold balls and treble scepters carry
 horrible sight now i see tis true
 for the bloodbolter'd banquo smiles upon me
 and points at them for his
 apparitions vanish
 what is this so
first witch ay sir all this is so but why
 stands macbeth thus amazedly
 come sisters cheer we up his sprites
 and show the best of our delights
 i'll charm the air to give a sound
 while you perform your antic round
 that this great king may kindly say
 our duties did his welcome pay
 music the witches dance and then vanish
 with hecate
macbeth where are they gone let this pernicious hour
 stand aye accursed in the calendar
 come in without there

macbeth saw you the weird sisters

 the firstlings of my hand and even now
 to crown my thoughts with acts be it thought and done

act iv
scene ii fife macduff's castle
 enter lady macduff her son and ross
lady macduff what had he done to make him fly the land
ross you must have patience madam
lady macduff he had none
 his flight was madness when our actions do not
 our fears do make us traitors
ross you know not
 whether it was his wisdom or his fear
lady macduff wisdom to leave his wife to leave his babes
 his mansion and his titles in a place
 from whence himself does fly he loves us not
 he wants the natural touch for the poor wren
 the most diminutive of birds will fight
 her young ones in her nest against the owl
 all is the fear and nothing is the love
 as little is the wisdom where the flight
 so runs against all reason
ross my dearest coz
 i pray you school yourself but for your husband
 he is noble wise judicious and best knows
 the fits o the season i dare not speak
 much further
 but cruel are the times when we are traitors
 and do not know ourselves when we hold rumour
 from what we fear yet know not what we fear
 but float upon a wild and violent sea
 each way and move i take my leave of you
 shall not be long but i'll be here again
 things at the worst will cease or else climb upward
 to what they were before my pretty cousin
 blessing upon you
lady macduff father'd he is and yet he's fatherless
ross i am so much a fool should i stay longer
 it would be my disgrace and your discomfort
 i take my leave at once
 exit
lady macduff sirrah your father's dead
 and what will you do now how will you live
son as birds do mother
lady macduff what with worms and flies
son with what i get i mean and so do they
lady macduff poor bird thou'ldst never fear the net nor lime
 the pitfall nor the gin
son why should i mother poor birds they are not set for
 my father is not dead for all your saying
lady macduff yes he is dead how wilt thou do for a father
son nay how will you do for a husband
lady macduff why i can buy me twenty at any market
son then you'll buy em to sell again
lady macduff thou speak'st with all thy wit and yet i faith
 with wit enough for thee
son was my father a traitor mother
lady macduff ay that he was
son what is a traitor
lady macduff why one that swears and lies
son and be all traitors that do so
lady macduff every one that does so is a traitor and must be hanged
son and must they all be hanged that swear and lie
lady macduff every one
son who must hang them
lady macduff why the honest men
son then the liars and swearers are fools
 for there are liars and swearers enow to beat
 the honest men and hang up them
lady macduff now god help thee poor monkey
 but how wilt thou do for a father
son if he were dead you'ld weep for
 him if you would not it were a good sign
 that i should quickly have a new father
lady macduff poor prattler how thou talk'st
 enter a messenger
messenger bless you fair dame i am not to you known
 though in your state of honour i am perfect
 i doubt some danger does approach you nearly
 if you will take a homely man's advice
 be not found here hence with your little ones
 to fright you thus methinks i am too savage
 to do worse to you were fell cruelty
 which is too nigh your person heaven preserve you
 i dare abide no longer
 exit
