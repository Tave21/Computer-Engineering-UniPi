 let all my sins lack mercy o my father
 prove you that any man with me conversed
 at hours unmeet or that i yesternight
 maintain'd the change of words with any creature
 refuse me hate me torture me to death
friar francis there is some strange misprision in the princes
benedick two of them have the very bent of honour
 and if their wisdoms be misled in this
 the practise of it lives in john the bastard
 whose spirits toil in frame of villanies
leonato i know not if they speak but truth of her
 these hands shall tear her if they wrong her honour
 the proudest of them shall well hear of it
 time hath not yet so dried this blood of mine
 nor age so eat up my invention
 nor fortune made such havoc of my means
 nor my bad life reft me so much of friends
 but they shall find awaked in such a kind
 both strength of limb and policy of mind
 ability in means and choice of friends
 to quit me of them throughly
friar francis pause awhile
 and let my counsel sway you in this case
 your daughter here the princes left for dead
 let her awhile be secretly kept in
 and publish it that she is dead indeed
 maintain a mourning ostentation
 and on your family's old monument
 hang mournful epitaphs and do all rites
 that appertain unto a burial
leonato what shall become of this what will this do
friar francis marry this well carried shall on her behalf
 change slander to remorse that is some good
 but not for that dream i on this strange course
 but on this travail look for greater birth
 she dying as it must so be maintain'd
 upon the instant that she was accused
 shall be lamented pitied and excused
 of every hearer for it so falls out
 that what we have we prize not to the worth
 whiles we enjoy it but being lack'd and lost
 why then we rack the value then we find
 the virtue that possession would not show us
 whiles it was ours so will it fare with claudio
 when he shall hear she died upon his words
 the idea of her life shall sweetly creep
 into his study of imagination
 and every lovely organ of her life
 shall come apparell'd in more precious habit
 more movingdelicate and full of life
 into the eye and prospect of his soul
 than when she lived indeed then shall he mourn
 if ever love had interest in his liver
 and wish he had not so accused her
 no though he thought his accusation true
 let this be so and doubt not but success
 will fashion the event in better shape
 than i can lay it down in likelihood
 but if all aim but this be levell'd false
 the supposition of the lady's death
 will quench the wonder of her infamy
 and if it sort not well you may conceal her
 as best befits her wounded reputation
 in some reclusive and religious life
 out of all eyes tongues minds and injuries
benedick signior leonato let the friar advise you
 and though you know my inwardness and love
 is very much unto the prince and claudio
 yet by mine honour i will deal in this
 as secretly and justly as your soul
 should with your body
leonato being that i flow in grief
 the smallest twine may lead me
friar francis tis well consented presently away
 for to strange sores strangely they strain the cure
 come lady die to live this weddingday
 perhaps is but prolong'd have patience and endure
 exeunt all but benedick and beatrice
benedick lady beatrice have you wept all this while
beatrice yea and i will weep a while longer
benedick i will not desire that
beatrice you have no reason i do it freely
benedick surely i do believe your fair cousin is wronged
beatrice ah how much might the man deserve of me that would right her
benedick is there any way to show such friendship
beatrice a very even way but no such friend
benedick may a man do it
beatrice it is a man's office but not yours
benedick i do love nothing in the world so well as you is
 not that strange
beatrice as strange as the thing i know not it were as
 possible for me to say i loved nothing so well as
 you but believe me not and yet i lie not i
 confess nothing nor i deny nothing i am sorry for my cousin
benedick by my sword beatrice thou lovest me
beatrice do not swear and eat it
benedick i will swear by it that you love me and i will make
 him eat it that says i love not you
beatrice will you not eat your word
benedick with no sauce that can be devised to it i protest
 i love thee
beatrice why then god forgive me
benedick what offence sweet beatrice
beatrice you have stayed me in a happy hour i was about to
 protest i loved you
benedick and do it with all thy heart
beatrice i love you with so much of my heart that none is
 left to protest
benedick come bid me do any thing for thee
beatrice kill claudio
benedick ha not for the wide world
beatrice you kill me to deny it farewell
benedick tarry sweet beatrice
beatrice i am gone though i am here there is no love in
 you nay i pray you let me go
benedick beatrice
beatrice in faith i will go
benedick we'll be friends first
beatrice you dare easier be friends with me than fight with mine enemy
benedick is claudio thine enemy
beatrice is he not approved in the height a villain that
 hath slandered scorned dishonoured my kinswoman o
 that i were a man what bear her in hand until they
 come to take hands and then with public
 accusation uncovered slander unmitigated rancour
 o god that i were a man i would eat his heart
 in the marketplace
benedick hear me beatrice
beatrice talk with a man out at a window a proper saying
benedick nay but beatrice
beatrice sweet hero she is wronged she is slandered she is undone
benedick beat
beatrice princes and counties surely a princely testimony
 a goodly count count comfect a sweet gallant
 surely o that i were a man for his sake or that i
 had any friend would be a man for my sake but
 manhood is melted into courtesies valour into
 compliment and men are only turned into tongue and
 trim ones too he is now as valiant as hercules
 that only tells a lie and swears it i cannot be a
 man with wishing therefore i will die a woman with grieving
benedick tarry good beatrice by this hand i love thee
beatrice use it for my love some other way than swearing by it
benedick think you in your soul the count claudio hath wronged hero
beatrice yea as sure as i have a thought or a soul
benedick enough i am engaged i will challenge him i will
 kiss your hand and so i leave you by this hand
 claudio shall render me a dear account as you
 hear of me so think of me go comfort your
 cousin i must say she is dead and so farewell
 exeunt
