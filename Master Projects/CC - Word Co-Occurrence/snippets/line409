 in our notfearing britain than have tidings
 of any penny tribute paid our countrymen
 are men more order'd than when julius caesar
 smiled at their lack of skill but found
 their courage
 worthy his frowning at their discipline
 now mingled with their courages will make known
 to their approvers they are people such
 that mend upon the world
 enter iachimo
philario see iachimo
posthumus leonatus the swiftest harts have posted you by land
 and winds of all the comers kiss'd your sails
 to make your vessel nimble
philario welcome sir
posthumus leonatus i hope the briefness of your answer made
 the speediness of your return
iachimo your lady
 is one of the fairest that i have look'd upon
posthumus leonatus and therewithal the best or let her beauty
 look through a casement to allure false hearts
 and be false with them
iachimo here are letters for you
posthumus leonatus their tenor good i trust
iachimo tis very like
philario was caius lucius in the britain court
 when you were there
iachimo he was expected then
 but not approach'd
posthumus leonatus all is well yet
 sparkles this stone as it was wont or is't not
 too dull for your good wearing
iachimo if i had lost it
 i should have lost the worth of it in gold
 i'll make a journey twice as far to enjoy
 a second night of such sweet shortness which
 was mine in britain for the ring is won
posthumus leonatus the stone's too hard to come by
iachimo not a whit
 your lady being so easy
posthumus leonatus make not sir
 your loss your sport i hope you know that we
 must not continue friends
iachimo good sir we must
 if you keep covenant had i not brought
 the knowledge of your mistress home i grant
 we were to question further but i now
 profess myself the winner of her honour
 together with your ring and not the wronger
 of her or you having proceeded but
 by both your wills
posthumus leonatus if you can make't apparent
 that you have tasted her in bed my hand
 and ring is yours if not the foul opinion
 you had of her pure honour gains or loses
 your sword or mine or masterless leaves both
 to who shall find them
iachimo sir my circumstances
 being so near the truth as i will make them
 must first induce you to believe whose strength
 i will confirm with oath which i doubt not
 you'll give me leave to spare when you shall find
 you need it not
posthumus leonatus proceed
iachimo first her bedchamber
 where i confess i slept not but profess
 had that was well worth watchingit was hang'd
 with tapesty of silk and silver the story
 proud cleopatra when she met her roman
 and cydnus swell'd above the banks or for
 the press of boats or pride a piece of work
 so bravely done so rich that it did strive
 in workmanship and value which i wonder'd
 could be so rarely and exactly wrought
 since the true life on't was
posthumus leonatus this is true
 and this you might have heard of here by me
 or by some other
iachimo more particulars
 must justify my knowledge
posthumus leonatus so they must
 or do your honour injury
iachimo the chimney
 is south the chamber and the chimneypiece
 chaste dian bathing never saw i figures
 so likely to report themselves the cutter
 was as another nature dumb outwent her
 motion and breath left out
posthumus leonatus this is a thing
 which you might from relation likewise reap
 being as it is much spoke of
iachimo the roof o the chamber
 with golden cherubins is fretted her andirons
 i had forgot themwere two winking cupids
 of silver each on one foot standing nicely
 depending on their brands
posthumus leonatus this is her honour
 let it be granted you have seen all thisand praise
 be given to your remembrancethe description
 of what is in her chamber nothing saves
 the wager you have laid
iachimo then if you can
 showing the bracelet
 be pale i beg but leave to air this jewel see
 and now tis up again it must be married
 to that your diamond i'll keep them
posthumus leonatus jove
 once more let me behold it is it that
 which i left with her
iachimo siri thank herthat
 she stripp'd it from her arm i see her yet
 her pretty action did outsell her gift
 and yet enrich'd it too she gave it me and said
 she prized it once
posthumus leonatus may be she pluck'd it off
 to send it me
iachimo she writes so to you doth she
posthumus leonatus o no no no tis true here take this too
 gives the ring
 it is a basilisk unto mine eye
 kills me to look on't let there be no honour
 where there is beauty truth where semblance love
 where there's another man the vows of women
 of no more bondage be to where they are made
 than they are to their virtues which is nothing
 o above measure false
philario have patience sir
 and take your ring again tis not yet won
 it may be probable she lost it or
 who knows if one of her women being corrupted
 hath stol'n it from her
posthumus leonatus very true
 and so i hope he came by't back my ring
 render to me some corporal sign about her
 more evident than this for this was stolen
iachimo by jupiter i had it from her arm
posthumus leonatus hark you he swears by jupiter he swears
 tis truenay keep the ring'tis true i am sure
 she would not lose it her attendants are
 all sworn and honourablethey induced to steal it
 and by a strangerno he hath enjoyed her
 the cognizance of her incontinency
 is this she hath bought the name of whore
 thus dearly
 there take thy hire and all the fiends of hell
 divide themselves between you
philario sir be patient
 this is not strong enough to be believed
 of one persuaded well of
posthumus leonatus never talk on't
 she hath been colted by him
iachimo if you seek
 for further satisfying under her breast
 worthy the pressinglies a mole right proud
 of that most delicate lodging by my life
 i kiss'd it and it gave me present hunger
 to feed again though full you do remember
 this stain upon her
posthumus leonatus ay and it doth confirm
 another stain as big as hell can hold
 were there no more but it
iachimo will you hear more
posthumus leonatus spare your arithmetic never count the turns
 once and a million
iachimo i'll be sworn
posthumus leonatus no swearing
 if you will swear you have not done't you lie
 and i will kill thee if thou dost deny
 thou'st made me cuckold
iachimo i'll deny nothing
posthumus leonatus o that i had her here to tear her limbmeal
 i will go there and do't i the court before
 her father i'll do something
 exit
philario quite besides
 the government of patience you have won
 let's follow him and pervert the present wrath
 he hath against himself
iachimo with an my heart
 exeunt
 cymbeline
act ii
scene v another room in philario's house
 enter posthumus leonatus
posthumus leonatus is there no way for men to be but women
 must be halfworkers we are all bastards
 and that most venerable man which i
 did call my father was i know not where
 when i was stamp'd some coiner with his tools
 made me a counterfeit yet my mother seem'd
 the dian of that time so doth my wife
 the nonpareil of this o vengeance vengeance
 me of my lawful pleasure she restrain'd
 and pray'd me oft forbearance did it with
 a pudency so rosy the sweet view on't
 might well have warm'd old saturn that i thought her
 as chaste as unsunn'd snow o all the devils
 this yellow iachimo in an hourwast not
 or lessat firstperchance he spoke not but
 like a fullacorn'd boar a german one
