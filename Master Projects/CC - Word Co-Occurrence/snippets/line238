 given him notice that the duke of cornwall and regan
 his duchess will be here with him this night

 earkissing arguments

curan have you heard of no likely wars toward twixt the
 dukes of cornwall and albany
edmund not a word
curan you may do then in time fare you well sir
 exit
edmund the duke be here tonight the better best
 this weaves itself perforce into my business

 and i have one thing of a queasy question
 which i must act briefness and fortune work
 brother a word descend brother i say
 enter edgar
 my father watches o sir fly this place
 intelligence is given where you are hid
 you have now the good advantage of the night
 have you not spoken gainst the duke of cornwall

 and regan with him have you nothing said
 upon his party gainst the duke of albany

 some blood drawn on me would beget opinion
 wounds his arm
 of my more fierce endeavour i have seen drunkards
 do more than this in sport father father
 stop stop no help
 enter gloucester and servants with torches
gloucester now edmund where's the villain
edmund here stood he in the dark his sharp sword out
 mumbling of wicked charms conjuring the moon
 to stand auspicious mistress
gloucester but where is he
edmund look sir i bleed
gloucester where is the villain edmund
edmund fled this way sir when by no means he could
gloucester pursue him ho go after
 exeunt some servants
 by no means what
edmund persuade me to the murder of your lordship
 but that i told him the revenging gods
 gainst parricides did all their thunders bend
 spoke with how manifold and strong a bond
 the child was bound to the father sir in fine
 seeing how loathly opposite i stood
 to his unnatural purpose in fell motion
 with his prepared sword he charges home
 my unprovided body lanced mine arm
 but when he saw my best alarum'd spirits
 bold in the quarrel's right roused to the encounter
 or whether gasted by the noise i made
 full suddenly he fled
gloucester let him fly far
 not in this land shall he remain uncaught
 and founddispatch the noble duke my master
 my worthy arch and patron comes tonight
 by his authority i will proclaim it
 that he which finds him shall deserve our thanks
 bringing the murderous coward to the stake
 he that conceals him death
edmund when i dissuaded him from his intent
 and found him pight to do it with curst speech
 i threaten'd to discover him he replied
 thou unpossessing bastard dost thou think
 if i would stand against thee would the reposal
 of any trust virtue or worth in thee
 make thy words faith'd no what i should deny
 as this i would ay though thou didst produce
 my very characteri'ld turn it all
 to thy suggestion plot and damned practise
 and thou must make a dullard of the world
 if they not thought the profits of my death
 were very pregnant and potential spurs
 to make thee seek it'
gloucester strong and fasten'd villain
 would he deny his letter i never got him
 tucket within
 hark the duke's trumpets i know not why he comes
 all ports i'll bar the villain shall not scape
 the duke must grant me that besides his picture
 i will send far and near that all the kingdom
 may have the due note of him and of my land
 loyal and natural boy i'll work the means
 to make thee capable
 enter cornwall regan and attendants
cornwall how now my noble friend since i came hither
 which i can call but now i have heard strange news
regan if it be true all vengeance comes too short
 which can pursue the offender how dost my lord
gloucester o madam my old heart is crack'd it's crack'd
regan what did my father's godson seek your life
 he whom my father named your edgar
gloucester o lady lady shame would have it hid
regan was he not companion with the riotous knights
 that tend upon my father
gloucester i know not madam tis too bad too bad
edmund yes madam he was of that consort
regan no marvel then though he were ill affected
 tis they have put him on the old man's death
 to have the expense and waste of his revenues
 i have this present evening from my sister
 been well inform'd of them and with such cautions
 that if they come to sojourn at my house
 i'll not be there
cornwall nor i assure thee regan
 edmund i hear that you have shown your father
 a childlike office
edmund twas my duty sir
gloucester he did bewray his practise and received
 this hurt you see striving to apprehend him
cornwall is he pursued
gloucester ay my good lord
cornwall if he be taken he shall never more
