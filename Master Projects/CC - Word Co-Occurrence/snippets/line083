till a dart strike through his liver as a bird hasteth to the snare and knoweth not that it is for his life
hearken unto me now therefore o ye children and attend to the words of my mouth
let not thine heart decline to her ways go not astray in her paths
for she hath cast down many wounded yea many strong men have been slain by her
her house is the way to hell going down to the chambers of death
doth not wisdom cry and understanding put forth her voice
she standeth in the top of high places by the way in the places of the paths
she crieth at the gates at the entry of the city at the coming in at the doors
unto you o men i call and my voice is to the sons of man
o ye simple understand wisdom and ye fools be ye of an understanding heart
hear for i will speak of excellent things and the opening of my lips shall be right things
for my mouth shall speak truth and wickedness is an abomination to my lips
all the words of my mouth are in righteousness there is nothing froward or perverse in them
they are all plain to him that understandeth and right to them that find knowledge
receive my instruction and not silver and knowledge rather than choice gold
for wisdom is better than rubies and all the things that may be desired are not to be compared to it
i wisdom dwell with prudence and find out knowledge of witty inventions
the fear of the lord is to hate evil pride and arrogancy and the evil way and the froward mouth do i hate
counsel is mine and sound wisdom i am understanding i have strength
by me kings reign and princes decree justice
by me princes rule and nobles even all the judges of the earth
i love them that love me and those that seek me early shall find me
riches and honour are with me yea durable riches and righteousness
my fruit is better than gold yea than fine gold and my revenue than choice silver
i lead in the way of righteousness in the midst of the paths of judgment
that i may cause those that love me to inherit substance and i will fill their treasures
the lord possessed me in the beginning of his way before his works of old
i was set up from everlasting from the beginning or ever the earth was
when there were no depths i was brought forth when there were no fountains abounding with water
before the mountains were settled before the hills was i brought forth
while as yet he had not made the earth nor the fields nor the highest part of the dust of the world
when he prepared the heavens i was there when he set a compass upon the face of the depth
when he established the clouds above when he strengthened the fountains of the deep
when he gave to the sea his decree that the waters should not pass his commandment when he appointed the foundations of the earth
then i was by him as one brought up with him and i was daily his delight rejoicing always before him
rejoicing in the habitable part of his earth and my delights were with the sons of men
now therefore hearken unto me o ye children for blessed are they that keep my ways
hear instruction and be wise and refuse it not
blessed is the man that heareth me watching daily at my gates waiting at the posts of my doors
for whoso findeth me findeth life and shall obtain favour of the lord
but he that sinneth against me wrongeth his own soul all they that hate me love death
wisdom hath builded her house she hath hewn out her seven pillars
she hath killed her beasts she hath mingled her wine she hath also furnished her table
she hath sent forth her maidens she crieth upon the highest places of the city
whoso is simple let him turn in hither as for him that wanteth understanding she saith to him
come eat of my bread and drink of the wine which i have mingled
forsake the foolish and live and go in the way of understanding
he that reproveth a scorner getteth to himself shame and he that rebuketh a wicked man getteth himself a blot
reprove not a scorner lest he hate thee rebuke a wise man and he will love thee
give instruction to a wise man and he will be yet wiser teach a just man and he will increase in learning
the fear of the lord is the beginning of wisdom and the knowledge of the holy is understanding
for by me thy days shall be multiplied and the years of thy life shall be increased
if thou be wise thou shalt be wise for thyself but if thou scornest thou alone shalt bear it
a foolish woman is clamorous she is simple and knoweth nothing
for she sitteth at the door of her house on a seat in the high places of the city
to call passengers who go right on their ways
whoso is simple let him turn in hither and as for him that wanteth understanding she saith to him
stolen waters are sweet and bread eaten in secret is pleasant
but he knoweth not that the dead are there and that her guests are in the depths of hell
the proverbs of solomon a wise son maketh a glad father but a foolish son is the heaviness of his mother
treasures of wickedness profit nothing but righteousness delivereth from death
the lord will not suffer the soul of the righteous to famish but he casteth away the substance of the wicked
he becometh poor that dealeth with a slack hand but the hand of the diligent maketh rich

the mouth of a righteous man is a well of life but violence covereth the mouth of the wicked
hatred stirreth up strifes but love covereth all sins
in the lips of him that hath understanding wisdom is found but a rod is for the back of him that is void of understanding

the rich man's wealth is his strong city the destruction of the poor is their poverty
the labour of the righteous tendeth to life the fruit of the wicked to sin
he is in the way of life that keepeth instruction but he that refuseth reproof erreth
he that hideth hatred with lying lips and he that uttereth a slander is a fool
