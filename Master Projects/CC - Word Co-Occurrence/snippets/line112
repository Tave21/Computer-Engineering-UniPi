can two walk together except they be agreed
will a lion roar in the forest when he hath no prey will a young lion cry out of his den if he have taken nothing
can a bird fall in a snare upon the earth where no gin is for him shall one take up a snare from the earth and have taken nothing at all
shall a trumpet be blown in the city and the people not be afraid shall there be evil in a city and the lord hath not done it
surely the lord god will do nothing but he revealeth his secret unto his servants the prophets
the lion hath roared who will not fear the lord god hath spoken who can but prophesy
publish in the palaces at ashdod and in the palaces in the land of egypt and say assemble yourselves upon the mountains of samaria and behold the great tumults in the midst thereof and the oppressed in the midst thereof
for they know not to do right saith the lord who store up violence and robbery in their palaces
therefore thus saith the lord god an adversary there shall be even round about the land and he shall bring down thy strength from thee and thy palaces shall be spoiled
thus saith the lord as the shepherd taketh out of the mouth of the lion two legs or a piece of an ear so shall the children of israel be taken out that dwell in samaria in the corner of a bed and in damascus in a couch
hear ye and testify in the house of jacob saith the lord god the god of hosts
that in the day that i shall visit the transgressions of israel upon him i will also visit the altars of bethel and the horns of the altar shall be cut off and fall to the ground
and i will smite the winter house with the summer house and the houses of ivory shall perish and the great houses shall have an end saith the lord
hear this word ye kine of bashan that are in the mountain of samaria which oppress the poor which crush the needy which say to their masters bring and let us drink
the lord god hath sworn by his holiness that lo the days shall come upon you that he will take you away with hooks and your posterity with fishhooks
and ye shall go out at the breaches every cow at that which is before her and ye shall cast them into the palace saith the lord
come to bethel and transgress at gilgal multiply transgression and bring your sacrifices every morning and your tithes after three years
and offer a sacrifice of thanksgiving with leaven and proclaim and publish the free offerings for this liketh you o ye children of israel saith the lord god
and i also have given you cleanness of teeth in all your cities and want of bread in all your places yet have ye not returned unto me saith the lord
and also i have withholden the rain from you when there were yet three months to the harvest and i caused it to rain upon one city and caused it not to rain upon another city one piece was rained upon and the piece whereupon it rained not withered
so two or three cities wandered unto one city to drink water but they were not satisfied yet have ye not returned unto me saith the lord
i have smitten you with blasting and mildew when your gardens and your vineyards and your fig trees and your olive trees increased the palmerworm devoured them yet have ye not returned unto me saith the lord
i have sent among you the pestilence after the manner of egypt your young men have i slain with the sword and have taken away your horses and i have made the stink of your camps to come up unto your nostrils yet have ye not returned unto me saith the lord
i have overthrown some of you as god overthrew sodom and gomorrah and ye were as a firebrand plucked out of the burning yet have ye not returned unto me saith the lord
therefore thus will i do unto thee o israel and because i will do this unto thee prepare to meet thy god o israel
for lo he that formeth the mountains and createth the wind and declareth unto man what is his thought that maketh the morning darkness and treadeth upon the high places of the earth the lord the god of hosts is his name
hear ye this word which i take up against you even a lamentation o house of israel
the virgin of israel is fallen she shall no more rise she is forsaken upon her land there is none to raise her up
for thus saith the lord god the city that went out by a thousand shall leave an hundred and that which went forth by an hundred shall leave ten to the house of israel
for thus saith the lord unto the house of israel seek ye me and ye shall live
but seek not bethel nor enter into gilgal and pass not to beersheba for gilgal shall surely go into captivity and bethel shall come to nought
seek the lord and ye shall live lest he break out like fire in the house of joseph and devour it and there be none to quench it in bethel
ye who turn judgment to wormwood and leave off righteousness in the earth
seek him that maketh the seven stars and orion and turneth the shadow of death into the morning and maketh the day dark with night that calleth for the waters of the sea and poureth them out upon the face of the earth the lord is his name
that strengtheneth the spoiled against the strong so that the spoiled shall come against the fortress
they hate him that rebuketh in the gate and they abhor him that speaketh uprightly
forasmuch therefore as your treading is upon the poor and ye take from him burdens of wheat ye have built houses of hewn stone but ye shall not dwell in them ye have planted pleasant vineyards but ye shall not drink wine of them
for i know your manifold transgressions and your mighty sins they afflict the just they take a bribe and they turn aside the poor in the gate from their right
therefore the prudent shall keep silence in that time for it is an evil time
seek good and not evil that ye may live and so the lord the god of hosts shall be with you as ye have spoken
hate the evil and love the good and establish judgment in the gate it may be that the lord god of hosts will be gracious unto the remnant of joseph
therefore the lord the god of hosts the lord saith thus wailing shall be in all streets and they shall say in all the highways alas alas and they shall call the husbandman to mourning and such as are skilful of lamentation to wailing
and in all vineyards shall be wailing for i will pass through thee saith the lord
woe unto you that desire the day of the lord to what end is it for you the day of the lord is darkness and not light
as if a man did flee from a lion and a bear met him or went into the house and leaned his hand on the wall and a serpent bit him
shall not the day of the lord be darkness and not light even very dark and no brightness in it
i hate i despise your feast days and i will not smell in your solemn assemblies
though ye offer me burnt offerings and your meat offerings i will not accept them neither will i regard the peace offerings of your fat beasts
take thou away from me the noise of thy songs for i will not hear the melody of thy viols
but let judgment run down as waters and righteousness as a mighty stream
have ye offered unto me sacrifices and offerings in the wilderness forty years o house of israel
but ye have borne the tabernacle of your moloch and chiun your images the star of your god which ye made to yourselves
therefore will i cause you to go into captivity beyond damascus saith the lord whose name is the god of hosts
woe to them that are at ease in zion and trust in the mountain of samaria which are named chief of the nations to whom the house of israel came
pass ye unto calneh and see and from thence go ye to hamath the great then go down to gath of the philistines be they better than these kingdoms or their border greater than your border
ye that put far away the evil day and cause the seat of violence to come near
that lie upon beds of ivory and stretch themselves upon their couches and eat the lambs out of the flock and the calves out of the midst of the stall
that chant to the sound of the viol and invent to themselves instruments of musick like david
that drink wine in bowls and anoint themselves with the chief ointments but they are not grieved for the affliction of joseph
therefore now shall they go captive with the first that go captive and the banquet of them that stretched themselves shall be removed
the lord god hath sworn by himself saith the lord the god of hosts i abhor the excellency of jacob and hate his palaces therefore will i deliver up the city with all that is therein
and it shall come to pass if there remain ten men in one house that they shall die
and a man's uncle shall take him up and he that burneth him to bring out the bones out of the house and shall say unto him that is by the sides of the house is there yet any with thee and he shall say no then shall he say hold thy tongue for we may not make mention of the name of the lord
for behold the lord commandeth and he will smite the great house with breaches and the little house with clefts
shall horses run upon the rock will one plow there with oxen for ye have turned judgment into gall and the fruit of righteousness into hemlock
ye which rejoice in a thing of nought which say have we not taken to us horns by our own strength
but behold i will raise up against you a nation o house of israel saith the lord the god of hosts and they shall afflict you from the entering in of hemath unto the river of the wilderness
thus hath the lord god shewed unto me and behold he formed grasshoppers in the beginning of the shooting up of the latter growth and lo it was the latter growth after the king's mowings
and it came to pass that when they had made an end of eating the grass of the land then i said o lord god forgive i beseech thee by whom shall jacob arise for he is small
the lord repented for this it shall not be saith the lord
thus hath the lord god shewed unto me and behold the lord god called to contend by fire and it devoured the great deep and did eat up a part
then said i o lord god cease i beseech thee by whom shall jacob arise for he is small
the lord repented for this this also shall not be saith the lord god
thus he shewed me and behold the lord stood upon a wall made by a plumbline with a plumbline in his hand
and the lord said unto me amos what seest thou and i said a plumbline then said the lord behold i will set a plumbline in the midst of my people israel i will not again pass by them any more
and the high places of isaac shall be desolate and the sanctuaries of israel shall be laid waste and i will rise against the house of jeroboam with the sword
then amaziah the priest of bethel sent to jeroboam king of israel saying amos hath conspired against thee in the midst of the house of israel the land is not able to bear all his words
for thus amos saith jeroboam shall die by the sword and israel shall surely be led away captive out of their own land
also amaziah said unto amos o thou seer go flee thee away into the land of judah and there eat bread and prophesy there
but prophesy not again any more at bethel for it is the king's chapel and it is the king's court
then answered amos and said to amaziah i was no prophet neither was i a prophet's son but i was an herdman and a gatherer of sycomore fruit
and the lord took me as i followed the flock and the lord said unto me go prophesy unto my people israel
now therefore hear thou the word of the lord thou sayest prophesy not against israel and drop not thy word against the house of isaac
therefore thus saith the lord thy wife shall be an harlot in the city and thy sons and thy daughters shall fall by the sword and thy land shall be divided by line and thou shalt die in a polluted land and israel shall surely go into captivity forth of his land
thus hath the lord god shewed unto me and behold a basket of summer fruit
and he said amos what seest thou and i said a basket of summer fruit then said the lord unto me the end is come upon my people of israel i will not again pass by them any more
and the songs of the temple shall be howlings in that day saith the lord god there shall be many dead bodies in every place they shall cast them forth with silence
hear this o ye that swallow up the needy even to make the poor of the land to fail
saying when will the new moon be gone that we may sell corn and the sabbath that we may set forth wheat making the ephah small and the shekel great and falsifying the balances by deceit
that we may buy the poor for silver and the needy for a pair of shoes yea and sell the refuse of the wheat
the lord hath sworn by the excellency of jacob surely i will never forget any of their works
shall not the land tremble for this and every one mourn that dwelleth therein and it shall rise up wholly as a flood and it shall be cast out and drowned as by the flood of egypt
and it shall come to pass in that day saith the lord god that i will cause the sun to go down at noon and i will darken the earth in the clear day
and i will turn your feasts into mourning and all your songs into lamentation and i will bring up sackcloth upon all loins and baldness upon every head and i will make it as the mourning of an only son and the end thereof as a bitter day
behold the days come saith the lord god that i will send a famine in the land not a famine of bread nor a thirst for water but of hearing the words of the lord
and they shall wander from sea to sea and from the north even to the east they shall run to and fro to seek the word of the lord and shall not find it
in that day shall the fair virgins and young men faint for thirst
they that swear by the sin of samaria and say thy god o dan liveth and the manner of beersheba liveth even they shall fall and never rise up again
i saw the lord standing upon the altar and he said smite the lintel of the door that the posts may shake and cut them in the head all of them and i will slay the last of them with the sword he that fleeth of them shall not flee away and he that escapeth of them shall not be delivered
though they dig into hell thence shall mine hand take them though they climb up to heaven thence will i bring them down
and though they hide themselves in the top of carmel i will search and take them out thence and though they be hid from my sight in the bottom of the sea thence will i command the serpent and he shall bite them
and though they go into captivity before their enemies thence will i command the sword and it shall slay them and i will set mine eyes upon them for evil and not for good
and the lord god of hosts is he that toucheth the land and it shall melt and all that dwell therein shall mourn and it shall rise up wholly like a flood and shall be drowned as by the flood of egypt
it is he that buildeth his stories in the heaven and hath founded his troop in the earth he that calleth for the waters of the sea and poureth them out upon the face of the earth the lord is his name
are ye not as children of the ethiopians unto me o children of israel saith the lord have not i brought up israel out of the land of egypt and the philistines from caphtor and the syrians from kir
behold the eyes of the lord god are upon the sinful kingdom and i will destroy it from off the face of the earth saving that i will not utterly destroy the house of jacob saith the lord
for lo i will command and i will sift the house of israel among all nations like as corn is sifted in a sieve yet shall not the least grain fall upon the earth
all the sinners of my people shall die by the sword which say the evil shall not overtake nor prevent us
in that day will i raise up the tabernacle of david that is fallen and close up the breaches thereof and i will raise up his ruins and i will build it as in the days of old
that they may possess the remnant of edom and of all the heathen which are called by my name saith the lord that doeth this
behold the days come saith the lord that the plowman shall overtake the reaper and the treader of grapes him that soweth seed and the mountains shall drop sweet wine and all the hills shall melt
and i will bring again the captivity of my people of israel and they shall build the waste cities and inhabit them and they shall plant vineyards and drink the wine thereof they shall also make gardens and eat the fruit of them
and i will plant them upon their land and they shall no more be pulled up out of their land which i have given them saith the lord thy god
the vision of obadiah thus saith the lord god concerning edom we have heard a rumour from the lord and an ambassador is sent among the heathen arise ye and let us rise up against her in battle
behold i have made thee small among the heathen thou art greatly despised
the pride of thine heart hath deceived thee thou that dwellest in the clefts of the rock whose habitation is high that saith in his heart who shall bring me down to the ground
though thou exalt thyself as the eagle and though thou set thy nest among the stars thence will i bring thee down saith the lord
if thieves came to thee if robbers by night how art thou cut off would they not have stolen till they had enough if the grapegatherers came to thee would they not leave some grapes
how are the things of esau searched out how are his hidden things sought up
all the men of thy confederacy have brought thee even to the border the men that were at peace with thee have deceived thee and prevailed against thee they that eat thy bread have laid a wound under thee there is none understanding in him
shall i not in that day saith the lord even destroy the wise men out of edom and understanding out of the mount of esau
and thy mighty men o teman shall be dismayed to the end that every one of the mount of esau may be cut off by slaughter
for thy violence against thy brother jacob shame shall cover thee and thou shalt be cut off for ever
in the day that thou stoodest on the other side in the day that the strangers carried away captive his forces and foreigners entered into his gates and cast lots upon jerusalem even thou wast as one of them
but thou shouldest not have looked on the day of thy brother in the day that he became a stranger neither shouldest thou have rejoiced over the children of judah in the day of their destruction neither shouldest thou have spoken proudly in the day of distress
thou shouldest not have entered into the gate of my people in the day of their calamity yea thou shouldest not have looked on their affliction in the day of their calamity nor have laid hands on their substance in the day of their calamity
neither shouldest thou have stood in the crossway to cut off those of his that did escape neither shouldest thou have delivered up those of his that did remain in the day of distress
for the day of the lord is near upon all the heathen as thou hast done it shall be done unto thee thy reward shall return upon thine own head
for as ye have drunk upon my holy mountain so shall all the heathen drink continually yea they shall drink and they shall swallow down and they shall be as though they had not been
but upon mount zion shall be deliverance and there shall be holiness and the house of jacob shall possess their possessions
and the house of jacob shall be a fire and the house of joseph a flame and the house of esau for stubble and they shall kindle in them and devour them and there shall not be any remaining of the house of esau for the lord hath spoken it
and they of the south shall possess the mount of esau and they of the plain the philistines and they shall possess the fields of ephraim and the fields of samaria and benjamin shall possess gilead
and the captivity of this host of the children of israel shall possess that of the canaanites even unto zarephath and the captivity of jerusalem which is in sepharad shall possess the cities of the south
and saviours shall come up on mount zion to judge the mount of esau and the kingdom shall be the lord's
now the word of the lord came unto jonah the son of amittai saying
arise go to nineveh that great city and cry against it for their wickedness is come up before me
but jonah rose up to flee unto tarshish from the presence of the lord and went down to joppa and he found a ship going to tarshish so he paid the fare thereof and went down into it to go with them unto tarshish from the presence of the lord
but the lord sent out a great wind into the sea and there was a mighty tempest in the sea so that the ship was like to be broken
then the mariners were afraid and cried every man unto his god and cast forth the wares that were in the ship into the sea to lighten it of them but jonah was gone down into the sides of the ship and he lay and was fast asleep
so the shipmaster came to him and said unto him what meanest thou o sleeper arise call upon thy god if so be that god will think upon us that we perish not
and they said every one to his fellow come and let us cast lots that we may know for whose cause this evil is upon us so they cast lots and the lot fell upon jonah
then said they unto him tell us we pray thee for whose cause this evil is upon us what is thine occupation and whence comest thou what is thy country and of what people art thou
and he said unto them i am an hebrew and i fear the lord the god of heaven which hath made the sea and the dry land
then were the men exceedingly afraid and said unto him why hast thou done this for the men knew that he fled from the presence of the lord because he had told them
then said they unto him what shall we do unto thee that the sea may be calm unto us for the sea wrought and was tempestuous
and he said unto them take me up and cast me forth into the sea so shall the sea be calm unto you for i know that for my sake this great tempest is upon you
nevertheless the men rowed hard to bring it to the land but they could not for the sea wrought and was tempestuous against them
wherefore they cried unto the lord and said we beseech thee o lord we beseech thee let us not perish for this man's life and lay not upon us innocent blood for thou o lord hast done as it pleased thee
so they took up jonah and cast him forth into the sea and the sea ceased from her raging
then the men feared the lord exceedingly and offered a sacrifice unto the lord and made vows
now the lord had prepared a great fish to swallow up jonah and jonah was in the belly of the fish three days and three nights
then jonah prayed unto the lord his god out of the fish's belly
and said i cried by reason of mine affliction unto the lord and he heard me out of the belly of hell cried i and thou heardest my voice
for thou hadst cast me into the deep in the midst of the seas and the floods compassed me about all thy billows and thy waves passed over me
then i said i am cast out of thy sight yet i will look again toward thy holy temple
the waters compassed me about even to the soul the depth closed me round about the weeds were wrapped about my head
i went down to the bottoms of the mountains the earth with her bars was about me for ever yet hast thou brought up my life from corruption o lord my god
when my soul fainted within me i remembered the lord and my prayer came in unto thee into thine holy temple
they that observe lying vanities forsake their own mercy
but i will sacrifice unto thee with the voice of thanksgiving i will pay that that i have vowed salvation is of the lord
and the lord spake unto the fish and it vomited out jonah upon the dry land
and the word of the lord came unto jonah the second time saying
arise go unto nineveh that great city and preach unto it the preaching that i bid thee
so jonah arose and went unto nineveh according to the word of the lord now nineveh was an exceeding great city of three days journey
and jonah began to enter into the city a day's journey and he cried and said yet forty days and nineveh shall be overthrown
so the people of nineveh believed god and proclaimed a fast and put on sackcloth from the greatest of them even to the least of them
for word came unto the king of nineveh and he arose from his throne and he laid his robe from him and covered him with sackcloth and sat in ashes
and he caused it to be proclaimed and published through nineveh by the decree of the king and his nobles saying let neither man nor beast herd nor flock taste any thing let them not feed nor drink water
but let man and beast be covered with sackcloth and cry mightily unto god yea let them turn every one from his evil way and from the violence that is in their hands
who can tell if god will turn and repent and turn away from his fierce anger that we perish not
and god saw their works that they turned from their evil way and god repented of the evil that he had said that he would do unto them and he did it not
but it displeased jonah exceedingly and he was very angry
and he prayed unto the lord and said i pray thee o lord was not this my saying when i was yet in my country therefore i fled before unto tarshish for i knew that thou art a gracious god and merciful slow to anger and of great kindness and repentest thee of the evil
therefore now o lord take i beseech thee my life from me for it is better for me to die than to live
then said the lord doest thou well to be angry
so jonah went out of the city and sat on the east side of the city and there made him a booth and sat under it in the shadow till he might see what would become of the city
and the lord god prepared a gourd and made it to come up over jonah that it might be a shadow over his head to deliver him from his grief so jonah was exceeding glad of the gourd
but god prepared a worm when the morning rose the next day and it smote the gourd that it withered
and it came to pass when the sun did arise that god prepared a vehement east wind and the sun beat upon the head of jonah that he fainted and wished in himself to die and said it is better for me to die than to live
and god said to jonah doest thou well to be angry for the gourd and he said i do well to be angry even unto death
then said the lord thou hast had pity on the gourd for the which thou hast not laboured neither madest it grow which came up in a night and perished in a night
and should not i spare nineveh that great city wherein are more than sixscore thousand persons that cannot discern between their right hand and their left hand and also much cattle
the word of the lord that came to micah the morasthite in the days of jotham ahaz and hezekiah kings of judah which he saw concerning samaria and jerusalem
hear all ye people hearken o earth and all that therein is and let the lord god be witness against you the lord from his holy temple
for behold the lord cometh forth out of his place and will come down and tread upon the high places of the earth
and the mountains shall be molten under him and the valleys shall be cleft as wax before the fire and as the waters that are poured down a steep place
for the transgression of jacob is all this and for the sins of the house of israel what is the transgression of jacob is it not samaria and what are the high places of judah are they not jerusalem
therefore i will make samaria as an heap of the field and as plantings of a vineyard and i will pour down the stones thereof into the valley and i will discover the foundations thereof
and all the graven images thereof shall be beaten to pieces and all the hires thereof shall be burned with the fire and all the idols thereof will i lay desolate for she gathered it of the hire of an harlot and they shall return to the hire of an harlot
therefore i will wail and howl i will go stripped and naked i will make a wailing like the dragons and mourning as the owls
for her wound is incurable for it is come unto judah he is come unto the gate of my people even to jerusalem
declare ye it not at gath weep ye not at all in the house of aphrah roll thyself in the dust
pass ye away thou inhabitant of saphir having thy shame naked the inhabitant of zaanan came not forth in the mourning of bethezel he shall receive of you his standing
for the inhabitant of maroth waited carefully for good but evil came down from the lord unto the gate of jerusalem
o thou inhabitant of lachish bind the chariot to the swift beast she is the beginning of the sin to the daughter of zion for the transgressions of israel were found in thee
therefore shalt thou give presents to moreshethgath the houses of achzib shall be a lie to the kings of israel
yet will i bring an heir unto thee o inhabitant of mareshah he shall come unto adullam the glory of israel
make thee bald and poll thee for thy delicate children enlarge thy baldness as the eagle for they are gone into captivity from thee
woe to them that devise iniquity and work evil upon their beds when the morning is light they practise it because it is in the power of their hand
and they covet fields and take them by violence and houses and take them away so they oppress a man and his house even a man and his heritage
