 epilogue
 enter chorus
chorus thus far with rough and allunable pen
 our bending author hath pursued the story
 in little room confining mighty men
 mangling by starts the full course of their glory
 small time but in that small most greatly lived
 this star of england fortune made his sword
 by which the world's best garden be achieved
 and of it left his son imperial lord
 henry the sixth in infant bands crown'd king
 of france and england did this king succeed
 whose state so many had the managing
 that they lost france and made his england bleed
 which oft our stage hath shown and for their sake
 in your fair minds let this acceptance take

 the prologue
 i come no more to make you laugh things now
 that bear a weighty and a serious brow
 sad high and working full of state and woe
 such noble scenes as draw the eye to flow
 we now present those that can pity here
 may if they think it well let fall a tear
 the subject will deserve it such as give
 their money out of hope they may believe
 may here find truth too those that come to see
 only a show or two and so agree
 the play may pass if they be still and willing
 i'll undertake may see away their shilling
 richly in two short hours only they
 that come to hear a merry bawdy play
 a noise of targets or to see a fellow
 in a long motley coat guarded with yellow
 will be deceived for gentle hearers know
 to rank our chosen truth with such a show
 as fool and fight is beside forfeiting
 our own brains and the opinion that we bring
 to make that only true we now intend
 will leave us never an understanding friend
 therefore for goodness sake and as you are known
 the first and happiest hearers of the town
 be sad as we would make ye think ye see
 the very persons of our noble story
 as they were living think you see them great
 and follow'd with the general throng and sweat
 of thousand friends then in a moment see
 how soon this mightiness meets misery
 and if you can be merry then i'll say
 a man may weep upon his weddingday

act i
scene i london an antechamber in the palace
 enter norfolk at one door at the other buckingham
 and abergavenny
buckingham good morrow and well met how have ye done
 since last we saw in france
norfolk i thank your grace
 healthful and ever since a fresh admirer
 of what i saw there
buckingham an untimely ague
 stay'd me a prisoner in my chamber when
 those suns of glory those two lights of men
 met in the vale of andren
norfolk twixt guynes and arde
 i was then present saw them salute on horseback
 beheld them when they lighted how they clung
 in their embracement as they grew together
 which had they what four throned ones could have weigh'd
 such a compounded one
buckingham all the whole time
 i was my chamber's prisoner
norfolk then you lost
 the view of earthly glory men might say
 till this time pomp was single but now married
 to one above itself each following day
 became the next day's master till the last
 made former wonders its today the french
 all clinquant all in gold like heathen gods
 shone down the english and tomorrow they
 made britain india every man that stood
 show'd like a mine their dwarfish pages were
 as cherubins all guilt the madams too
 not used to toil did almost sweat to bear
 the pride upon them that their very labour
 was to them as a painting now this masque
 was cried incomparable and the ensuing night
 made it a fool and beggar the two kings
 equal in lustre were now best now worst
 as presence did present them him in eye
 still him in praise and being present both
 twas said they saw but one and no discerner
 durst wag his tongue in censure when these suns
 for so they phrase emby their heralds challenged
 the noble spirits to arms they did perform
 beyond thought's compass that former fabulous story
 being now seen possible enough got credit
 that bevis was believed
buckingham o you go far
norfolk as i belong to worship and affect
 in honour honesty the tract of every thing
 would by a good discourser lose some life
 which action's self was tongue to all was royal
 to the disposing of it nought rebell'd
 order gave each thing view the office did
 distinctly his full function
buckingham who did guide
 i mean who set the body and the limbs
 of this great sport together as you guess
norfolk one certes that promises no element
 in such a business
buckingham i pray you who my lord
norfolk all this was order'd by the good discretion
 of the right reverend cardinal of york
buckingham the devil speed him no man's pie is freed
 from his ambitious finger what had he
 to do in these fierce vanities i wonder
 that such a keech can with his very bulk
