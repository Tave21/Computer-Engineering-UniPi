 exeunt king claudius and polonius
 enter hamlet
hamlet to be or not to be that is the question
 whether tis nobler in the mind to suffer
 the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune
 or to take arms against a sea of troubles
 and by opposing end them to die to sleep
 no more and by a sleep to say we end
 the heartache and the thousand natural shocks
 that flesh is heir to tis a consummation
 devoutly to be wish'd to die to sleep
 to sleep perchance to dream ay there's the rub
 for in that sleep of death what dreams may come
 when we have shuffled off this mortal coil
 must give us pause there's the respect
 that makes calamity of so long life
 for who would bear the whips and scorns of time
 the oppressor's wrong the proud man's contumely
 the pangs of despised love the law's delay
 the insolence of office and the spurns
 that patient merit of the unworthy takes
 when he himself might his quietus make
 with a bare bodkin who would fardels bear
 to grunt and sweat under a weary life
 but that the dread of something after death
 the undiscover'd country from whose bourn
 no traveller returns puzzles the will
 and makes us rather bear those ills we have
 than fly to others that we know not of
 thus conscience does make cowards of us all
 and thus the native hue of resolution
 is sicklied o'er with the pale cast of thought
 and enterprises of great pith and moment
 with this regard their currents turn awry
 and lose the name of actionsoft you now
 the fair ophelia nymph in thy orisons
 be all my sins remember'd
ophelia good my lord
 how does your honour for this many a day
hamlet i humbly thank you well well well
ophelia my lord i have remembrances of yours
 that i have longed long to redeliver
 i pray you now receive them
hamlet no not i
 i never gave you aught
ophelia my honour'd lord you know right well you did
 and with them words of so sweet breath composed
 as made the things more rich their perfume lost
 take these again for to the noble mind
 rich gifts wax poor when givers prove unkind
 there my lord
hamlet ha ha are you honest
ophelia my lord
hamlet are you fair
ophelia what means your lordship
hamlet that if you be honest and fair your honesty should
 admit no discourse to your beauty
ophelia could beauty my lord have better commerce than
 with honesty
hamlet ay truly for the power of beauty will sooner
 transform honesty from what it is to a bawd than the
 force of honesty can translate beauty into his
 likeness this was sometime a paradox but now the
 time gives it proof i did love you once
ophelia indeed my lord you made me believe so
hamlet you should not have believed me for virtue cannot
 so inoculate our old stock but we shall relish of
 it i loved you not
ophelia i was the more deceived
hamlet get thee to a nunnery why wouldst thou be a
 breeder of sinners i am myself indifferent honest
 but yet i could accuse me of such things that it
 were better my mother had not borne me i am very
 proud revengeful ambitious with more offences at
 my beck than i have thoughts to put them in
 imagination to give them shape or time to act them
 in what should such fellows as i do crawling
 between earth and heaven we are arrant knaves
 all believe none of us go thy ways to a nunnery
 where's your father
ophelia at home my lord
hamlet let the doors be shut upon him that he may play the
 fool no where but in's own house farewell
ophelia o help him you sweet heavens
hamlet if thou dost marry i'll give thee this plague for
 thy dowry be thou as chaste as ice as pure as
 snow thou shalt not escape calumny get thee to a
 nunnery go farewell or if thou wilt needs
 marry marry a fool for wise men know well enough
 what monsters you make of them to a nunnery go
 and quickly too farewell
ophelia o heavenly powers restore him
hamlet i have heard of your paintings too well enough god
 has given you one face and you make yourselves
 another you jig you amble and you lisp and
 nickname god's creatures and make your wantonness
 your ignorance go to i'll no more on't it hath
 made me mad i say we will have no more marriages
 those that are married already all but one shall
 live the rest shall keep as they are to a
 nunnery go
 exit
ophelia o what a noble mind is here o'erthrown
 the courtier's soldier's scholar's eye tongue sword
 the expectancy and rose of the fair state
 the glass of fashion and the mould of form
 the observed of all observers quite quite down
 and i of ladies most deject and wretched
 that suck'd the honey of his music vows
 now see that noble and most sovereign reason
 like sweet bells jangled out of tune and harsh
 that unmatch'd form and feature of blown youth
 blasted with ecstasy o woe is me
 to have seen what i have seen see what i see
 reenter king claudius and polonius
king claudius love his affections do not that way tend
 nor what he spake though it lack'd form a little
 was not like madness there's something in his soul
 o'er which his melancholy sits on brood
 and i do doubt the hatch and the disclose
 will be some danger which for to prevent
 i have in quick determination
 thus set it down he shall with speed to england
 for the demand of our neglected tribute
 haply the seas and countries different
 with variable objects shall expel
 this somethingsettled matter in his heart
 whereon his brains still beating puts him thus
 from fashion of himself what think you on't
lord polonius it shall do well but yet do i believe
 the origin and commencement of his grief
 sprung from neglected love how now ophelia
 you need not tell us what lord hamlet said
 we heard it all my lord do as you please
 but if you hold it fit after the play
 let his queen mother all alone entreat him
 to show his grief let her be round with him
 and i'll be placed so please you in the ear
 of all their conference if she find him not
 to england send him or confine him where
 your wisdom best shall think
king claudius it shall be so
 madness in great ones must not unwatch'd go

act iii
scene ii a hall in the castle
 enter hamlet and players
hamlet speak the speech i pray you as i pronounced it to
 you trippingly on the tongue but if you mouth it
 as many of your players do i had as lief the
 towncrier spoke my lines nor do not saw the air
 too much with your hand thus but use all gently
 for in the very torrent tempest and as i may say
 the whirlwind of passion you must acquire and beget
 a temperance that may give it smoothness o it
 offends me to the soul to hear a robustious
 periwigpated fellow tear a passion to tatters to
 very rags to split the ears of the groundlings who
 for the most part are capable of nothing but
 inexplicable dumbshows and noise i would have such
 a fellow whipped for o'erdoing termagant it
 outherods herod pray you avoid it
first player i warrant your honour
hamlet be not too tame neither but let your own discretion
 be your tutor suit the action to the word the
 word to the action with this special o'erstep not
 the modesty of nature for any thing so overdone is
 from the purpose of playing whose end both at the
 first and now was and is to hold as twere the
 mirror up to nature to show virtue her own feature
 scorn her own image and the very age and body of
 the time his form and pressure now this overdone
 or come tardy off though it make the unskilful
 laugh cannot but make the judicious grieve the
 censure of the which one must in your allowance
 o'erweigh a whole theatre of others o there be
 players that i have seen play and heard others
 praise and that highly not to speak it profanely
 that neither having the accent of christians nor
 the gait of christian pagan nor man have so
 strutted and bellowed that i have thought some of
 nature's journeymen had made men and not made them
 well they imitated humanity so abominably
first player i hope we have reformed that indifferently with us
 sir
hamlet o reform it altogether and let those that play
 your clowns speak no more than is set down for them
 for there be of them that will themselves laugh to
 set on some quantity of barren spectators to laugh
 too though in the mean time some necessary
 question of the play be then to be considered
 that's villanous and shows a most pitiful ambition
 in the fool that uses it go make you ready
 exeunt players
 enter polonius rosencrantz and guildenstern
 how now my lord i will the king hear this piece of work
lord polonius and the queen too and that presently
hamlet bid the players make haste
 exit polonius
