 of gold and jewels that i bobb'd from him
 as gifts to desdemona

 othello
act v
scene ii a bedchamber in the castle desdemona in bed asleep
 a light burning
 enter othello
othello it is the cause it is the cause my soul
 let me not name it to you you chaste stars
 it is the cause yet i'll not shed her blood
 nor scar that whiter skin of hers than snow
 and smooth as monumental alabaster
 yet she must die else she'll betray more men
 put out the light and then put out the light
 if i quench thee thou flaming minister
 i can again thy former light restore
 should i repent me but once put out thy light
 thou cunning'st pattern of excelling nature
 i know not where is that promethean heat
 that can thy light relume when i have pluck'd the rose
 i cannot give it vital growth again
 it must needs wither i'll smell it on the tree
 kissing her
 ah balmy breath that dost almost persuade
 justice to break her sword one more one more
 be thus when thou art dead and i will kill thee
 and love thee after one more and this the last
 so sweet was ne'er so fatal i must weep
 but they are cruel tears this sorrow's heavenly
 it strikes where it doth love she wakes
desdemona who's there othello
othello ay desdemona
desdemona will you come to bed my lord
othello have you pray'd tonight desdemona
desdemona ay my lord
othello if you bethink yourself of any crime
 unreconciled as yet to heaven and grace
 solicit for it straight
desdemona alas my lord what do you mean by that
othello well do it and be brief i will walk by
 i would not kill thy unprepared spirit
 no heaven forfend i would not kill thy soul
desdemona talk you of killing
othello ay i do
desdemona then heaven
 have mercy on me
