duke vincentio bring me to hear them speak where i may be concealed
 exeunt duke vincentio and provost
claudio now sister what's the comfort
isabella why
 as all comforts are most good most good indeed
 lord angelo having affairs to heaven
 intends you for his swift ambassador
 where you shall be an everlasting leiger
 therefore your best appointment make with speed
 tomorrow you set on
claudio is there no remedy
isabella none but such remedy as to save a head
 to cleave a heart in twain
claudio but is there any
isabella yes brother you may live
 there is a devilish mercy in the judge
 if you'll implore it that will free your life
 but fetter you till death
claudio perpetual durance
isabella ay just perpetual durance a restraint
 though all the world's vastidity you had
 to a determined scope
claudio but in what nature
isabella in such a one as you consenting to't
 would bark your honour from that trunk you bear
 and leave you naked
claudio let me know the point
isabella o i do fear thee claudio and i quake
 lest thou a feverous life shouldst entertain
 and six or seven winters more respect
 than a perpetual honour darest thou die
 the sense of death is most in apprehension
 and the poor beetle that we tread upon
 in corporal sufferance finds a pang as great
 as when a giant dies
claudio why give you me this shame
 think you i can a resolution fetch
 from flowery tenderness if i must die
 i will encounter darkness as a bride
 and hug it in mine arms
isabella there spake my brother there my father's grave
 did utter forth a voice yes thou must die
 thou art too noble to conserve a life
 in base appliances this outwardsainted deputy
 whose settled visage and deliberate word
 nips youth i the head and follies doth emmew
 as falcon doth the fowl is yet a devil
 his filth within being cast he would appear
 a pond as deep as hell
claudio the prenzie angelo
isabella o tis the cunning livery of hell
 the damned'st body to invest and cover
 in prenzie guards dost thou think claudio
 if i would yield him my virginity
 thou mightst be freed
claudio o heavens it cannot be
isabella yes he would give't thee from this rank offence
 so to offend him still this night's the time
 that i should do what i abhor to name
 or else thou diest tomorrow
claudio thou shalt not do't
isabella o were it but my life
 i'ld throw it down for your deliverance
 as frankly as a pin
claudio thanks dear isabel
isabella be ready claudio for your death tomorrow
claudio yes has he affections in him
 that thus can make him bite the law by the nose
 when he would force it sure it is no sin
 or of the deadly seven it is the least
isabella which is the least
claudio if it were damnable he being so wise
 why would he for the momentary trick
 be perdurably fined o isabel
isabella what says my brother
claudio death is a fearful thing
isabella and shamed life a hateful
claudio ay but to die and go we know not where
 to lie in cold obstruction and to rot
 this sensible warm motion to become
 a kneaded clod and the delighted spirit
 to bathe in fiery floods or to reside
 in thrilling region of thickribbed ice
 to be imprison'd in the viewless winds
 and blown with restless violence round about
 the pendent world or to be worse than worst
 of those that lawless and incertain thought
 imagine howling tis too horrible
 the weariest and most loathed worldly life
 that age ache penury and imprisonment
 can lay on nature is a paradise
 to what we fear of death
isabella alas alas
claudio sweet sister let me live
 what sin you do to save a brother's life
 nature dispenses with the deed so far
 that it becomes a virtue
isabella o you beast
 o faithless coward o dishonest wretch
 wilt thou be made a man out of my vice
 is't not a kind of incest to take life
 from thine own sister's shame what should i think
 heaven shield my mother play'd my father fair
 for such a warped slip of wilderness
 ne'er issued from his blood take my defiance
 die perish might but my bending down
 reprieve thee from thy fate it should proceed
 i'll pray a thousand prayers for thy death
 no word to save thee
claudio nay hear me isabel
isabella o fie fie fie
 thy sin's not accidental but a trade
 mercy to thee would prove itself a bawd
 tis best thou diest quickly
claudio o hear me isabella
 reenter duke vincentio
duke vincentio vouchsafe a word young sister but one word
isabella what is your will
duke vincentio might you dispense with your leisure i would by and
 by have some speech with you the satisfaction i
 would require is likewise your own benefit
isabella i have no superfluous leisure my stay must be
 stolen out of other affairs but i will attend you awhile
 walks apart
duke vincentio son i have overheard what hath passed between you
 and your sister angelo had never the purpose to
 corrupt her only he hath made an essay of her
 virtue to practise his judgment with the disposition
 of natures she having the truth of honour in her
 hath made him that gracious denial which he is most
 glad to receive i am confessor to angelo and i
 know this to be true therefore prepare yourself to
 death do not satisfy your resolution with hopes
 that are fallible tomorrow you must die go to
 your knees and make ready
claudio let me ask my sister pardon i am so out of love
 with life that i will sue to be rid of it
duke vincentio hold you there farewell
 exit claudio
 provost a word with you
 reenter provost
provost what's your will father
duke vincentio that now you are come you will be gone leave me
 awhile with the maid my mind promises with my
 habit no loss shall touch her by my company
provost in good time
 exit provost isabella comes forward
duke vincentio the hand that hath made you fair hath made you good
 the goodness that is cheap in beauty makes beauty
 brief in goodness but grace being the soul of
 your complexion shall keep the body of it ever
 fair the assault that angelo hath made to you
 fortune hath conveyed to my understanding and but
 that frailty hath examples for his falling i should
 wonder at angelo how will you do to content this
 substitute and to save your brother
isabella i am now going to resolve him i had rather my
 brother die by the law than my son should be
 unlawfully born but o how much is the good duke
 deceived in angelo if ever he return and i can
 speak to him i will open my lips in vain or
 discover his government
duke vincentio that shall not be much amiss yet as the matter
 now stands he will avoid your accusation he made
 trial of you only therefore fasten your ear on my
 advisings to the love i have in doing good a
 remedy presents itself i do make myself believe
 that you may most uprighteously do a poor wronged
 lady a merited benefit redeem your brother from
 the angry law do no stain to your own gracious
 person and much please the absent duke if
 peradventure he shall ever return to have hearing of
 this business
isabella let me hear you speak farther i have spirit to do
 anything that appears not foul in the truth of my spirit
duke vincentio virtue is bold and goodness never fearful have
 you not heard speak of mariana the sister of
 frederick the great soldier who miscarried at sea
isabella i have heard of the lady and good words went with her name
duke vincentio she should this angelo have married was affianced
 to her by oath and the nuptial appointed between
 which time of the contract and limit of the
 solemnity her brother frederick was wrecked at sea
 having in that perished vessel the dowry of his
 sister but mark how heavily this befell to the
 poor gentlewoman there she lost a noble and
 renowned brother in his love toward her ever most
 kind and natural with him the portion and sinew of
 her fortune her marriagedowry with both her
 combinate husband this wellseeming angelo
isabella can this be so did angelo so leave her
duke vincentio left her in her tears and dried not one of them
 with his comfort swallowed his vows whole
 pretending in her discoveries of dishonour in few
 bestowed her on her own lamentation which she yet
 wears for his sake and he a marble to her tears
 is washed with them but relents not
isabella what a merit were it in death to take this poor maid
 from the world what corruption in this life that
 it will let this man live but how out of this can she avail
