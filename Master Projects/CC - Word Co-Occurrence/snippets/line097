will a man leave the snow of lebanon which cometh from the rock of the field or shall the cold flowing waters that come from another place be forsaken
because my people hath forgotten me they have burned incense to vanity and they have caused them to stumble in their ways from the ancient paths to walk in paths in a way not cast up
to make their land desolate and a perpetual hissing every one that passeth thereby shall be astonished and wag his head
i will scatter them as with an east wind before the enemy i will shew them the back and not the face in the day of their calamity
then said they come and let us devise devices against jeremiah for the law shall not perish from the priest nor counsel from the wise nor the word from the prophet come and let us smite him with the tongue and let us not give heed to any of his words
give heed to me o lord and hearken to the voice of them that contend with me
shall evil be recompensed for good for they have digged a pit for my soul remember that i stood before thee to speak good for them and to turn away thy wrath from them
therefore deliver up their children to the famine and pour out their blood by the force of the sword and let their wives be bereaved of their children and be widows and let their men be put to death let their young men be slain by the sword in battle
let a cry be heard from their houses when thou shalt bring a troop suddenly upon them for they have digged a pit to take me and hid snares for my feet
yet lord thou knowest all their counsel against me to slay me forgive not their iniquity neither blot out their sin from thy sight but let them be overthrown before thee deal thus with them in the time of thine anger
thus saith the lord go and get a potter's earthen bottle and take of the ancients of the people and of the ancients of the priests
and go forth unto the valley of the son of hinnom which is by the entry of the east gate and proclaim there the words that i shall tell thee
and say hear ye the word of the lord o kings of judah and inhabitants of jerusalem thus saith the lord of hosts the god of israel behold i will bring evil upon this place the which whosoever heareth his ears shall tingle
because they have forsaken me and have estranged this place and have burned incense in it unto other gods whom neither they nor their fathers have known nor the kings of judah and have filled this place with the blood of innocents
they have built also the high places of baal to burn their sons with fire for burnt offerings unto baal which i commanded not nor spake it neither came it into my mind
therefore behold the days come saith the lord that this place shall no more be called tophet nor the valley of the son of hinnom but the valley of slaughter
and i will make void the counsel of judah and jerusalem in this place and i will cause them to fall by the sword before their enemies and by the hands of them that seek their lives and their carcases will i give to be meat for the fowls of the heaven and for the beasts of the earth
and i will make this city desolate and an hissing every one that passeth thereby shall be astonished and hiss because of all the plagues thereof
and i will cause them to eat the flesh of their sons and the flesh of their daughters and they shall eat every one the flesh of his friend in the siege and straitness wherewith their enemies and they that seek their lives shall straiten them
then shalt thou break the bottle in the sight of the men that go with thee
and shalt say unto them thus saith the lord of hosts even so will i break this people and this city as one breaketh a potter's vessel that cannot be made whole again and they shall bury them in tophet till there be no place to bury
thus will i do unto this place saith the lord and to the inhabitants thereof and even make this city as tophet
and the houses of jerusalem and the houses of the kings of judah shall be defiled as the place of tophet because of all the houses upon whose roofs they have burned incense unto all the host of heaven and have poured out drink offerings unto other gods
then came jeremiah from tophet whither the lord had sent him to prophesy and he stood in the court of the lord's house and said to all the people
thus saith the lord of hosts the god of israel behold i will bring upon this city and upon all her towns all the evil that i have pronounced against it because they have hardened their necks that they might not hear my words
now pashur the son of immer the priest who was also chief governor in the house of the lord heard that jeremiah prophesied these things
then pashur smote jeremiah the prophet and put him in the stocks that were in the high gate of benjamin which was by the house of the lord
and it came to pass on the morrow that pashur brought forth jeremiah out of the stocks then said jeremiah unto him the lord hath not called thy name pashur but magormissabib
for thus saith the lord behold i will make thee a terror to thyself and to all thy friends and they shall fall by the sword of their enemies and thine eyes shall behold it and i will give all judah into the hand of the king of babylon and he shall carry them captive into babylon and shall slay them with the sword
moreover i will deliver all the strength of this city and all the labours thereof and all the precious things thereof and all the treasures of the kings of judah will i give into the hand of their enemies which shall spoil them and take them and carry them to babylon
and thou pashur and all that dwell in thine house shall go into captivity and thou shalt come to babylon and there thou shalt die and shalt be buried there thou and all thy friends to whom thou hast prophesied lies
o lord thou hast deceived me and i was deceived thou art stronger than i and hast prevailed i am in derision daily every one mocketh me
for since i spake i cried out i cried violence and spoil because the word of the lord was made a reproach unto me and a derision daily
then i said i will not make mention of him nor speak any more in his name but his word was in mine heart as a burning fire shut up in my bones and i was weary with forbearing and i could not stay
for i heard the defaming of many fear on every side report say they and we will report it all my familiars watched for my halting saying peradventure he will be enticed and we shall prevail against him and we shall take our revenge on him
but the lord is with me as a mighty terrible one therefore my persecutors shall stumble and they shall not prevail they shall be greatly ashamed for they shall not prosper their everlasting confusion shall never be forgotten
but o lord of hosts that triest the righteous and seest the reins and the heart let me see thy vengeance on them for unto thee have i opened my cause
sing unto the lord praise ye the lord for he hath delivered the soul of the poor from the hand of evildoers
cursed be the day wherein i was born let not the day wherein my mother bare me be blessed
cursed be the man who brought tidings to my father saying a man child is born unto thee making him very glad
and let that man be as the cities which the lord overthrew and repented not and let him hear the cry in the morning and the shouting at noontide
because he slew me not from the womb or that my mother might have been my grave and her womb to be always great with me
wherefore came i forth out of the womb to see labour and sorrow that my days should be consumed with shame
the word which came unto jeremiah from the lord when king zedekiah sent unto him pashur the son of melchiah and zephaniah the son of maaseiah the priest saying
enquire i pray thee of the lord for us for nebuchadrezzar king of babylon maketh war against us if so be that the lord will deal with us according to all his wondrous works that he may go up from us
then said jeremiah unto them thus shall ye say to zedekiah
thus saith the lord god of israel behold i will turn back the weapons of war that are in your hands wherewith ye fight against the king of babylon and against the chaldeans which besiege you without the walls and i will assemble them into the midst of this city
and i myself will fight against you with an outstretched hand and with a strong arm even in anger and in fury and in great wrath
and i will smite the inhabitants of this city both man and beast they shall die of a great pestilence
and afterward saith the lord i will deliver zedekiah king of judah and his servants and the people and such as are left in this city from the pestilence from the sword and from the famine into the hand of nebuchadrezzar king of babylon and into the hand of their enemies and into the hand of those that seek their life and he shall smite them with the edge of the sword he shall not spare them neither have pity nor have mercy
and unto this people thou shalt say thus saith the lord behold i set before you the way of life and the way of death
he that abideth in this city shall die by the sword and by the famine and by the pestilence but he that goeth out and falleth to the chaldeans that besiege you he shall live and his life shall be unto him for a prey
for i have set my face against this city for evil and not for good saith the lord it shall be given into the hand of the king of babylon and he shall burn it with fire
and touching the house of the king of judah say hear ye the word of the lord
o house of david thus saith the lord execute judgment in the morning and deliver him that is spoiled out of the hand of the oppressor lest my fury go out like fire and burn that none can quench it because of the evil of your doings
behold i am against thee o inhabitant of the valley and rock of the plain saith the lord which say who shall come down against us or who shall enter into our habitations
but i will punish you according to the fruit of your doings saith the lord and i will kindle a fire in the forest thereof and it shall devour all things round about it
thus saith the lord go down to the house of the king of judah and speak there this word
and say hear the word of the lord o king of judah that sittest upon the throne of david thou and thy servants and thy people that enter in by these gates
thus saith the lord execute ye judgment and righteousness and deliver the spoiled out of the hand of the oppressor and do no wrong do no violence to the stranger the fatherless nor the widow neither shed innocent blood in this place
for if ye do this thing indeed then shall there enter in by the gates of this house kings sitting upon the throne of david riding in chariots and on horses he and his servants and his people
but if ye will not hear these words i swear by myself saith the lord that this house shall become a desolation
for thus saith the lord unto the king's house of judah thou art gilead unto me and the head of lebanon yet surely i will make thee a wilderness and cities which are not inhabited
and i will prepare destroyers against thee every one with his weapons and they shall cut down thy choice cedars and cast them into the fire
and many nations shall pass by this city and they shall say every man to his neighbour wherefore hath the lord done thus unto this great city
then they shall answer because they have forsaken the covenant of the lord their god and worshipped other gods and served them
weep ye not for the dead neither bemoan him but weep sore for him that goeth away for he shall return no more nor see his native country
for thus saith the lord touching shallum the son of josiah king of judah which reigned instead of josiah his father which went forth out of this place he shall not return thither any more
but he shall die in the place whither they have led him captive and shall see this land no more
woe unto him that buildeth his house by unrighteousness and his chambers by wrong that useth his neighbour's service without wages and giveth him not for his work
that saith i will build me a wide house and large chambers and cutteth him out windows and it is cieled with cedar and painted with vermilion
shalt thou reign because thou closest thyself in cedar did not thy father eat and drink and do judgment and justice and then it was well with him
he judged the cause of the poor and needy then it was well with him was not this to know me saith the lord
but thine eyes and thine heart are not but for thy covetousness and for to shed innocent blood and for oppression and for violence to do it
therefore thus saith the lord concerning jehoiakim the son of josiah king of judah they shall not lament for him saying ah my brother or ah sister they shall not lament for him saying ah lord or ah his glory
he shall be buried with the burial of an ass drawn and cast forth beyond the gates of jerusalem
go up to lebanon and cry and lift up thy voice in bashan and cry from the passages for all thy lovers are destroyed
i spake unto thee in thy prosperity but thou saidst i will not hear this hath been thy manner from thy youth that thou obeyedst not my voice
the wind shall eat up all thy pastors and thy lovers shall go into captivity surely then shalt thou be ashamed and confounded for all thy wickedness
o inhabitant of lebanon that makest thy nest in the cedars how gracious shalt thou be when pangs come upon thee the pain as of a woman in travail
as i live saith the lord though coniah the son of jehoiakim king of judah were the signet upon my right hand yet would i pluck thee thence
and i will give thee into the hand of them that seek thy life and into the hand of them whose face thou fearest even into the hand of nebuchadrezzar king of babylon and into the hand of the chaldeans
and i will cast thee out and thy mother that bare thee into another country where ye were not born and there shall ye die
but to the land whereunto they desire to return thither shall they not return
is this man coniah a despised broken idol is he a vessel wherein is no pleasure wherefore are they cast out he and his seed and are cast into a land which they know not
o earth earth earth hear the word of the lord
thus saith the lord write ye this man childless a man that shall not prosper in his days for no man of his seed shall prosper sitting upon the throne of david and ruling any more in judah
woe be unto the pastors that destroy and scatter the sheep of my pasture saith the lord
therefore thus saith the lord god of israel against the pastors that feed my people ye have scattered my flock and driven them away and have not visited them behold i will visit upon you the evil of your doings saith the lord
and i will gather the remnant of my flock out of all countries whither i have driven them and will bring them again to their folds and they shall be fruitful and increase
and i will set up shepherds over them which shall feed them and they shall fear no more nor be dismayed neither shall they be lacking saith the lord
behold the days come saith the lord that i will raise unto david a righteous branch and a king shall reign and prosper and shall execute judgment and justice in the earth
in his days judah shall be saved and israel shall dwell safely and this is his name whereby he shall be called the lord our righteousness
therefore behold the days come saith the lord that they shall no more say the lord liveth which brought up the children of israel out of the land of egypt
but the lord liveth which brought up and which led the seed of the house of israel out of the north country and from all countries whither i had driven them and they shall dwell in their own land
mine heart within me is broken because of the prophets all my bones shake i am like a drunken man and like a man whom wine hath overcome because of the lord and because of the words of his holiness
for the land is full of adulterers for because of swearing the land mourneth the pleasant places of the wilderness are dried up and their course is evil and their force is not right
for both prophet and priest are profane yea in my house have i found their wickedness saith the lord
wherefore their way shall be unto them as slippery ways in the darkness they shall be driven on and fall therein for i will bring evil upon them even the year of their visitation saith the lord
and i have seen folly in the prophets of samaria they prophesied in baal and caused my people israel to err
i have seen also in the prophets of jerusalem an horrible thing they commit adultery and walk in lies they strengthen also the hands of evildoers that none doth return from his wickedness they are all of them unto me as sodom and the inhabitants thereof as gomorrah
therefore thus saith the lord of hosts concerning the prophets behold i will feed them with wormwood and make them drink the water of gall for from the prophets of jerusalem is profaneness gone forth into all the land
thus saith the lord of hosts hearken not unto the words of the prophets that prophesy unto you they make you vain they speak a vision of their own heart and not out of the mouth of the lord
they say still unto them that despise me the lord hath said ye shall have peace and they say unto every one that walketh after the imagination of his own heart no evil shall come upon you
for who hath stood in the counsel of the lord and hath perceived and heard his word who hath marked his word and heard it
behold a whirlwind of the lord is gone forth in fury even a grievous whirlwind it shall fall grievously upon the head of the wicked
the anger of the lord shall not return until he have executed and till he have performed the thoughts of his heart in the latter days ye shall consider it perfectly
i have not sent these prophets yet they ran i have not spoken to them yet they prophesied
but if they had stood in my counsel and had caused my people to hear my words then they should have turned them from their evil way and from the evil of their doings
am i a god at hand saith the lord and not a god afar off
can any hide himself in secret places that i shall not see him saith the lord do not i fill heaven and earth saith the lord
i have heard what the prophets said that prophesy lies in my name saying i have dreamed i have dreamed
how long shall this be in the heart of the prophets that prophesy lies yea they are prophets of the deceit of their own heart
which think to cause my people to forget my name by their dreams which they tell every man to his neighbour as their fathers have forgotten my name for baal
the prophet that hath a dream let him tell a dream and he that hath my word let him speak my word faithfully what is the chaff to the wheat saith the lord
is not my word like as a fire saith the lord and like a hammer that breaketh the rock in pieces
therefore behold i am against the prophets saith the lord that steal my words every one from his neighbour
behold i am against the prophets saith the lord that use their tongues and say he saith
behold i am against them that prophesy false dreams saith the lord and do tell them and cause my people to err by their lies and by their lightness yet i sent them not nor commanded them therefore they shall not profit this people at all saith the lord
and when this people or the prophet or a priest shall ask thee saying what is the burden of the lord thou shalt then say unto them what burden i will even forsake you saith the lord
and as for the prophet and the priest and the people that shall say the burden of the lord i will even punish that man and his house
thus shall ye say every one to his neighbour and every one to his brother what hath the lord answered and what hath the lord spoken
and the burden of the lord shall ye mention no more for every man's word shall be his burden for ye have perverted the words of the living god of the lord of hosts our god
thus shalt thou say to the prophet what hath the lord answered thee and what hath the lord spoken
but since ye say the burden of the lord therefore thus saith the lord because ye say this word the burden of the lord and i have sent unto you saying ye shall not say the burden of the lord
therefore behold i even i will utterly forget you and i will forsake you and the city that i gave you and your fathers and cast you out of my presence
and i will bring an everlasting reproach upon you and a perpetual shame which shall not be forgotten
the lord shewed me and behold two baskets of figs were set before the temple of the lord after that nebuchadrezzar king of babylon had carried away captive jeconiah the son of jehoiakim king of judah and the princes of judah with the carpenters and smiths from jerusalem and had brought them to babylon
one basket had very good figs even like the figs that are first ripe and the other basket had very naughty figs which could not be eaten they were so bad
then said the lord unto me what seest thou jeremiah and i said figs the good figs very good and the evil very evil that cannot be eaten they are so evil
again the word of the lord came unto me saying
thus saith the lord the god of israel like these good figs so will i acknowledge them that are carried away captive of judah whom i have sent out of this place into the land of the chaldeans for their good
for i will set mine eyes upon them for good and i will bring them again to this land and i will build them and not pull them down and i will plant them and not pluck them up
and i will give them an heart to know me that i am the lord and they shall be my people and i will be their god for they shall return unto me with their whole heart
and as the evil figs which cannot be eaten they are so evil surely thus saith the lord so will i give zedekiah the king of judah and his princes and the residue of jerusalem that remain in this land and them that dwell in the land of egypt
and i will deliver them to be removed into all the kingdoms of the earth for their hurt to be a reproach and a proverb a taunt and a curse in all places whither i shall drive them
and i will send the sword the famine and the pestilence among them till they be consumed from off the land that i gave unto them and to their fathers
the word that came to jeremiah concerning all the people of judah in the fourth year of jehoiakim the son of josiah king of judah that was the first year of nebuchadrezzar king of babylon
the which jeremiah the prophet spake unto all the people of judah and to all the inhabitants of jerusalem saying
from the thirteenth year of josiah the son of amon king of judah even unto this day that is the three and twentieth year the word of the lord hath come unto me and i have spoken unto you rising early and speaking but ye have not hearkened
and the lord hath sent unto you all his servants the prophets rising early and sending them but ye have not hearkened nor inclined your ear to hear
they said turn ye again now every one from his evil way and from the evil of your doings and dwell in the land that the lord hath given unto you and to your fathers for ever and ever
and go not after other gods to serve them and to worship them and provoke me not to anger with the works of your hands and i will do you no hurt
yet ye have not hearkened unto me saith the lord that ye might provoke me to anger with the works of your hands to your own hurt
therefore thus saith the lord of hosts because ye have not heard my words
behold i will send and take all the families of the north saith the lord and nebuchadrezzar the king of babylon my servant and will bring them against this land and against the inhabitants thereof and against all these nations round about and will utterly destroy them and make them an astonishment and an hissing and perpetual desolations
moreover i will take from them the voice of mirth and the voice of gladness the voice of the bridegroom and the voice of the bride the sound of the millstones and the light of the candle
and this whole land shall be a desolation and an astonishment and these nations shall serve the king of babylon seventy years
and it shall come to pass when seventy years are accomplished that i will punish the king of babylon and that nation saith the lord for their iniquity and the land of the chaldeans and will make it perpetual desolations
and i will bring upon that land all my words which i have pronounced against it even all that is written in this book which jeremiah hath prophesied against all the nations
for many nations and great kings shall serve themselves of them also and i will recompense them according to their deeds and according to the works of their own hands
for thus saith the lord god of israel unto me take the wine cup of this fury at my hand and cause all the nations to whom i send thee to drink it
and they shall drink and be moved and be mad because of the sword that i will send among them
then took i the cup at the lord's hand and made all the nations to drink unto whom the lord had sent me
to wit jerusalem and the cities of judah and the kings thereof and the princes thereof to make them a desolation an astonishment an hissing and a curse as it is this day
pharaoh king of egypt and his servants and his princes and all his people
and all the mingled people and all the kings of the land of uz and all the kings of the land of the philistines and ashkelon and azzah and ekron and the remnant of ashdod
edom and moab and the children of ammon
and all the kings of tyrus and all the kings of zidon and the kings of the isles which are beyond the sea
dedan and tema and buz and all that are in the utmost corners
and all the kings of arabia and all the kings of the mingled people that dwell in the desert
and all the kings of zimri and all the kings of elam and all the kings of the medes
and all the kings of the north far and near one with another and all the kingdoms of the world which are upon the face of the earth and the king of sheshach shall drink after them
therefore thou shalt say unto them thus saith the lord of hosts the god of israel drink ye and be drunken and spue and fall and rise no more because of the sword which i will send among you
and it shall be if they refuse to take the cup at thine hand to drink then shalt thou say unto them thus saith the lord of hosts ye shall certainly drink
for lo i begin to bring evil on the city which is called by my name and should ye be utterly unpunished ye shall not be unpunished for i will call for a sword upon all the inhabitants of the earth saith the lord of hosts
therefore prophesy thou against them all these words and say unto them the lord shall roar from on high and utter his voice from his holy habitation he shall mightily roar upon his habitation he shall give a shout as they that tread the grapes against all the inhabitants of the earth
a noise shall come even to the ends of the earth for the lord hath a controversy with the nations he will plead with all flesh he will give them that are wicked to the sword saith the lord
thus saith the lord of hosts behold evil shall go forth from nation to nation and a great whirlwind shall be raised up from the coasts of the earth
and the slain of the lord shall be at that day from one end of the earth even unto the other end of the earth they shall not be lamented neither gathered nor buried they shall be dung upon the ground
howl ye shepherds and cry and wallow yourselves in the ashes ye principal of the flock for the days of your slaughter and of your dispersions are accomplished and ye shall fall like a pleasant vessel
and the shepherds shall have no way to flee nor the principal of the flock to escape
a voice of the cry of the shepherds and an howling of the principal of the flock shall be heard for the lord hath spoiled their pasture
and the peaceable habitations are cut down because of the fierce anger of the lord
he hath forsaken his covert as the lion for their land is desolate because of the fierceness of the oppressor and because of his fierce anger
in the beginning of the reign of jehoiakim the son of josiah king of judah came this word from the lord saying
thus saith the lord stand in the court of the lord's house and speak unto all the cities of judah which come to worship in the lord's house all the words that i command thee to speak unto them diminish not a word
if so be they will hearken and turn every man from his evil way that i may repent me of the evil which i purpose to do unto them because of the evil of their doings
and thou shalt say unto them thus saith the lord if ye will not hearken to me to walk in my law which i have set before you
to hearken to the words of my servants the prophets whom i sent unto you both rising up early and sending them but ye have not hearkened
then will i make this house like shiloh and will make this city a curse to all the nations of the earth
so the priests and the prophets and all the people heard jeremiah speaking these words in the house of the lord
now it came to pass when jeremiah had made an end of speaking all that the lord had commanded him to speak unto all the people that the priests and the prophets and all the people took him saying thou shalt surely die
why hast thou prophesied in the name of the lord saying this house shall be like shiloh and this city shall be desolate without an inhabitant and all the people were gathered against jeremiah in the house of the lord
when the princes of judah heard these things then they came up from the king's house unto the house of the lord and sat down in the entry of the new gate of the lord's house
then spake the priests and the prophets unto the princes and to all the people saying this man is worthy to die for he hath prophesied against this city as ye have heard with your ears
then spake jeremiah unto all the princes and to all the people saying the lord sent me to prophesy against this house and against this city all the words that ye have heard
therefore now amend your ways and your doings and obey the voice of the lord your god and the lord will repent him of the evil that he hath pronounced against you
as for me behold i am in your hand do with me as seemeth good and meet unto you
but know ye for certain that if ye put me to death ye shall surely bring innocent blood upon yourselves and upon this city and upon the inhabitants thereof for of a truth the lord hath sent me unto you to speak all these words in your ears
then said the princes and all the people unto the priests and to the prophets this man is not worthy to die for he hath spoken to us in the name of the lord our god
then rose up certain of the elders of the land and spake to all the assembly of the people saying
micah the morasthite prophesied in the days of hezekiah king of judah and spake to all the people of judah saying thus saith the lord of hosts zion shall be plowed like a field and jerusalem shall become heaps and the mountain of the house as the high places of a forest
did hezekiah king of judah and all judah put him at all to death did he not fear the lord and besought the lord and the lord repented him of the evil which he had pronounced against them thus might we procure great evil against our souls
and there was also a man that prophesied in the name of the lord urijah the son of shemaiah of kirjathjearim who prophesied against this city and against this land according to all the words of jeremiah
and when jehoiakim the king with all his mighty men and all the princes heard his words the king sought to put him to death but when urijah heard it he was afraid and fled and went into egypt
and jehoiakim the king sent men into egypt namely elnathan the son of achbor and certain men with him into egypt
and they fetched forth urijah out of egypt and brought him unto jehoiakim the king who slew him with the sword and cast his dead body into the graves of the common people
nevertheless the hand of ahikam the son of shaphan was with jeremiah that they should not give him into the hand of the people to put him to death
in the beginning of the reign of jehoiakim the son of josiah king of judah came this word unto jeremiah from the lord saying
