a player fear not my lord we can contain ourselves
 were he the veriest antic in the world
lord go sirrah take them to the buttery
 and give them friendly welcome every one
 let them want nothing that my house affords
 exit one with the players
 sirrah go you to barthol'mew my page
 and see him dress'd in all suits like a lady
 that done conduct him to the drunkard's chamber
 and call him madam do him obeisance
 tell him from me as he will win my love
 he bear himself with honourable action
 such as he hath observed in noble ladies
 unto their lords by them accomplished
 such duty to the drunkard let him do
 with soft low tongue and lowly courtesy
 and say what is't your honour will command
 wherein your lady and your humble wife
 may show her duty and make known her love'
 and then with kind embracements tempting kisses
 and with declining head into his bosom
 bid him shed tears as being overjoy'd
 to see her noble lord restored to health
 who for this seven years hath esteem'd him
 no better than a poor and loathsome beggar
 and if the boy have not a woman's gift
 to rain a shower of commanded tears
 an onion will do well for such a shift
 which in a napkin being close convey'd
 shall in despite enforce a watery eye
 see this dispatch'd with all the haste thou canst
 anon i'll give thee more instructions
 exit a servingman
 i know the boy will well usurp the grace
 voice gait and action of a gentlewoman
 i long to hear him call the drunkard husband
 and how my men will stay themselves from laughter
 when they do homage to this simple peasant
 i'll in to counsel them haply my presence
 may well abate the overmerry spleen
 which otherwise would grow into extremes

scene ii a bedchamber in the lord's house
 enter aloft sly with attendants some with apparel
 others with basin and ewer and appurtenances and lord
sly for god's sake a pot of small ale
first servant will't please your lordship drink a cup of sack
second servant will't please your honour taste of these conserves
third servant what raiment will your honour wear today

 lordship i ne'er drank sack in my life and if
 you give me any conserves give me conserves of
 beef ne'er ask me what raiment i'll wear for i
 have no more doublets than backs no more stockings
 than legs nor no more shoes than feet nay
 sometimes more feet than shoes or such shoes as my
 toes look through the overleather
lord heaven cease this idle humour in your honour
 o that a mighty man of such descent
 of such possessions and so high esteem
 should be infused with so foul a spirit
sly what would you make me mad am not i christopher
 sly old sly's son of burtonheath by birth a
 pedlar by education a cardmaker by transmutation a
 bearherd and now by present profession a tinker

 on the score for sheer ale score me up for the
 lyingest knave in christendom what i am not
 bestraught here's
third servant o this it is that makes your lady mourn
second servant o this is it that makes your servants droop
lord hence comes it that your kindred shuns your house
 as beaten hence by your strange lunacy
 o noble lord bethink thee of thy birth
 call home thy ancient thoughts from banishment
 and banish hence these abject lowly dreams
 look how thy servants do attend on thee
 each in his office ready at thy beck
 wilt thou have music hark apollo plays
 music
 and twenty caged nightingales do sing
 or wilt thou sleep we'll have thee to a couch
 softer and sweeter than the lustful bed
 on purpose trimm'd up for semiramis
 say thou wilt walk we will bestrew the ground
 or wilt thou ride thy horses shall be trapp'd
 their harness studded all with gold and pearl
 dost thou love hawking thou hast hawks will soar
 above the morning lark or wilt thou hunt
 thy hounds shall make the welkin answer them
 and fetch shrill echoes from the hollow earth
first servant say thou wilt course thy greyhounds are as swift
 as breathed stags ay fleeter than the roe
second servant dost thou love pictures we will fetch thee straight
 adonis painted by a running brook
 and cytherea all in sedges hid
 which seem to move and wanton with her breath
 even as the waving sedges play with wind
lord we'll show thee io as she was a maid
 and how she was beguiled and surprised
 as lively painted as the deed was done
third servant or daphne roaming through a thorny wood
 scratching her legs that one shall swear she bleeds
 and at that sight shall sad apollo weep
 so workmanly the blood and tears are drawn
lord thou art a lord and nothing but a lord
 thou hast a lady far more beautiful
 than any woman in this waning age
first servant and till the tears that she hath shed for thee
 like envious floods o'errun her lovely face
 she was the fairest creature in the world
 and yet she is inferior to none
sly am i a lord and have i such a lady
 or do i dream or have i dream'd till now
 i do not sleep i see i hear i speak
 i smell sweet savours and i feel soft things
 upon my life i am a lord indeed
 and not a tinker nor christophero sly
 well bring our lady hither to our sight
 and once again a pot o the smallest ale
second servant will't please your mightiness to wash your hands
 o how we joy to see your wit restored
 o that once more you knew but what you are
 these fifteen years you have been in a dream
 or when you waked so waked as if you slept
sly these fifteen years by my fay a goodly nap
 but did i never speak of all that time
first servant o yes my lord but very idle words
 for though you lay here in this goodly chamber
 yet would you say ye were beaten out of door
 and rail upon the hostess of the house
 and say you would present her at the leet
 because she brought stone jugs and no seal'd quarts
 sometimes you would call out for cicely hacket
sly ay the woman's maid of the house
third servant why sir you know no house nor no such maid
 nor no such men as you have reckon'd up
 as stephen sly and did john naps of greece
 and peter turph and henry pimpernell
 and twenty more such names and men as these
 which never were nor no man ever saw

sly tis much servants leave me and her alone
 madam undress you and come now to bed
page thrice noble lord let me entreat of you
 to pardon me yet for a night or two
 or if not so until the sun be set
 for your physicians have expressly charged
 in peril to incur your former malady
 that i should yet absent me from your bed
 i hope this reason stands for my excuse
sly ay it stands so that i may hardly
 tarry so long but i would be loath to fall into
 my dreams again i will therefore tarry in
 despite of the flesh and the blood
 enter a messenger
messenger your honour's players heating your amendment
 are come to play a pleasant comedy
 for so your doctors hold it very meet
 seeing too much sadness hath congeal'd your blood
 and melancholy is the nurse of frenzy
 therefore they thought it good you hear a play
 and frame your mind to mirth and merriment
 which bars a thousand harms and lengthens life
sly marry i will let them play it is not a
 comondy a christmas gambold or a tumblingtrick
page no my good lord it is more pleasing stuff
