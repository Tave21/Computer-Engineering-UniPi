 with your derision none of noble sort
 would so offend a virgin and extort
 a poor soul's patience all to make you sport
lysander you are unkind demetrius be not so
 for you love hermia this you know i know
 and here with all good will with all my heart
 in hermia's love i yield you up my part
 and yours of helena to me bequeath
 whom i do love and will do till my death
helena never did mockers waste more idle breath
demetrius lysander keep thy hermia i will none
 if e'er i loved her all that love is gone
 my heart to her but as guestwise sojourn'd
 and now to helen is it home return'd
 there to remain
lysander helen it is not so
demetrius disparage not the faith thou dost not know
 lest to thy peril thou aby it dear
 look where thy love comes yonder is thy dear
 reenter hermia
hermia dark night that from the eye his function takes
 the ear more quick of apprehension makes
 wherein it doth impair the seeing sense
 it pays the hearing double recompense
 thou art not by mine eye lysander found
 mine ear i thank it brought me to thy sound
 but why unkindly didst thou leave me so
lysander why should he stay whom love doth press to go
hermia what love could press lysander from my side
lysander lysander's love that would not let him bide
 fair helena who more engilds the night
 than all you fiery oes and eyes of light
 why seek'st thou me could not this make thee know
 the hate i bear thee made me leave thee so
hermia you speak not as you think it cannot be
helena lo she is one of this confederacy
 now i perceive they have conjoin'd all three
 to fashion this false sport in spite of me
 injurious hermia most ungrateful maid
 have you conspired have you with these contrived
 to bait me with this foul derision
 is all the counsel that we two have shared
 the sisters vows the hours that we have spent
 when we have chid the hastyfooted time
 for parting uso is it all forgot
 all schooldays friendship childhood innocence
 we hermia like two artificial gods
 have with our needles created both one flower
 both on one sampler sitting on one cushion
 both warbling of one song both in one key
 as if our hands our sides voices and minds
 had been incorporate so we grow together
 like to a double cherry seeming parted
 but yet an union in partition
 two lovely berries moulded on one stem
 so with two seeming bodies but one heart
 two of the first like coats in heraldry
 due but to one and crowned with one crest
 and will you rent our ancient love asunder
 to join with men in scorning your poor friend
 it is not friendly tis not maidenly
 our sex as well as i may chide you for it
 though i alone do feel the injury
hermia i am amazed at your passionate words
 i scorn you not it seems that you scorn me
helena have you not set lysander as in scorn
 to follow me and praise my eyes and face
 and made your other love demetrius
 who even but now did spurn me with his foot
 to call me goddess nymph divine and rare
 precious celestial wherefore speaks he this
 to her he hates and wherefore doth lysander
 deny your love so rich within his soul
 and tender me forsooth affection
 but by your setting on by your consent
 what thought i be not so in grace as you
 so hung upon with love so fortunate
 but miserable most to love unloved
 this you should pity rather than despise
hernia i understand not what you mean by this
helena ay do persever counterfeit sad looks
 make mouths upon me when i turn my back
 wink each at other hold the sweet jest up
 this sport well carried shall be chronicled
 if you have any pity grace or manners
 you would not make me such an argument
 but fare ye well tis partly my own fault
 which death or absence soon shall remedy
lysander stay gentle helena hear my excuse
 my love my life my soul fair helena
helena o excellent
hermia sweet do not scorn her so
demetrius if she cannot entreat i can compel
lysander thou canst compel no more than she entreat
 thy threats have no more strength than her weak prayers
 helen i love thee by my life i do
 i swear by that which i will lose for thee
 to prove him false that says i love thee not
demetrius i say i love thee more than he can do
lysander if thou say so withdraw and prove it too
demetrius quick come
hermia lysander whereto tends all this
lysander away you ethiope
demetrius no no he'll 
 seem to break loose take on as you would follow
 but yet come not you are a tame man go
lysander hang off thou cat thou burr vile thing let loose
 or i will shake thee from me like a serpent
hermia why are you grown so rude what change is this
 sweet love
lysander thy love out tawny tartar out
 out loathed medicine hated potion hence
hermia do you not jest
helena yes sooth and so do you
lysander demetrius i will keep my word with thee
demetrius i would i had your bond for i perceive
 a weak bond holds you i'll not trust your word
lysander what should i hurt her strike her kill her dead
 although i hate her i'll not harm her so
hermia what can you do me greater harm than hate
 hate me wherefore o me what news my love
 am not i hermia are not you lysander
 i am as fair now as i was erewhile
 since night you loved me yet since night you left
 me
 why then you left meo the gods forbid
 in earnest shall i say
lysander ay by my life
 and never did desire to see thee more
 therefore be out of hope of question of doubt
 be certain nothing truer tis no jest
 that i do hate thee and love helena
hermia o me you juggler you cankerblossom
 you thief of love what have you come by night
 and stolen my love's heart from him
helena fine i'faith
 have you no modesty no maiden shame
 no touch of bashfulness what will you tear
 impatient answers from my gentle tongue
 fie fie you counterfeit you puppet you
hermia puppet why so ay that way goes the game
 now i perceive that she hath made compare
 between our statures she hath urged her height
 and with her personage her tall personage
 her height forsooth she hath prevail'd with him
 and are you grown so high in his esteem
 because i am so dwarfish and so low
 how low am i thou painted maypole speak
 how low am i i am not yet so low
 but that my nails can reach unto thine eyes
helena i pray you though you mock me gentlemen
 let her not hurt me i was never curst
 i have no gift at all in shrewishness
 i am a right maid for my cowardice
 let her not strike me you perhaps may think
 because she is something lower than myself
 that i can match her
hermia lower hark again
helena good hermia do not be so bitter with me
 i evermore did love you hermia
 did ever keep your counsels never wrong'd you
 save that in love unto demetrius
 i told him of your stealth unto this wood
 he follow'd you for love i follow'd him
 but he hath chid me hence and threaten'd me
 to strike me spurn me nay to kill me too
 and now so you will let me quiet go
 to athens will i bear my folly back
 and follow you no further let me go
 you see how simple and how fond i am
hermia why get you gone who is't that hinders you
helena a foolish heart that i leave here behind
hermia what with lysander
helena with demetrius
lysander be not afraid she shall not harm thee helena
demetrius no sir she shall not though you take her part
helena o when she's angry she is keen and shrewd
 she was a vixen when she went to school
 and though she be but little she is fierce
hermia little again nothing but low and little'
 why will you suffer her to flout me thus
 let me come to her
lysander get you gone you dwarf
 you minimus of hindering knotgrass made
 you bead you acorn
demetrius you are too officious
 in her behalf that scorns your services
 let her alone speak not of helena
 take not her part for if thou dost intend
 never so little show of love to her
 thou shalt aby it
lysander now she holds me not
 now follow if thou darest to try whose right
 of thine or mine is most in helena
demetrius follow nay i'll go with thee cheek by jole
 exeunt lysander and demetrius
hermia you mistress all this coil is long of you
 nay go not back
helena i will not trust you i
 nor longer stay in your curst company
