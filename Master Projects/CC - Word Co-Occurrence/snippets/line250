edmund to both these sisters have i sworn my love
 each jealous of the other as the stung
 are of the adder which of them shall i take
 both one or neither neither can be enjoy'd
 if both remain alive to take the widow
 exasperates makes mad her sister goneril
 and hardly shall i carry out my side
 her husband being alive now then we'll use
 his countenance for the battle which being done
 let her who would be rid of him devise
 his speedy taking off as for the mercy
 which he intends to lear and to cordelia
 the battle done and they within our power
 shall never see his pardon for my state
 stands on me to defend not to debate

 flourish enter albany goneril regan another
 captain and soldiers
albany sir you have shown today your valiant strain
 and fortune led you well you have the captives
 that were the opposites of this day's strife
 we do require them of you so to use them
 as we shall find their merits and our safety
 may equally determine
edmund sir i thought it fit
 to send the old and miserable king
 to some retention and appointed guard
 whose age has charms in it whose title more
 to pluck the common bosom on his side
 an turn our impress'd lances in our eyes
 which do command them with him i sent the queen
 my reason all the same and they are ready
 tomorrow or at further space to appear
 where you shall hold your session at this time
 we sweat and bleed the friend hath lost his friend
 and the best quarrels in the heat are cursed
 by those that feel their sharpness
 the question of cordelia and her father
 requires a fitter place
albany sir by your patience
 i hold you but a subject of this war
 not as a brother
regan that's as we list to grace him
 methinks our pleasure might have been demanded
 ere you had spoke so far he led our powers
 bore the commission of my place and person
 the which immediacy may well stand up
 and call itself your brother
goneril not so hot
 in his own grace he doth exalt himself
 more than in your addition
regan in my rights
 by me invested he compeers the best
goneril that were the most if he should husband you
regan jesters do oft prove prophets
goneril holla holla
 that eye that told you so look'd but asquint
regan lady i am not well else i should answer
 from a fullflowing stomach general
 take thou my soldiers prisoners patrimony
 dispose of them of me the walls are thine
 witness the world that i create thee here
 my lord and master
goneril mean you to enjoy him
albany the letalone lies not in your good will
edmund nor in thine lord
albany halfblooded fellow yes
regan to edmund let the drum strike and prove my title thine
albany stay yet hear reason edmund i arrest thee
 on capital treason and in thine attaint
 this gilded serpent
 pointing to goneril
 for your claim fair sister
 i bar it in the interest of my wife
 tis she is subcontracted to this lord
 and i her husband contradict your bans
 if you will marry make your loves to me
 my lady is bespoke
goneril an interlude
albany thou art arm'd gloucester let the trumpet sound
 if none appear to prove upon thy head
 thy heinous manifest and many treasons
 there is my pledge
 throwing down a glove
 i'll prove it on thy heart
 ere i taste bread thou art in nothing less
 than i have here proclaim'd thee
regan sick o sick
goneril aside if not i'll ne'er trust medicine
edmund there's my exchange
 throwing down a glove
 what in the world he is
 that names me traitor villainlike he lies
 call by thy trumpet he that dares approach
 on him on you who not i will maintain
 my truth and honour firmly
albany a herald ho
edmund a herald ho a herald
albany trust to thy single virtue for thy soldiers
