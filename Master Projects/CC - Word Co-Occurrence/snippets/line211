act iv
scene iv a plain in denmark
 enter fortinbras a captain and soldiers marching
prince fortinbras go captain from me greet the danish king
 tell him that by his licence fortinbras
 craves the conveyance of a promised march
 over his kingdom you know the rendezvous
 if that his majesty would aught with us
 we shall express our duty in his eye
 and let him know so
captain i will do't my lord
prince fortinbras go softly on
 exeunt fortinbras and soldiers
 enter hamlet rosencrantz guildenstern and others
hamlet good sir whose powers are these
captain they are of norway sir
hamlet how purposed sir i pray you
captain against some part of poland
hamlet who commands them sir
captain the nephews to old norway fortinbras
hamlet goes it against the main of poland sir
 or for some frontier
captain truly to speak and with no addition
 we go to gain a little patch of ground
 that hath in it no profit but the name
 to pay five ducats five i would not farm it
 nor will it yield to norway or the pole
 a ranker rate should it be sold in fee
hamlet why then the polack never will defend it
captain yes it is already garrison'd
hamlet two thousand souls and twenty thousand ducats
 will not debate the question of this straw
 this is the imposthume of much wealth and peace
 that inward breaks and shows no cause without
 why the man dies i humbly thank you sir
captain god be wi you sir
 exit
rosencrantz wilt please you go my lord
hamlet i'll be with you straight go a little before
 exeunt all except hamlet
 how all occasions do inform against me
 and spur my dull revenge what is a man
 if his chief good and market of his time
 be but to sleep and feed a beast no more
 sure he that made us with such large discourse
 looking before and after gave us not
 that capability and godlike reason
 to fust in us unused now whether it be
 bestial oblivion or some craven scruple
 of thinking too precisely on the event
 a thought which quarter'd hath but one part wisdom
 and ever three parts coward i do not know
 why yet i live to say this thing's to do'
 sith i have cause and will and strength and means
 to do't examples gross as earth exhort me
 witness this army of such mass and charge
 led by a delicate and tender prince
 whose spirit with divine ambition puff'd
 makes mouths at the invisible event
 exposing what is mortal and unsure
 to all that fortune death and danger dare
 even for an eggshell rightly to be great
 is not to stir without great argument
 but greatly to find quarrel in a straw
 when honour's at the stake how stand i then
 that have a father kill'd a mother stain'd
 excitements of my reason and my blood
 and let all sleep while to my shame i see
 the imminent death of twenty thousand men
 that for a fantasy and trick of fame
 go to their graves like beds fight for a plot
 whereon the numbers cannot try the cause
 which is not tomb enough and continent
 to hide the slain o from this time forth
 my thoughts be bloody or be nothing worth
