 the husbandry and manage of my house
 until my lord's return for mine own part
 i have toward heaven breathed a secret vow
 to live in prayer and contemplation
 only attended by nerissa here
 until her husband and my lord's return
 there is a monastery two miles off
 and there will we abide i do desire you
 not to deny this imposition
 the which my love and some necessity
 now lays upon you
lorenzo madam with all my heart
 i shall obey you in all fair commands
portia my people do already know my mind
 and will acknowledge you and jessica
 in place of lord bassanio and myself
 and so farewell till we shall meet again

jessica i wish your ladyship all heart's content
portia i thank you for your wish and am well pleased
 to wish it back on you fare you well jessica
 exeunt jessica and lorenzo

 as i have ever found thee honesttrue
 so let me find thee still take this same letter
 and use thou all the endeavour of a man
 in speed to padua see thou render this
 into my cousin's hand doctor bellario
 and look what notes and garments he doth give thee
 bring them i pray thee with imagined speed
 unto the tranect to the common ferry
 which trades to venice waste no time in words
 but get thee gone i shall be there before thee
balthasar madam i go with all convenient speed
 exit
portia come on nerissa i have work in hand
 that you yet know not of we'll see our husbands
 before they think of us
nerissa shall they see us
portia they shall nerissa but in such a habit
 that they shall think we are accomplished
 with that we lack i'll hold thee any wager
 when we are both accoutred like young men
 i'll prove the prettier fellow of the two
 and wear my dagger with the braver grace
 and speak between the change of man and boy
 with a reed voice and turn two mincing steps
 into a manly stride and speak of frays
 like a fine bragging youth and tell quaint lies
 how honourable ladies sought my love
 which i denying they fell sick and died
 i could not do withal then i'll repent
 and wish for all that that i had not killed them
 and twenty of these puny lies i'll tell
 that men shall swear i have discontinued school
 above a twelvemonth i have within my mind
 a thousand raw tricks of these bragging jacks
 which i will practise
nerissa why shall we turn to men
portia fie what a question's that
 if thou wert near a lewd interpreter
 but come i'll tell thee all my whole device
 when i am in my coach which stays for us
 at the park gate and therefore haste away
 for we must measure twenty miles today

act iii
scene v the same a garden
 enter launcelot and jessica
launcelot yes truly for look you the sins of the father
 are to be laid upon the children therefore i
 promise ye i fear you i was always plain with
 you and so now i speak my agitation of the matter
 therefore be of good cheer for truly i think you
 are damned there is but one hope in it that can do
 you any good and that is but a kind of bastard
 hope neither
jessica and what hope is that i pray thee
launcelot marry you may partly hope that your father got you
 not that you are not the jew's daughter
jessica that were a kind of bastard hope indeed so the
 sins of my mother should be visited upon me
launcelot truly then i fear you are damned both by father and
 mother thus when i shun scylla your father i
 fall into charybdis your mother well you are
 gone both ways
jessica i shall be saved by my husband he hath made me a
 christian
launcelot truly the more to blame he we were christians
 enow before e'en as many as could well live one by
 another this making christians will raise the
 price of hogs if we grow all to be porkeaters we
 shall not shortly have a rasher on the coals for money
 enter lorenzo
jessica i'll tell my husband launcelot what you say here he comes
lorenzo i shall grow jealous of you shortly launcelot if
 you thus get my wife into corners
jessica nay you need not fear us lorenzo launcelot and i
 are out he tells me flatly there is no mercy for
 me in heaven because i am a jew's daughter and he
 says you are no good member of the commonwealth
 for in converting jews to christians you raise the
 price of pork
lorenzo i shall answer that better to the commonwealth than
 you can the getting up of the negro's belly the
 moor is with child by you launcelot
launcelot it is much that the moor should be more than reason
 but if she be less than an honest woman she is
 indeed more than i took her for
lorenzo how every fool can play upon the word i think the
 best grace of wit will shortly turn into silence
 and discourse grow commendable in none only but
 parrots go in sirrah bid them prepare for dinner
launcelot that is done sir they have all stomachs
lorenzo goodly lord what a witsnapper are you then bid
 them prepare dinner
launcelot that is done too sir only cover is the word
lorenzo will you cover then sir
launcelot not so sir neither i know my duty
lorenzo yet more quarrelling with occasion wilt thou show
 the whole wealth of thy wit in an instant i pray
 tree understand a plain man in his plain meaning
 go to thy fellows bid them cover the table serve
 in the meat and we will come in to dinner
launcelot for the table sir it shall be served in for the
 meat sir it shall be covered for your coming in
 to dinner sir why let it be as humours and
 conceits shall govern
 exit
lorenzo o dear discretion how his words are suited
 the fool hath planted in his memory
 an army of good words and i do know
 a many fools that stand in better place
 garnish'd like him that for a tricksy word
 defy the matter how cheerest thou jessica
 and now good sweet say thy opinion
 how dost thou like the lord bassanio's wife
jessica past all expressing it is very meet
 the lord bassanio live an upright life
 for having such a blessing in his lady
 he finds the joys of heaven here on earth
 and if on earth he do not mean it then
 in reason he should never come to heaven
 why if two gods should play some heavenly match
 and on the wager lay two earthly women
 and portia one there must be something else
 pawn'd with the other for the poor rude world
 hath not her fellow
lorenzo even such a husband
 hast thou of me as she is for a wife
jessica nay but ask my opinion too of that
lorenzo i will anon first let us go to dinner
jessica nay let me praise you while i have a stomach
lorenzo no pray thee let it serve for tabletalk
 then howso'er thou speak'st mong other things
 i shall digest it
jessica well i'll set you forth

act iv
scene i venice a court of justice
 enter the duke the magnificoes antonio bassanio
 gratiano salerio and others
duke what is antonio here
antonio ready so please your grace
duke i am sorry for thee thou art come to answer
 a stony adversary an inhuman wretch
 uncapable of pity void and empty
 from any dram of mercy
antonio i have heard
 your grace hath ta'en great pains to qualify
 his rigorous course but since he stands obdurate
 and that no lawful means can carry me
 out of his envy's reach i do oppose
 my patience to his fury and am arm'd
 to suffer with a quietness of spirit
 the very tyranny and rage of his
duke go one and call the jew into the court
salerio he is ready at the door he comes my lord
 enter shylock
duke make room and let him stand before our face
 shylock the world thinks and i think so too
 that thou but lead'st this fashion of thy malice
 to the last hour of act and then tis thought
 thou'lt show thy mercy and remorse more strange
 than is thy strange apparent cruelty
 and where thou now exact'st the penalty
 which is a pound of this poor merchant's flesh
 thou wilt not only loose the forfeiture
 but touch'd with human gentleness and love
 forgive a moiety of the principal
 glancing an eye of pity on his losses
 that have of late so huddled on his back
 enow to press a royal merchant down
 and pluck commiseration of his state
 from brassy bosoms and rough hearts of flint
 from stubborn turks and tartars never train'd
 to offices of tender courtesy
 we all expect a gentle answer jew
