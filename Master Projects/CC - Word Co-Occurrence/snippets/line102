thou hast covered thyself with a cloud that our prayer should not pass through
thou hast made us as the offscouring and refuse in the midst of the people
all our enemies have opened their mouths against us
fear and a snare is come upon us desolation and destruction
mine eye runneth down with rivers of water for the destruction of the daughter of my people
mine eye trickleth down and ceaseth not without any intermission
till the lord look down and behold from heaven
mine eye affecteth mine heart because of all the daughters of my city
mine enemies chased me sore like a bird without cause
they have cut off my life in the dungeon and cast a stone upon me
waters flowed over mine head then i said i am cut off
i called upon thy name o lord out of the low dungeon
thou hast heard my voice hide not thine ear at my breathing at my cry
thou drewest near in the day that i called upon thee thou saidst fear not
o lord thou hast pleaded the causes of my soul thou hast redeemed my life
o lord thou hast seen my wrong judge thou my cause
thou hast seen all their vengeance and all their imaginations against me
thou hast heard their reproach o lord and all their imaginations against me
the lips of those that rose up against me and their device against me all the day
behold their sitting down and their rising up i am their musick
render unto them a recompence o lord according to the work of their hands
give them sorrow of heart thy curse unto them
persecute and destroy them in anger from under the heavens of the lord
how is the gold become dim how is the most fine gold changed the stones of the sanctuary are poured out in the top of every street
the precious sons of zion comparable to fine gold how are they esteemed as earthen pitchers the work of the hands of the potter
even the sea monsters draw out the breast they give suck to their young ones the daughter of my people is become cruel like the ostriches in the wilderness
the tongue of the sucking child cleaveth to the roof of his mouth for thirst the young children ask bread and no man breaketh it unto them
they that did feed delicately are desolate in the streets they that were brought up in scarlet embrace dunghills
for the punishment of the iniquity of the daughter of my people is greater than the punishment of the sin of sodom that was overthrown as in a moment and no hands stayed on her
her nazarites were purer than snow they were whiter than milk they were more ruddy in body than rubies their polishing was of sapphire
their visage is blacker than a coal they are not known in the streets their skin cleaveth to their bones it is withered it is become like a stick
they that be slain with the sword are better than they that be slain with hunger for these pine away stricken through for want of the fruits of the field
the hands of the pitiful women have sodden their own children they were their meat in the destruction of the daughter of my people
the lord hath accomplished his fury he hath poured out his fierce anger and hath kindled a fire in zion and it hath devoured the foundations thereof
the kings of the earth and all the inhabitants of the world would not have believed that the adversary and the enemy should have entered into the gates of jerusalem
for the sins of her prophets and the iniquities of her priests that have shed the blood of the just in the midst of her
they have wandered as blind men in the streets they have polluted themselves with blood so that men could not touch their garments
they cried unto them depart ye it is unclean depart depart touch not when they fled away and wandered they said among the heathen they shall no more sojourn there
the anger of the lord hath divided them he will no more regard them they respected not the persons of the priests they favoured not the elders
as for us our eyes as yet failed for our vain help in our watching we have watched for a nation that could not save us
they hunt our steps that we cannot go in our streets our end is near our days are fulfilled for our end is come
our persecutors are swifter than the eagles of the heaven they pursued us upon the mountains they laid wait for us in the wilderness
the breath of our nostrils the anointed of the lord was taken in their pits of whom we said under his shadow we shall live among the heathen
rejoice and be glad o daughter of edom that dwellest in the land of uz the cup also shall pass through unto thee thou shalt be drunken and shalt make thyself naked
the punishment of thine iniquity is accomplished o daughter of zion he will no more carry thee away into captivity he will visit thine iniquity o daughter of edom he will discover thy sins
remember o lord what is come upon us consider and behold our reproach
our inheritance is turned to strangers our houses to aliens
we are orphans and fatherless our mothers are as widows
we have drunken our water for money our wood is sold unto us
our necks are under persecution we labour and have no rest
we have given the hand to the egyptians and to the assyrians to be satisfied with bread
our fathers have sinned and are not and we have borne their iniquities
servants have ruled over us there is none that doth deliver us out of their hand
we gat our bread with the peril of our lives because of the sword of the wilderness
our skin was black like an oven because of the terrible famine
they ravished the women in zion and the maids in the cities of judah
princes are hanged up by their hand the faces of elders were not honoured
they took the young men to grind and the children fell under the wood
the elders have ceased from the gate the young men from their musick
the joy of our heart is ceased our dance is turned into mourning
the crown is fallen from our head woe unto us that we have sinned
for this our heart is faint for these things our eyes are dim
because of the mountain of zion which is desolate the foxes walk upon it
thou o lord remainest for ever thy throne from generation to generation
wherefore dost thou forget us for ever and forsake us so long time
turn thou us unto thee o lord and we shall be turned renew our days as of old
but thou hast utterly rejected us thou art very wroth against us
now it came to pass in the thirtieth year in the fourth month in the fifth day of the month as i was among the captives by the river of chebar that the heavens were opened and i saw visions of god
in the fifth day of the month which was the fifth year of king jehoiachin's captivity
the word of the lord came expressly unto ezekiel the priest the son of buzi in the land of the chaldeans by the river chebar and the hand of the lord was there upon him
and i looked and behold a whirlwind came out of the north a great cloud and a fire infolding itself and a brightness was about it and out of the midst thereof as the colour of amber out of the midst of the fire
also out of the midst thereof came the likeness of four living creatures and this was their appearance they had the likeness of a man
and every one had four faces and every one had four wings
and their feet were straight feet and the sole of their feet was like the sole of a calf's foot and they sparkled like the colour of burnished brass
and they had the hands of a man under their wings on their four sides and they four had their faces and their wings
their wings were joined one to another they turned not when they went they went every one straight forward
as for the likeness of their faces they four had the face of a man and the face of a lion on the right side and they four had the face of an ox on the left side they four also had the face of an eagle
thus were their faces and their wings were stretched upward two wings of every one were joined one to another and two covered their bodies
and they went every one straight forward whither the spirit was to go they went and they turned not when they went
as for the likeness of the living creatures their appearance was like burning coals of fire and like the appearance of lamps it went up and down among the living creatures and the fire was bright and out of the fire went forth lightning
and the living creatures ran and returned as the appearance of a flash of lightning
now as i beheld the living creatures behold one wheel upon the earth by the living creatures with his four faces
the appearance of the wheels and their work was like unto the colour of a beryl and they four had one likeness and their appearance and their work was as it were a wheel in the middle of a wheel
when they went they went upon their four sides and they turned not when they went
as for their rings they were so high that they were dreadful and their rings were full of eyes round about them four
and when the living creatures went the wheels went by them and when the living creatures were lifted up from the earth the wheels were lifted up
whithersoever the spirit was to go they went thither was their spirit to go and the wheels were lifted up over against them for the spirit of the living creature was in the wheels
when those went these went and when those stood these stood and when those were lifted up from the earth the wheels were lifted up over against them for the spirit of the living creature was in the wheels
and the likeness of the firmament upon the heads of the living creature was as the colour of the terrible crystal stretched forth over their heads above
and under the firmament were their wings straight the one toward the other every one had two which covered on this side and every one had two which covered on that side their bodies
and when they went i heard the noise of their wings like the noise of great waters as the voice of the almighty the voice of speech as the noise of an host when they stood they let down their wings
and there was a voice from the firmament that was over their heads when they stood and had let down their wings
and above the firmament that was over their heads was the likeness of a throne as the appearance of a sapphire stone and upon the likeness of the throne was the likeness as the appearance of a man above upon it
and i saw as the colour of amber as the appearance of fire round about within it from the appearance of his loins even upward and from the appearance of his loins even downward i saw as it were the appearance of fire and it had brightness round about
as the appearance of the bow that is in the cloud in the day of rain so was the appearance of the brightness round about this was the appearance of the likeness of the glory of the lord and when i saw it i fell upon my face and i heard a voice of one that spake
and he said unto me son of man stand upon thy feet and i will speak unto thee
and the spirit entered into me when he spake unto me and set me upon my feet that i heard him that spake unto me
and he said unto me son of man i send thee to the children of israel to a rebellious nation that hath rebelled against me they and their fathers have transgressed against me even unto this very day
for they are impudent children and stiffhearted i do send thee unto them and thou shalt say unto them thus saith the lord god
and they whether they will hear or whether they will forbear for they are a rebellious house yet shall know that there hath been a prophet among them
and thou son of man be not afraid of them neither be afraid of their words though briers and thorns be with thee and thou dost dwell among scorpions be not afraid of their words nor be dismayed at their looks though they be a rebellious house
and thou shalt speak my words unto them whether they will hear or whether they will forbear for they are most rebellious
but thou son of man hear what i say unto thee be not thou rebellious like that rebellious house open thy mouth and eat that i give thee
and when i looked behold an hand was sent unto me and lo a roll of a book was therein
and he spread it before me and it was written within and without and there was written therein lamentations and mourning and woe
moreover he said unto me son of man eat that thou findest eat this roll and go speak unto the house of israel
so i opened my mouth and he caused me to eat that roll
and he said unto me son of man cause thy belly to eat and fill thy bowels with this roll that i give thee then did i eat it and it was in my mouth as honey for sweetness
and he said unto me son of man go get thee unto the house of israel and speak with my words unto them
for thou art not sent to a people of a strange speech and of an hard language but to the house of israel
not to many people of a strange speech and of an hard language whose words thou canst not understand surely had i sent thee to them they would have hearkened unto thee
but the house of israel will not hearken unto thee for they will not hearken unto me for all the house of israel are impudent and hardhearted
behold i have made thy face strong against their faces and thy forehead strong against their foreheads
as an adamant harder than flint have i made thy forehead fear them not neither be dismayed at their looks though they be a rebellious house
moreover he said unto me son of man all my words that i shall speak unto thee receive in thine heart and hear with thine ears
and go get thee to them of the captivity unto the children of thy people and speak unto them and tell them thus saith the lord god whether they will hear or whether they will forbear
then the spirit took me up and i heard behind me a voice of a great rushing saying blessed be the glory of the lord from his place
i heard also the noise of the wings of the living creatures that touched one another and the noise of the wheels over against them and a noise of a great rushing
so the spirit lifted me up and took me away and i went in bitterness in the heat of my spirit but the hand of the lord was strong upon me
then i came to them of the captivity at telabib that dwelt by the river of chebar and i sat where they sat and remained there astonished among them seven days
and it came to pass at the end of seven days that the word of the lord came unto me saying
son of man i have made thee a watchman unto the house of israel therefore hear the word at my mouth and give them warning from me
when i say unto the wicked thou shalt surely die and thou givest him not warning nor speakest to warn the wicked from his wicked way to save his life the same wicked man shall die in his iniquity but his blood will i require at thine hand
yet if thou warn the wicked and he turn not from his wickedness nor from his wicked way he shall die in his iniquity but thou hast delivered thy soul
again when a righteous man doth turn from his righteousness and commit iniquity and i lay a stumblingblock before him he shall die because thou hast not given him warning he shall die in his sin and his righteousness which he hath done shall not be remembered but his blood will i require at thine hand
nevertheless if thou warn the righteous man that the righteous sin not and he doth not sin he shall surely live because he is warned also thou hast delivered thy soul
and the hand of the lord was there upon me and he said unto me arise go forth into the plain and i will there talk with thee
then i arose and went forth into the plain and behold the glory of the lord stood there as the glory which i saw by the river of chebar and i fell on my face
then the spirit entered into me and set me upon my feet and spake with me and said unto me go shut thyself within thine house
but thou o son of man behold they shall put bands upon thee and shall bind thee with them and thou shalt not go out among them
and i will make thy tongue cleave to the roof of thy mouth that thou shalt be dumb and shalt not be to them a reprover for they are a rebellious house
but when i speak with thee i will open thy mouth and thou shalt say unto them thus saith the lord god he that heareth let him hear and he that forbeareth let him forbear for they are a rebellious house
thou also son of man take thee a tile and lay it before thee and pourtray upon it the city even jerusalem
and lay siege against it and build a fort against it and cast a mount against it set the camp also against it and set battering rams against it round about
moreover take thou unto thee an iron pan and set it for a wall of iron between thee and the city and set thy face against it and it shall be besieged and thou shalt lay siege against it this shall be a sign to the house of israel
lie thou also upon thy left side and lay the iniquity of the house of israel upon it according to the number of the days that thou shalt lie upon it thou shalt bear their iniquity
for i have laid upon thee the years of their iniquity according to the number of the days three hundred and ninety days so shalt thou bear the iniquity of the house of israel
and when thou hast accomplished them lie again on thy right side and thou shalt bear the iniquity of the house of judah forty days i have appointed thee each day for a year
therefore thou shalt set thy face toward the siege of jerusalem and thine arm shall be uncovered and thou shalt prophesy against it
and behold i will lay bands upon thee and thou shalt not turn thee from one side to another till thou hast ended the days of thy siege
take thou also unto thee wheat and barley and beans and lentiles and millet and fitches and put them in one vessel and make thee bread thereof according to the number of the days that thou shalt lie upon thy side three hundred and ninety days shalt thou eat thereof
and thy meat which thou shalt eat shall be by weight twenty shekels a day from time to time shalt thou eat it
thou shalt drink also water by measure the sixth part of an hin from time to time shalt thou drink
and thou shalt eat it as barley cakes and thou shalt bake it with dung that cometh out of man in their sight
and the lord said even thus shall the children of israel eat their defiled bread among the gentiles whither i will drive them
then said i ah lord god behold my soul hath not been polluted for from my youth up even till now have i not eaten of that which dieth of itself or is torn in pieces neither came there abominable flesh into my mouth
then he said unto me lo i have given thee cow's dung for man's dung and thou shalt prepare thy bread therewith
moreover he said unto me son of man behold i will break the staff of bread in jerusalem and they shall eat bread by weight and with care and they shall drink water by measure and with astonishment
that they may want bread and water and be astonied one with another and consume away for their iniquity
and thou son of man take thee a sharp knife take thee a barber's razor and cause it to pass upon thine head and upon thy beard then take thee balances to weigh and divide the hair
thou shalt burn with fire a third part in the midst of the city when the days of the siege are fulfilled and thou shalt take a third part and smite about it with a knife and a third part thou shalt scatter in the wind and i will draw out a sword after them
thou shalt also take thereof a few in number and bind them in thy skirts
then take of them again and cast them into the midst of the fire and burn them in the fire for thereof shall a fire come forth into all the house of israel
thus saith the lord god this is jerusalem i have set it in the midst of the nations and countries that are round about her
and she hath changed my judgments into wickedness more than the nations and my statutes more than the countries that are round about her for they have refused my judgments and my statutes they have not walked in them
therefore thus saith the lord god because ye multiplied more than the nations that are round about you and have not walked in my statutes neither have kept my judgments neither have done according to the judgments of the nations that are round about you
therefore thus saith the lord god behold i even i am against thee and will execute judgments in the midst of thee in the sight of the nations
and i will do in thee that which i have not done and whereunto i will not do any more the like because of all thine abominations
therefore the fathers shall eat the sons in the midst of thee and the sons shall eat their fathers and i will execute judgments in thee and the whole remnant of thee will i scatter into all the winds
wherefore as i live saith the lord god surely because thou hast defiled my sanctuary with all thy detestable things and with all thine abominations therefore will i also diminish thee neither shall mine eye spare neither will i have any pity
a third part of thee shall die with the pestilence and with famine shall they be consumed in the midst of thee and a third part shall fall by the sword round about thee and i will scatter a third part into all the winds and i will draw out a sword after them
thus shall mine anger be accomplished and i will cause my fury to rest upon them and i will be comforted and they shall know that i the lord have spoken it in my zeal when i have accomplished my fury in them
moreover i will make thee waste and a reproach among the nations that are round about thee in the sight of all that pass by
so it shall be a reproach and a taunt an instruction and an astonishment unto the nations that are round about thee when i shall execute judgments in thee in anger and in fury and in furious rebukes i the lord have spoken it
when i shall send upon them the evil arrows of famine which shall be for their destruction and which i will send to destroy you and i will increase the famine upon you and will break your staff of bread
so will i send upon you famine and evil beasts and they shall bereave thee and pestilence and blood shall pass through thee and i will bring the sword upon thee i the lord have spoken it
and the word of the lord came unto me saying
son of man set thy face toward the mountains of israel and prophesy against them
and say ye mountains of israel hear the word of the lord god thus saith the lord god to the mountains and to the hills to the rivers and to the valleys behold i even i will bring a sword upon you and i will destroy your high places
and your altars shall be desolate and your images shall be broken and i will cast down your slain men before your idols
and i will lay the dead carcases of the children of israel before their idols and i will scatter your bones round about your altars
in all your dwellingplaces the cities shall be laid waste and the high places shall be desolate that your altars may be laid waste and made desolate and your idols may be broken and cease and your images may be cut down and your works may be abolished
and the slain shall fall in the midst of you and ye shall know that i am the lord
yet will i leave a remnant that ye may have some that shall escape the sword among the nations when ye shall be scattered through the countries
and they that escape of you shall remember me among the nations whither they shall be carried captives because i am broken with their whorish heart which hath departed from me and with their eyes which go a whoring after their idols and they shall lothe themselves for the evils which they have committed in all their abominations
and they shall know that i am the lord and that i have not said in vain that i would do this evil unto them
thus saith the lord god smite with thine hand and stamp with thy foot and say alas for all the evil abominations of the house of israel for they shall fall by the sword by the famine and by the pestilence
he that is far off shall die of the pestilence and he that is near shall fall by the sword and he that remaineth and is besieged shall die by the famine thus will i accomplish my fury upon them
then shall ye know that i am the lord when their slain men shall be among their idols round about their altars upon every high hill in all the tops of the mountains and under every green tree and under every thick oak the place where they did offer sweet savour to all their idols
so will i stretch out my hand upon them and make the land desolate yea more desolate than the wilderness toward diblath in all their habitations and they shall know that i am the lord
moreover the word of the lord came unto me saying
also thou son of man thus saith the lord god unto the land of israel an end the end is come upon the four corners of the land
now is the end come upon thee and i will send mine anger upon thee and will judge thee according to thy ways and will recompense upon thee all thine abominations
and mine eye shall not spare thee neither will i have pity but i will recompense thy ways upon thee and thine abominations shall be in the midst of thee and ye shall know that i am the lord
thus saith the lord god an evil an only evil behold is come
an end is come the end is come it watcheth for thee behold it is come
the morning is come unto thee o thou that dwellest in the land the time is come the day of trouble is near and not the sounding again of the mountains
now will i shortly pour out my fury upon thee and accomplish mine anger upon thee and i will judge thee according to thy ways and will recompense thee for all thine abominations
and mine eye shall not spare neither will i have pity i will recompense thee according to thy ways and thine abominations that are in the midst of thee and ye shall know that i am the lord that smiteth
behold the day behold it is come the morning is gone forth the rod hath blossomed pride hath budded
violence is risen up into a rod of wickedness none of them shall remain nor of their multitude nor of any of theirs neither shall there be wailing for them
the time is come the day draweth near let not the buyer rejoice nor the seller mourn for wrath is upon all the multitude thereof
for the seller shall not return to that which is sold although they were yet alive for the vision is touching the whole multitude thereof which shall not return neither shall any strengthen himself in the iniquity of his life
they have blown the trumpet even to make all ready but none goeth to the battle for my wrath is upon all the multitude thereof
the sword is without and the pestilence and the famine within he that is in the field shall die with the sword and he that is in the city famine and pestilence shall devour him
but they that escape of them shall escape and shall be on the mountains like doves of the valleys all of them mourning every one for his iniquity
all hands shall be feeble and all knees shall be weak as water
they shall also gird themselves with sackcloth and horror shall cover them and shame shall be upon all faces and baldness upon all their heads
they shall cast their silver in the streets and their gold shall be removed their silver and their gold shall not be able to deliver them in the day of the wrath of the lord they shall not satisfy their souls neither fill their bowels because it is the stumblingblock of their iniquity
as for the beauty of his ornament he set it in majesty but they made the images of their abominations and of their detestable things therein therefore have i set it far from them
