mud not the fountain that gave drink to thee
mar not the thing that cannot be amended
end thy ill aim before thy shoot be ended
he is no woodman that doth bend his bow
to strike a poor unseasonable doe
'my husband is thy friend for his sake spare me
thyself art mighty for thine own sake leave me
myself a weakling do not then ensnare me
thou look'st not like deceit do not deceive me
my sighs like whirlwinds labour hence to heave thee
if ever man were moved with woman moans
be moved with my tears my sighs my groans
'all which together like a troubled ocean
beat at thy rocky and wreckthreatening heart
to soften it with their continual motion
for stones dissolved to water do convert
o if no harder than a stone thou art
melt at my tears and be compassionate
soft pity enters at an iron gate
'in tarquin's likeness i did entertain thee
hast thou put on his shape to do him shame
to all the host of heaven i complain me
thou wrong'st his honour wound'st his princely name
thou art not what thou seem'st and if the same
thou seem'st not what thou art a god a king
for kings like gods should govern everything
'how will thy shame be seeded in thine age
when thus thy vices bud before thy spring
if in thy hope thou darest do such outrage
what darest thou not when once thou art a king
o be remember'd no outrageous thing
from vassal actors can be wiped away
then kings misdeeds cannot be hid in clay
'this deed will make thee only loved for fear
but happy monarchs still are fear'd for love
with foul offenders thou perforce must bear
when they in thee the like offences prove
if but for fear of this thy will remove
for princes are the glass the school the book
where subjects eyes do learn do read do look
'and wilt thou be the school where lust shall learn
must he in thee read lectures of such shame
wilt thou be glass wherein it shall discern
authority for sin warrant for blame
to privilege dishonour in thy name
thou black'st reproach against longliving laud
and makest fair reputation but a bawd
'hast thou command by him that gave it thee
from a pure heart command thy rebel will
draw not thy sword to guard iniquity
for it was lent thee all that brood to kill
thy princely office how canst thou fulfil
when pattern'd by thy fault foul sin may say
he learn'd to sin and thou didst teach the way
'think but how vile a spectacle it were
to view thy present trespass in another
men's faults do seldom to themselves appear
their own transgressions partially they smother
this guilt would seem deathworthy in thy brother
o how are they wrapp'd in with infamies
that from their own misdeeds askance their eyes
'to thee to thee my heavedup hands appeal
not to seducing lust thy rash relier
i sue for exiled majesty's repeal
let him return and flattering thoughts retire
his true respect will prison false desire
and wipe the dim mist from thy doting eyne
that thou shalt see thy state and pity mine'
'have done quoth he my uncontrolled tide
turns not but swells the higher by this let
small lights are soon blown out huge fires abide
and with the wind in greater fury fret
the petty streams that pay a daily debt
to their salt sovereign with their fresh falls haste
add to his flow but alter not his taste'
'thou art quoth she a sea a sovereign king
and lo there falls into thy boundless flood
black lust dishonour shame misgoverning
who seek to stain the ocean of thy blood
if all these pretty ills shall change thy good
thy sea within a puddle's womb is hearsed
and not the puddle in thy sea dispersed
'so shall these slaves be king and thou their slave
thou nobly base they basely dignified
thou their fair life and they thy fouler grave
thou loathed in their shame they in thy pride
the lesser thing should not the greater hide
the cedar stoops not to the base shrub's foot
but low shrubs wither at the cedar's root
'so let thy thoughts low vassals to thy state'
no more quoth he by heaven i will not hear thee
yield to my love if not enforced hate
instead of love's coy touch shall rudely tear thee
that done despitefully i mean to bear thee
unto the base bed of some rascal groom
to be thy partner in this shameful doom'
this said he sets his foot upon the light
for light and lust are deadly enemies
shame folded up in blind concealing night
when most unseen then most doth tyrannize
the wolf hath seized his prey the poor lamb cries
till with her own white fleece her voice controll'd
entombs her outcry in her lips sweet fold
for with the nightly linen that she wears
he pens her piteous clamours in her head
cooling his hot face in the chastest tears
that ever modest eyes with sorrow shed
o that prone lust should stain so pure a bed
the spots whereof could weeping purify
her tears should drop on them perpetually
but she hath lost a dearer thing than life
and he hath won what he would lose again
this forced league doth force a further strife
this momentary joy breeds months of pain
this hot desire converts to cold disdain
pure chastity is rifled of her store
and lust the thief far poorer than before
look as the fullfed hound or gorged hawk
unapt for tender smell or speedy flight
make slow pursuit or altogether balk
the prey wherein by nature they delight
so surfeittaking tarquin fares this night
his taste delicious in digestion souring
devours his will that lived by foul devouring
o deeper sin than bottomless conceit
can comprehend in still imagination
drunken desire must vomit his receipt
ere he can see his own abomination
while lust is in his pride no exclamation
can curb his heat or rein his rash desire
till like a jade selfwill himself doth tire
and then with lank and lean discolour'd cheek
with heavy eye knit brow and strengthless pace
feeble desire all recreant poor and meek
like to a bankrupt beggar wails his case
the flesh being proud desire doth fight with grace
for there it revels and when that decays
the guilty rebel for remission prays
so fares it with this faultful lord of rome
who this accomplishment so hotly chased
for now against himself he sounds this doom
that through the length of times he stands disgraced
besides his soul's fair temple is defaced
to whose weak ruins muster troops of cares
to ask the spotted princess how she fares
she says her subjects with foul insurrection
have batter'd down her consecrated wall
and by their mortal fault brought in subjection
her immortality and made her thrall
to living death and pain perpetual
which in her prescience she controlled still
but her foresight could not forestall their will
even in this thought through the dark night he stealeth
a captive victor that hath lost in gain
bearing away the wound that nothing healeth
the scar that will despite of cure remain
leaving his spoil perplex'd in greater pain
she bears the load of lust he left behind
and he the burden of a guilty mind
he like a thievish dog creeps sadly thence
she like a wearied lamb lies panting there
he scowls and hates himself for his offence
she desperate with her nails her flesh doth tear
he faintly flies sneaking with guilty fear
she stays exclaiming on the direful night
he runs and chides his vanish'd loathed delight
he thence departs a heavy convertite
she there remains a hopeless castaway
he in his speed looks for the morning light
she prays she never may behold the day
'for day quoth she nights scapes doth open lay
and my true eyes have never practised how
to cloak offences with a cunning brow
'they think not but that every eye can see
the same disgrace which they themselves behold
and therefore would they still in darkness be
to have their unseen sin remain untold
for they their guilt with weeping will unfold
and grave like water that doth eat in steel
upon my cheeks what helpless shame i feel'
here she exclaims against repose and rest
and bids her eyes hereafter still be blind
she wakes her heart by beating on her breast
and bids it leap from thence where it may find
some purer chest to close so pure a mind
frantic with grief thus breathes she forth her spite
against the unseen secrecy of night
'o comfortkilling night image of hell
dim register and notary of shame
black stage for tragedies and murders fell
vast sinconcealing chaos nurse of blame
blind muffled bawd dark harbour for defame
grim cave of death whispering conspirator
with closetongued treason and the ravisher
'o hateful vaporous and foggy night
since thou art guilty of my cureless crime
muster thy mists to meet the eastern light
make war against proportion'd course of time
or if thou wilt permit the sun to climb
his wonted height yet ere he go to bed
