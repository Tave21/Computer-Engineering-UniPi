 doth flourish the deceit come let us go

 good favour you have but that you have a hanging
 lookdo you call sir your occupation a mystery
abhorson ay sir a mystery
pompey painting sir i have heard say is a mystery and
 your whores sir being members of my occupation
 using painting do prove my occupation a mystery
 but what mystery there should be in hanging if i
 should be hanged i cannot imagine
abhorson sir it is a mystery
pompey proof
abhorson every true man's apparel fits your thief if it be
 too little for your thief your true man thinks it
 big enough if it be too big for your thief your
 thief thinks it little enough so every true man's
 apparel fits your thief
 reenter provost
provost are you agreed

 a more penitent trade than your bawd he doth
 oftener ask forgiveness

pompey i do desire to learn sir and i hope if you have
 occasion to use me for your own turn you shall find

 the one has my pity not a jot the other
 being a murderer though he were my brother
 enter claudio
 look here's the warrant claudio for thy death
 tis now dead midnight and by eight tomorrow
 thou must be made immortal where's barnardine
claudio as fast lock'd up in sleep as guiltless labour
 when it lies starkly in the traveller's bones
 he will not wake
provost who can do good on him
 well go prepare yourself
 knocking within
 but hark what noise
 heaven give your spirits comfort
 exit claudio
 by and by
 i hope it is some pardon or reprieve
 for the most gentle claudio
 enter duke vincentio disguised as before
 welcome father
duke vincentio the best and wholesomest spirts of the night
 envelope you good provost who call'd here of late
provost none since the curfew rung
duke vincentio not isabel
provost no
duke vincentio they will then ere't be long
provost what comfort is for claudio
duke vincentio there's some in hope
provost it is a bitter deputy
duke vincentio not so not so his life is parallel'd
 even with the stroke and line of his great justice
 he doth with holy abstinence subdue
 that in himself which he spurs on his power
 to qualify in others were he meal'd with that
 which he corrects then were he tyrannous
 but this being so he's just
 knocking within
 now are they come
 exit provost
 this is a gentle provost seldom when
 the steeled gaoler is the friend of men
 knocking within
 how now what noise that spirit's possessed with haste
 that wounds the unsisting postern with these strokes
 reenter provost
provost there he must stay until the officer
 arise to let him in he is call'd up
duke vincentio have you no countermand for claudio yet
 but he must die tomorrow
provost none sir none
duke vincentio as near the dawning provost as it is
 you shall hear more ere morning
provost happily
 you something know yet i believe there comes
 no countermand no such example have we
 besides upon the very siege of justice
 lord angelo hath to the public ear
 profess'd the contrary
 enter a messenger
 this is his lordship's man
duke vincentio and here comes claudio's pardon
messenger giving a paper
 my lord hath sent you this note and by me this
 further charge that you swerve not from the
 smallest article of it neither in time matter or
 other circumstance good morrow for as i take it
 it is almost day
provost i shall obey him
 exit messenger
duke vincentio aside this is his pardon purchased by such sin
 for which the pardoner himself is in
 hence hath offence his quick celerity
 when it is born in high authority
 when vice makes mercy mercy's so extended
 that for the fault's love is the offender friended
 now sir what news
provost i told you lord angelo belike thinking me remiss
 in mine office awakens me with this unwonted
 puttingon methinks strangely for he hath not used it before
duke vincentio pray you let's hear
provost reads
 whatsoever you may hear to the contrary let
 claudio be executed by four of the clock and in the
 afternoon barnardine for my better satisfaction
 let me have claudio's head sent me by five let
 this be duly performed with a thought that more
 depends on it than we must yet deliver thus fail
 not to do your office as you will answer it at your peril'
 what say you to this sir
duke vincentio what is that barnardine who is to be executed in the
 afternoon
provost a bohemian born but here nursed un and bred one
 that is a prisoner nine years old
duke vincentio how came it that the absent duke had not either
 delivered him to his liberty or executed him i
 have heard it was ever his manner to do so
provost his friends still wrought reprieves for him and
 indeed his fact till now in the government of lord
 angelo came not to an undoubtful proof
duke vincentio it is now apparent
provost most manifest and not denied by himself
duke vincentio hath he born himself penitently in prison how
 seems he to be touched
provost a man that apprehends death no more dreadfully but
 as a drunken sleep careless reckless and fearless
 of what's past present or to come insensible of
 mortality and desperately mortal
duke vincentio he wants advice
provost he will hear none he hath evermore had the liberty
 of the prison give him leave to escape hence he
 would not drunk many times a day if not many days
 entirely drunk we have very oft awaked him as if
 to carry him to execution and showed him a seeming
 warrant for it it hath not moved him at all
duke vincentio more of him anon there is written in your brow
 provost honesty and constancy if i read it not
 truly my ancient skill beguiles me but in the
 boldness of my cunning i will lay myself in hazard
 claudio whom here you have warrant to execute is
 no greater forfeit to the law than angelo who hath
 sentenced him to make you understand this in a
 manifested effect i crave but four days respite
