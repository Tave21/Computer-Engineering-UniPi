 though i say it is an honest exceeding poor man
 and god be thanked well to live
launcelot well let his father be what a will we talk of
 young master launcelot
gobbo your worship's friend and launcelot sir
launcelot but i pray you ergo old man ergo i beseech you
 talk you of young master launcelot
gobbo of launcelot an't please your mastership
launcelot ergo master launcelot talk not of master
 launcelot father for the young gentleman
 according to fates and destinies and such odd
 sayings the sisters three and such branches of
 learning is indeed deceased or as you would say
 in plain terms gone to heaven
gobbo marry god forbid the boy was the very staff of my
 age my very prop
launcelot do i look like a cudgel or a hovelpost a staff or
 a prop do you know me father
gobbo alack the day i know you not young gentleman

 the knowing me it is a wise father that knows his
 own child well old man i will tell you news of
 your son give me your blessing truth will come
 to light murder cannot be hid long a man's son
 may but at the length truth will out
gobbo pray you sir stand up i am sure you are not

launcelot pray you let's have no more fooling about it but
 give me your blessing i am launcelot your boy
 that was your son that is your child that shall
 be

launcelot i know not what i shall think of that but i am
 launcelot the jew's man and i am sure margery your
 wife is my mother
gobbo her name is margery indeed i'll be sworn if thou
 be launcelot thou art mine own flesh and blood
 lord worshipped might he be what a beard hast thou
 got thou hast got more hair on thy chin than
 dobbin my fillhorse has on his tail
launcelot it should seem then that dobbin's tail grows
 backward i am sure he had more hair of his tail
 than i have of my face when i last saw him
gobbo lord how art thou changed how dost thou and thy
 master agree i have brought him a present how
 gree you now
launcelot well well but for mine own part as i have set
 up my rest to run away so i will not rest till i

 him a present give him a halter i am famished in
 his service you may tell every finger i have with
 my ribs father i am glad you are come give me
 your present to one master bassanio who indeed
 gives rare new liveries if i serve not him i
 will run as far as god has any ground o rare
 fortune here comes the man to him father for i
 am a jew if i serve the jew any longer

 would sir as my father shall specify
gobbo he hath a great infection sir as one would say to serve
launcelot indeed the short and the long is i serve the jew
 and have a desire as my father shall specify
gobbo his master and he saving your worship's reverence
 are scarce catercousins
launcelot to be brief the very truth is that the jew having
 done me wrong doth cause me as my father being i
 hope an old man shall frutify unto you
gobbo i have here a dish of doves that i would bestow upon
 your worship and my suit is
launcelot in very brief the suit is impertinent to myself as
 your worship shall know by this honest old man and
 though i say it though old man yet poor man my father
bassanio one speak for both what would you
launcelot serve you sir
gobbo that is the very defect of the matter sir
bassanio i know thee well thou hast obtain'd thy suit
 shylock thy master spoke with me this day
 and hath preferr'd thee if it be preferment
 to leave a rich jew's service to become
 the follower of so poor a gentleman
launcelot the old proverb is very well parted between my
 master shylock and you sir you have the grace of
 god sir and he hath enough
bassanio thou speak'st it well go father with thy son
 take leave of thy old master and inquire
 my lodging out give him a livery
 more guarded than his fellows see it done
launcelot father in i cannot get a service no i have
 ne'er a tongue in my head well if any man in
 italy have a fairer table which doth offer to swear
 upon a book i shall have good fortune go to
 here's a simple line of life here's a small trifle
 of wives alas fifteen wives is nothing eleven
 widows and nine maids is a simple comingin for one
 man and then to scape drowning thrice and to be
 in peril of my life with the edge of a featherbed
 here are simple scapes well if fortune be a
 woman she's a good wench for this gear father
 come i'll take my leave of the jew in the twinkling of an eye
 exeunt launcelot and old gobbo
bassanio i pray thee good leonardo think on this
 these things being bought and orderly bestow'd

leonardo yonder sir he walks

gratiano signior bassanio
bassanio gratiano
gratiano i have a suit to you
bassanio you have obtain'd it
gratiano you must not deny me i must go with you to belmont
bassanio why then you must but hear thee gratiano
 thou art too wild too rude and bold of voice
 parts that become thee happily enough
 and in such eyes as ours appear not faults
 but where thou art not known why there they show
 something too liberal pray thee take pain
 to allay with some cold drops of modesty
 thy skipping spirit lest through thy wild behavior
 i be misconstrued in the place i go to
 and lose my hopes
gratiano signior bassanio hear me
 if i do not put on a sober habit
 talk with respect and swear but now and then
 wear prayerbooks in my pocket look demurely
 nay more while grace is saying hood mine eyes
 thus with my hat and sigh and say amen'
 use all the observance of civility
 like one well studied in a sad ostent
 to please his grandam never trust me more
bassanio well we shall see your bearing
gratiano nay but i bar tonight you shall not gauge me
 by what we do tonight
bassanio no that were pity
 i would entreat you rather to put on
 your boldest suit of mirth for we have friends
 that purpose merriment but fare you well
 i have some business
gratiano and i must to lorenzo and the rest
 but we will visit you at suppertime

 pagan most sweet jew if a christian did not play
 the knave and get thee i am much deceived but
 adieu these foolish drops do something drown my
 manly spirit adieu
jessica farewell good launcelot

 to be ashamed to be my father's child
 but though i am a daughter to his blood
