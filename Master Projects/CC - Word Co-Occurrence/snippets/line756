 from sun to sun there is my honour's pawn
 engage it to the trial if thou darest
duke of aumerle who sets me else by heaven i'll throw at all
 i have a thousand spirits in one breast
 to answer twenty thousand such as you
duke of surrey my lord fitzwater i do remember well
 the very time aumerle and you did talk
lord fitzwater tis very true you were in presence then
 and you can witness with me this is true
duke of surrey as false by heaven as heaven itself is true
lord fitzwater surrey thou liest
duke of surrey dishonourable boy
 that lie shall lie so heavy on my sword
 that it shall render vengeance and revenge
 till thou the liegiver and that lie do lie
 in earth as quiet as thy father's skull
 in proof whereof there is my honour's pawn
 engage it to the trial if thou darest
lord fitzwater how fondly dost thou spur a forward horse
 if i dare eat or drink or breathe or live
 i dare meet surrey in a wilderness
 and spit upon him whilst i say he lies
 and lies and lies there is my bond of faith
 to tie thee to my strong correction
 as i intend to thrive in this new world
 aumerle is guilty of my true appeal
 besides i heard the banish'd norfolk say
 that thou aumerle didst send two of thy men
 to execute the noble duke at calais
duke of aumerle some honest christian trust me with a gage
 that norfolk lies here do i throw down this
 if he may be repeal'd to try his honour
henry bolingbroke these differences shall all rest under gage
 till norfolk be repeal'd repeal'd he shall be
 and though mine enemy restored again
 to all his lands and signories when he's return'd
 against aumerle we will enforce his trial
bishop of carlisle that honourable day shall ne'er be seen
 many a time hath banish'd norfolk fought
 for jesu christ in glorious christian field
 streaming the ensign of the christian cross
 against black pagans turks and saracens
 and toil'd with works of war retired himself
 to italy and there at venice gave
 his body to that pleasant country's earth
 and his pure soul unto his captain christ
 under whose colours he had fought so long
henry bolingbroke why bishop is norfolk dead
bishop of carlisle as surely as i live my lord
henry bolingbroke sweet peace conduct his sweet soul to the bosom
 of good old abraham lords appellants
 your differences shall all rest under gage
 till we assign you to your days of trial
 enter duke of york attended
duke of york great duke of lancaster i come to thee
 from plumepluck'd richard who with willing soul
 adopts thee heir and his high sceptre yields
 to the possession of thy royal hand
 ascend his throne descending now from him
 and long live henry fourth of that name
henry bolingbroke in god's name i'll ascend the regal throne
bishop of carlisle marry god forbid
 worst in this royal presence may i speak
 yet best beseeming me to speak the truth
 would god that any in this noble presence
 were enough noble to be upright judge
 of noble richard then true noblesse would
 learn him forbearance from so foul a wrong
 what subject can give sentence on his king
 and who sits here that is not richard's subject
 thieves are not judged but they are by to hear
 although apparent guilt be seen in them
 and shall the figure of god's majesty
 his captain steward deputyelect
 anointed crowned planted many years
 be judged by subject and inferior breath
 and he himself not present o forfend it god
 that in a christian climate souls refined
 should show so heinous black obscene a deed
 i speak to subjects and a subject speaks
 stirr'd up by god thus boldly for his king
 my lord of hereford here whom you call king
 is a foul traitor to proud hereford's king
 and if you crown him let me prophesy
 the blood of english shall manure the ground
 and future ages groan for this foul act
 peace shall go sleep with turks and infidels
 and in this seat of peace tumultuous wars
 shall kin with kin and kind with kind confound
 disorder horror fear and mutiny
 shall here inhabit and this land be call'd
 the field of golgotha and dead men's skulls
 o if you raise this house against this house
 it will the woefullest division prove
 that ever fell upon this cursed earth
 prevent it resist it let it not be so
 lest child child's children cry against you woe
northumberland well have you argued sir and for your pains
 of capital treason we arrest you here
 my lord of westminster be it your charge
 to keep him safely till his day of trial
 may it please you lords to grant the commons suit
henry bolingbroke fetch hither richard that in common view
 he may surrender so we shall proceed
 without suspicion
duke of york i will be his conduct
 exit
henry bolingbroke lords you that here are under our arrest
 procure your sureties for your days of answer
 little are we beholding to your love
 and little look'd for at your helping hands
 reenter duke of york with king richard ii and
 officers bearing the regalia
king richard ii alack why am i sent for to a king
 before i have shook off the regal thoughts
 wherewith i reign'd i hardly yet have learn'd
 to insinuate flatter bow and bend my limbs
 give sorrow leave awhile to tutor me
 to this submission yet i well remember
 the favours of these men were they not mine
 did they not sometime cry all hail to me
 so judas did to christ but he in twelve
 found truth in all but one i in twelve thousand none
 god save the king will no man say amen
 am i both priest and clerk well then amen
 god save the king although i be not he
 and yet amen if heaven do think him me
 to do what service am i sent for hither
duke of york to do that office of thine own good will
 which tired majesty did make thee offer
 the resignation of thy state and crown
 to henry bolingbroke
king richard ii give me the crown here cousin seize the crown
 here cousin
 on this side my hand and on that side yours
 now is this golden crown like a deep well
 that owes two buckets filling one another
 the emptier ever dancing in the air
 the other down unseen and full of water
 that bucket down and full of tears am i
 drinking my griefs whilst you mount up on high
henry bolingbroke i thought you had been willing to resign
king richard ii my crown i am but still my griefs are mine
 you may my glories and my state depose
 but not my griefs still am i king of those
henry bolingbroke part of your cares you give me with your crown
king richard ii your cares set up do not pluck my cares down
 my care is loss of care by old care done
 your care is gain of care by new care won
 the cares i give i have though given away
 they tend the crown yet still with me they stay
henry bolingbroke are you contented to resign the crown
king richard ii ay no no ay for i must nothing be
 therefore no no for i resign to thee
 now mark me how i will undo myself
 i give this heavy weight from off my head
 and this unwieldy sceptre from my hand
 the pride of kingly sway from out my heart
 with mine own tears i wash away my balm
 with mine own hands i give away my crown
 with mine own tongue deny my sacred state
 with mine own breath release all duty's rites
 all pomp and majesty i do forswear
 my manors rents revenues i forego
 my acts decrees and statutes i deny
 god pardon all oaths that are broke to me
 god keep all vows unbroke that swear to thee
 make me that nothing have with nothing grieved
 and thou with all pleased that hast all achieved
 long mayst thou live in richard's seat to sit
 and soon lie richard in an earthly pit
 god save king harry unking'd richard says
 and send him many years of sunshine days
 what more remains
northumberland no more but that you read
 these accusations and these grievous crimes
 committed by your person and your followers
 against the state and profit of this land
 that by confessing them the souls of men
 may deem that you are worthily deposed
king richard ii must i do so and must i ravel out
 my weavedup folly gentle northumberland
 if thy offences were upon record
 would it not shame thee in so fair a troop
 to read a lecture of them if thou wouldst
 there shouldst thou find one heinous article
 containing the deposing of a king
 and cracking the strong warrant of an oath
 mark'd with a blot damn'd in the book of heaven
 nay all of you that stand and look upon
 whilst that my wretchedness doth bait myself
 though some of you with pilate wash your hands
 showing an outward pity yet you pilates
 have here deliver'd me to my sour cross
 and water cannot wash away your sin
northumberland my lord dispatch read o'er these articles
king richard ii mine eyes are full of tears i cannot see
 and yet salt water blinds them not so much
 but they can see a sort of traitors here
 nay if i turn mine eyes upon myself
