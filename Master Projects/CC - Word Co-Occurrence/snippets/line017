and the lord spake unto moses in mount sinai saying
speak unto the children of israel and say unto them when ye come into the land which i give you then shall the land keep a sabbath unto the lord
six years thou shalt sow thy field and six years thou shalt prune thy vineyard and gather in the fruit thereof
but in the seventh year shall be a sabbath of rest unto the land a sabbath for the lord thou shalt neither sow thy field nor prune thy vineyard
that which groweth of its own accord of thy harvest thou shalt not reap neither gather the grapes of thy vine undressed for it is a year of rest unto the land
and the sabbath of the land shall be meat for you for thee and for thy servant and for thy maid and for thy hired servant and for thy stranger that sojourneth with thee
and for thy cattle and for the beast that are in thy land shall all the increase thereof be meat
and thou shalt number seven sabbaths of years unto thee seven times seven years and the space of the seven sabbaths of years shall be unto thee forty and nine years

a jubile shall that fiftieth year be unto you ye shall not sow neither reap that which groweth of itself in it nor gather the grapes in it of thy vine undressed
for it is the jubile it shall be holy unto you ye shall eat the increase thereof out of the field
in the year of this jubile ye shall return every man unto his possession
and if thou sell ought unto thy neighbour or buyest ought of thy neighbour's hand ye shall not oppress one another
according to the number of years after the jubile thou shalt buy of thy neighbour and according unto the number of years of the fruits he shall sell unto thee
according to the multitude of years thou shalt increase the price thereof and according to the fewness of years thou shalt diminish the price of it for according to the number of the years of the fruits doth he sell unto thee
ye shall not therefore oppress one another but thou shalt fear thy godfor i am the lord your god
wherefore ye shall do my statutes and keep my judgments and do them and ye shall dwell in the land in safety
and the land shall yield her fruit and ye shall eat your fill and dwell therein in safety
and if ye shall say what shall we eat the seventh year behold we shall not sow nor gather in our increase
then i will command my blessing upon you in the sixth year and it shall bring forth fruit for three years
and ye shall sow the eighth year and eat yet of old fruit until the ninth year until her fruits come in ye shall eat of the old store
the land shall not be sold for ever for the land is mine for ye are strangers and sojourners with me
and in all the land of your possession ye shall grant a redemption for the land
if thy brother be waxen poor and hath sold away some of his possession and if any of his kin come to redeem it then shall he redeem that which his brother sold
and if the man have none to redeem it and himself be able to redeem it
then let him count the years of the sale thereof and restore the overplus unto the man to whom he sold it that he may return unto his possession
but if he be not able to restore it to him then that which is sold shall remain in the hand of him that hath bought it until the year of jubile and in the jubile it shall go out and he shall return unto his possession
and if a man sell a dwelling house in a walled city then he may redeem it within a whole year after it is sold within a full year may he redeem it
and if it be not redeemed within the space of a full year then the house that is in the walled city shall be established for ever to him that bought it throughout his generations it shall not go out in the jubile
but the houses of the villages which have no wall round about them shall be counted as the fields of the country they may be redeemed and they shall go out in the jubile
notwithstanding the cities of the levites and the houses of the cities of their possession may the levites redeem at any time
and if a man purchase of the levites then the house that was sold and the city of his possession shall go out in the year of jubile for the houses of the cities of the levites are their possession among the children of israel
but the field of the suburbs of their cities may not be sold for it is their perpetual possession
and if thy brother be waxen poor and fallen in decay with thee then thou shalt relieve him yea though he be a stranger or a sojourner that he may live with thee
take thou no usury of him or increase but fear thy god that thy brother may live with thee
thou shalt not give him thy money upon usury nor lend him thy victuals for increase
i am the lord your god which brought you forth out of the land of egypt to give you the land of canaan and to be your god
and if thy brother that dwelleth by thee be waxen poor and be sold unto thee thou shalt not compel him to serve as a bondservant
but as an hired servant and as a sojourner he shall be with thee and shall serve thee unto the year of jubile
and then shall he depart from thee both he and his children with him and shall return unto his own family and unto the possession of his fathers shall he return
for they are my servants which i brought forth out of the land of egypt they shall not be sold as bondmen
thou shalt not rule over him with rigour but shalt fear thy god
both thy bondmen and thy bondmaids which thou shalt have shall be of the heathen that are round about you of them shall ye buy bondmen and bondmaids
moreover of the children of the strangers that do sojourn among you of them shall ye buy and of their families that are with you which they begat in your land and they shall be your possession
and ye shall take them as an inheritance for your children after you to inherit them for a possession they shall be your bondmen for ever but over your brethren the children of israel ye shall not rule one over another with rigour
and if a sojourner or stranger wax rich by thee and thy brother that dwelleth by him wax poor and sell himself unto the stranger or sojourner by thee or to the stock of the stranger's family
after that he is sold he may be redeemed again one of his brethren may redeem him
either his uncle or his uncle's son may redeem him or any that is nigh of kin unto him of his family may redeem him or if he be able he may redeem himself
and he shall reckon with him that bought him from the year that he was sold to him unto the year of jubile and the price of his sale shall be according unto the number of years according to the time of an hired servant shall it be with him
if there be yet many years behind according unto them he shall give again the price of his redemption out of the money that he was bought for
and if there remain but few years unto the year of jubile then he shall count with him and according unto his years shall he give him again the price of his redemption
and as a yearly hired servant shall he be with him and the other shall not rule with rigour over him in thy sight
and if he be not redeemed in these years then he shall go out in the year of jubile both he and his children with him
for unto me the children of israel are servants they are my servants whom i brought forth out of the land of egypt i am the lord your god
ye shall make you no idols nor graven image neither rear you up a standing image neither shall ye set up any image of stone in your land to bow down unto it for i am the lord your god
ye shall keep my sabbaths and reverence my sanctuary i am the lord
if ye walk in my statutes and keep my commandments and do them
then i will give you rain in due season and the land shall yield her increase and the trees of the field shall yield their fruit
and your threshing shall reach unto the vintage and the vintage shall reach unto the sowing time and ye shall eat your bread to the full and dwell in your land safely
and i will give peace in the land and ye shall lie down and none shall make you afraid and i will rid evil beasts out of the land neither shall the sword go through your land
and ye shall chase your enemies and they shall fall before you by the sword
and five of you shall chase an hundred and an hundred of you shall put ten thousand to flight and your enemies shall fall before you by the sword
for i will have respect unto you and make you fruitful and multiply you and establish my covenant with you
and ye shall eat old store and bring forth the old because of the new
and i will set my tabernacle among you and my soul shall not abhor you
and i will walk among you and will be your god and ye shall be my people
i am the lord your god which brought you forth out of the land of egypt that ye should not be their bondmen and i have broken the bands of your yoke and made you go upright
but if ye will not hearken unto me and will not do all these commandments
and if ye shall despise my statutes or if your soul abhor my judgments so that ye will not do all my commandments but that ye break my covenant
i also will do this unto you i will even appoint over you terror consumption and the burning ague that shall consume the eyes and cause sorrow of heart and ye shall sow your seed in vain for your enemies shall eat it
and i will set my face against you and ye shall be slain before your enemies they that hate you shall reign over you and ye shall flee when none pursueth you
and if ye will not yet for all this hearken unto me then i will punish you seven times more for your sins
and i will break the pride of your power and i will make your heaven as iron and your earth as brass
and your strength shall be spent in vain for your land shall not yield her increase neither shall the trees of the land yield their fruits
and if ye walk contrary unto me and will not hearken unto me i will bring seven times more plagues upon you according to your sins
i will also send wild beasts among you which shall rob you of your children and destroy your cattle and make you few in number and your high ways shall be desolate
and if ye will not be reformed by me by these things but will walk contrary unto me
then will i also walk contrary unto you and will punish you yet seven times for your sins
and i will bring a sword upon you that shall avenge the quarrel of my covenant and when ye are gathered together within your cities i will send the pestilence among you and ye shall be delivered into the hand of the enemy
and when i have broken the staff of your bread ten women shall bake your bread in one oven and they shall deliver you your bread again by weight and ye shall eat and not be satisfied
and if ye will not for all this hearken unto me but walk contrary unto me
then i will walk contrary unto you also in fury and i even i will chastise you seven times for your sins
and ye shall eat the flesh of your sons and the flesh of your daughters shall ye eat
and i will destroy your high places and cut down your images and cast your carcases upon the carcases of your idols and my soul shall abhor you
and i will make your cities waste and bring your sanctuaries unto desolation and i will not smell the savour of your sweet odours
and i will bring the land into desolation and your enemies which dwell therein shall be astonished at it
and i will scatter you among the heathen and will draw out a sword after you and your land shall be desolate and your cities waste
then shall the land enjoy her sabbaths as long as it lieth desolate and ye be in your enemies land even then shall the land rest and enjoy her sabbaths
as long as it lieth desolate it shall rest because it did not rest in your sabbaths when ye dwelt upon it
and upon them that are left alive of you i will send a faintness into their hearts in the lands of their enemies and the sound of a shaken leaf shall chase them and they shall flee as fleeing from a sword and they shall fall when none pursueth
and they shall fall one upon another as it were before a sword when none pursueth and ye shall have no power to stand before your enemies
and ye shall perish among the heathen and the land of your enemies shall eat you up
and they that are left of you shall pine away in their iniquity in your enemies lands and also in the iniquities of their fathers shall they pine away with them
if they shall confess their iniquity and the iniquity of their fathers with their trespass which they trespassed against me and that also they have walked contrary unto me
and that i also have walked contrary unto them and have brought them into the land of their enemies if then their uncircumcised hearts be humbled and they then accept of the punishment of their iniquity
then will i remember my covenant with jacob and also my covenant with isaac and also my covenant with abraham will i remember and i will remember the land
the land also shall be left of them and shall enjoy her sabbaths while she lieth desolate without them and they shall accept of the punishment of their iniquity because even because they despised my judgments and because their soul abhorred my statutes
and yet for all that when they be in the land of their enemies i will not cast them away neither will i abhor them to destroy them utterly and to break my covenant with them for i am the lord their god
but i will for their sakes remember the covenant of their ancestors whom i brought forth out of the land of egypt in the sight of the heathen that i might be their god i am the lord
these are the statutes and judgments and laws which the lord made between him and the children of israel in mount sinai by the hand of moses
and the lord spake unto moses saying
speak unto the children of israel and say unto them when a man shall make a singular vow the persons shall be for the lord by thy estimation

and if it be from a month old even unto five years old then thy estimation shall be of the male five shekels of silver and for the female thy estimation shall be three shekels of silver
and if it be from sixty years old and above if it be a male then thy estimation shall be fifteen shekels and for the female ten shekels
but if he be poorer than thy estimation then he shall present himself before the priest and the priest shall value him according to his ability that vowed shall the priest value him
and if it be a beast whereof men bring an offering unto the lord all that any man giveth of such unto the lord shall be holy
he shall not alter it nor change it a good for a bad or a bad for a good and if he shall at all change beast for beast then it and the exchange thereof shall be holy
and if it be any unclean beast of which they do not offer a sacrifice unto the lord then he shall present the beast before the priest
and the priest shall value it whether it be good or bad as thou valuest it who art the priest so shall it be
but if he will at all redeem it then he shall add a fifth part thereof unto thy estimation
and when a man shall sanctify his house to be holy unto the lord then the priest shall estimate it whether it be good or bad as the priest shall estimate it so shall it stand
and if he that sanctified it will redeem his house then he shall add the fifth part of the money of thy estimation unto it and it shall be his
and if a man shall sanctify unto the lord some part of a field of his possession then thy estimation shall be according to the seed thereof an homer of barley seed shall be valued at fifty shekels of silver
if he sanctify his field from the year of jubile according to thy estimation it shall stand
but if he sanctify his field after the jubile then the priest shall reckon unto him the money according to the years that remain even unto the year of the jubile and it shall be abated from thy estimation
and if he that sanctified the field will in any wise redeem it then he shall add the fifth part of the money of thy estimation unto it and it shall be assured to him
and if he will not redeem the field or if he have sold the field to another man it shall not be redeemed any more
but the field when it goeth out in the jubile shall be holy unto the lord as a field devoted the possession thereof shall be the priest's
and if a man sanctify unto the lord a field which he hath bought which is not of the fields of his possession
then the priest shall reckon unto him the worth of thy estimation even unto the year of the jubile and he shall give thine estimation in that day as a holy thing unto the lord
in the year of the jubile the field shall return unto him of whom it was bought even to him to whom the possession of the land did belong
and all thy estimations shall be according to the shekel of the sanctuary twenty gerahs shall be the shekel
only the firstling of the beasts which should be the lord's firstling no man shall sanctify it whether it be ox or sheep it is the lord's
and if it be of an unclean beast then he shall redeem it according to thine estimation and shall add a fifth part of it thereto or if it be not redeemed then it shall be sold according to thy estimation
