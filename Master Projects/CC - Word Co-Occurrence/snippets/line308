 so much i love his heart but i perceive
 men must learn now with pity to dispense
 for policy sits above conscience
 exeunt
 timon of athens
act iii
scene iii a room in sempronius house
 enter sempronius and a servant of timon's
sempronius must he needs trouble me in thum'bove
 all others
 he might have tried lord lucius or lucullus
 and now ventidius is wealthy too
 whom he redeem'd from prison all these
 owe their estates unto him
servant my lord
 they have all been touch'd and found base metal for
 they have au denied him
sempronius how have they denied him
 has ventidius and lucullus denied him
 and does he send to me three hum
 it shows but little love or judgment in him
 must i be his last refuge his friends like
 physicians
 thrive give him over must i take the cure upon me
 has much disgraced me in't i'm angry at him
 that might have known my place i see no sense for't
 but his occasion might have woo'd me first
 for in my conscience i was the first man
 that e'er received gift from him
 and does he think so backwardly of me now
 that i'll requite its last no
 so it may prove an argument of laughter
 to the rest and mongst lords i be thought a fool
 i'ld rather than the worth of thrice the sum
 had sent to me first but for my mind's sake
 i'd such a courage to do him good but now return
 and with their faint reply this answer join
 who bates mine honour shall not know my coin
 exit
servant excellent your lordship's a goodly villain the
 devil knew not what he did when he made man
 politic he crossed himself by t and i cannot
 think but in the end the villainies of man will
 set him clear how fairly this lord strives to
 appear foul takes virtuous copies to be wicked
 like those that under hot ardent zeal would set
 whole realms on fire of such a nature is his
 politic love
 this was my lord's best hope now all are fled
 save only the gods now his friends are dead
 doors that were ne'er acquainted with their wards
 many a bounteous year must be employ'd
 now to guard sure their master
 and this is all a liberal course allows
 who cannot keep his wealth must keep his house
 exit
 timon of athens
act iii
scene iv the same a hall in timon's house
 enter two servants of varro and the servant of
 lucius meeting titus hortensius and other
 servants of timon's creditors waiting his coming out
varro's
first servant well met good morrow titus and hortensius
titus the like to you kind varro
hortensius lucius
 what do we meet together
lucilius servant ay and i think
 one business does command us all for mine is money
titus so is theirs and ours
 enter philotus
lucilius servant and sir philotus too
philotus good day at once
lucilius servant welcome good brother
 what do you think the hour
philotus labouring for nine
lucilius servant so much
philotus is not my lord seen yet
lucilius servant not yet
philotus i wonder on't he was wont to shine at seven
lucilius servant ay but the days are wax'd shorter with him
 you must consider that a prodigal course
 is like the sun's but not like his recoverable
 i fear tis deepest winter in lord timon's purse
 that is one may reach deep enough and yet
 find little
philotus i am of your fear for that
titus i'll show you how to observe a strange event
 your lord sends now for money
hortensius most true he does
titus and he wears jewels now of timon's gift
 for which i wait for money
hortensius it is against my heart
lucilius servant mark how strange it shows
 timon in this should pay more than he owes
 and e'en as if your lord should wear rich jewels
 and send for money for em
hortensius i'm weary of this charge the gods can witness
 i know my lord hath spent of timon's wealth
 and now ingratitude makes it worse than stealth
varro's
first servant yes mine's three thousand crowns what's yours
lucilius servant five thousand mine
varro's
first servant tis much deep and it should seem by the sun
 your master's confidence was above mine
 else surely his had equall'd
 enter flaminius
titus one of lord timon's men
lucilius servant flaminius sir a word pray is my lord ready to
 come forth
flaminius no indeed he is not
titus we attend his lordship pray signify so much
flaminius i need not tell him that he knows you are too diligent
 exit
 enter flavius in a cloak muffled
lucilius servant ha is not that his steward muffled so
 he goes away in a cloud call him call him
titus do you hear sir
varro's
second servant by your leave sir
flavius what do ye ask of me my friend
titus we wait for certain money here sir
flavius ay
 if money were as certain as your waiting
 twere sure enough
 why then preferr'd you not your sums and bills
 when your false masters eat of my lord's meat
 then they could smile and fawn upon his debts
 and take down the interest into their
 gluttonous maws
 you do yourselves but wrong to stir me up
 let me pass quietly
 believe t my lord and i have made an end
 i have no more to reckon he to spend
lucilius servant ay but this answer will not serve
flavius if twill not serve'tis not so base as you
 for you serve knaves
 exit
varro's
first servant how what does his cashiered worship mutter
varro's
second servant no matter what he's poor and that's revenge
 enough who can speak broader than he that has no
 house to put his head in such may rail against
 great buildings
 enter servilius
titus o here's servilius now we shall know some answer
servilius if i might beseech you gentlemen to repair some
 other hour i should derive much from't for
 take't of my soul my lord leans wondrously to
 discontent his comfortable temper has forsook him
 he's much out of health and keeps his chamber
lucilius servant many do keep their chambers are not sick
 and if it be so far beyond his health
 methinks he should the sooner pay his debts
 and make a clear way to the gods
servilius good gods
titus we cannot take this for answer sir
flaminius within servilius help my lord my lord
 enter timon in a rage flaminius following
timon what are my doors opposed against my passage
 have i been ever free and must my house
 be my retentive enemy my gaol
 the place which i have feasted does it now
 like all mankind show me an iron heart
lucilius servant put in now titus
titus my lord here is my bill
lucilius servant here's mine
hortensius and mine my lord
both
varro's servants and ours my lord
philotus all our bills
timon knock me down with em cleave me to the girdle
lucilius servant alas my lord
timon cut my heart in sums
titus mine fifty talents
timon tell out my blood
lucilius servant five thousand crowns my lord
timon five thousand drops pays that
 what yoursand yours
varro's
first servant my lord
varro's
second servant my lord
timon tear me take me and the gods fall upon you
 exit
hortensius faith i perceive our masters may throw their caps
 at their money these debts may well be called
 desperate ones for a madman owes em
 exeunt
 reenter timon and flavius
timon they have e'en put my breath from me the slaves
 creditors devils
flavius my dear lord
timon what if it should be so
flavius my lord
timon i'll have it so my steward
flavius here my lord
timon so fitly go bid all my friends again
