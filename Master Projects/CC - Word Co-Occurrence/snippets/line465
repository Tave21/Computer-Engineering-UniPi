shylock here tis most reverend doctor here it is
portia shylock there's thrice thy money offer'd thee
shylock an oath an oath i have an oath in heaven
 shall i lay perjury upon my soul
 no not for venice
portia why this bond is forfeit
 and lawfully by this the jew may claim
 a pound of flesh to be by him cut off
 nearest the merchant's heart be merciful
 take thrice thy money bid me tear the bond
shylock when it is paid according to the tenor
 it doth appear you are a worthy judge
 you know the law your exposition
 hath been most sound i charge you by the law
 whereof you are a welldeserving pillar
 proceed to judgment by my soul i swear
 there is no power in the tongue of man
 to alter me i stay here on my bond
antonio most heartily i do beseech the court
 to give the judgment
portia why then thus it is
 you must prepare your bosom for his knife
shylock o noble judge o excellent young man
portia for the intent and purpose of the law
 hath full relation to the penalty
 which here appeareth due upon the bond
shylock tis very true o wise and upright judge
 how much more elder art thou than thy looks
portia therefore lay bare your bosom
shylock ay his breast
 so says the bond doth it not noble judge
 nearest his heart those are the very words
portia it is so are there balance here to weigh
 the flesh
shylock i have them ready
portia have by some surgeon shylock on your charge
 to stop his wounds lest he do bleed to death
shylock is it so nominated in the bond
portia it is not so express'd but what of that
 twere good you do so much for charity
shylock i cannot find it tis not in the bond
portia you merchant have you any thing to say
antonio but little i am arm'd and well prepared
 give me your hand bassanio fare you well
 grieve not that i am fallen to this for you
 for herein fortune shows herself more kind
 than is her custom it is still her use
 to let the wretched man outlive his wealth
 to view with hollow eye and wrinkled brow
 an age of poverty from which lingering penance
 of such misery doth she cut me off
 commend me to your honourable wife
 tell her the process of antonio's end
 say how i loved you speak me fair in death
 and when the tale is told bid her be judge
 whether bassanio had not once a love
 repent but you that you shall lose your friend
 and he repents not that he pays your debt
 for if the jew do cut but deep enough
 i'll pay it presently with all my heart
bassanio antonio i am married to a wife
 which is as dear to me as life itself
 but life itself my wife and all the world
 are not with me esteem'd above thy life
 i would lose all ay sacrifice them all
 here to this devil to deliver you
portia your wife would give you little thanks for that
 if she were by to hear you make the offer
gratiano i have a wife whom i protest i love
 i would she were in heaven so she could
 entreat some power to change this currish jew
nerissa tis well you offer it behind her back
 the wish would make else an unquiet house
shylock these be the christian husbands i have a daughter
 would any of the stock of barrabas
 had been her husband rather than a christian
 aside
 we trifle time i pray thee pursue sentence
portia a pound of that same merchant's flesh is thine
 the court awards it and the law doth give it
shylock most rightful judge
portia and you must cut this flesh from off his breast
 the law allows it and the court awards it
shylock most learned judge a sentence come prepare
portia tarry a little there is something else
 this bond doth give thee here no jot of blood
 the words expressly are a pound of flesh'
 take then thy bond take thou thy pound of flesh
 but in the cutting it if thou dost shed
 one drop of christian blood thy lands and goods
 are by the laws of venice confiscate
 unto the state of venice
gratiano o upright judge mark jew o learned judge
shylock is that the law
portia thyself shalt see the act
 for as thou urgest justice be assured
 thou shalt have justice more than thou desirest
gratiano o learned judge mark jew a learned judge
shylock i take this offer then pay the bond thrice
 and let the christian go
bassanio here is the money
portia soft
 the jew shall have all justice soft no haste
 he shall have nothing but the penalty
gratiano o jew an upright judge a learned judge
portia therefore prepare thee to cut off the flesh
 shed thou no blood nor cut thou less nor more
 but just a pound of flesh if thou cut'st more
 or less than a just pound be it but so much
 as makes it light or heavy in the substance
 or the division of the twentieth part
 of one poor scruple nay if the scale do turn
 but in the estimation of a hair
 thou diest and all thy goods are confiscate
gratiano a second daniel a daniel jew
 now infidel i have you on the hip
portia why doth the jew pause take thy forfeiture
shylock give me my principal and let me go
bassanio i have it ready for thee here it is
portia he hath refused it in the open court
 he shall have merely justice and his bond
gratiano a daniel still say i a second daniel
 i thank thee jew for teaching me that word
shylock shall i not have barely my principal
portia thou shalt have nothing but the forfeiture
 to be so taken at thy peril jew
shylock why then the devil give him good of it
 i'll stay no longer question
portia tarry jew
 the law hath yet another hold on you
 it is enacted in the laws of venice
 if it be proved against an alien
 that by direct or indirect attempts
 he seek the life of any citizen
 the party gainst the which he doth contrive
 shall seize one half his goods the other half
 comes to the privy coffer of the state
 and the offender's life lies in the mercy
 of the duke only gainst all other voice
 in which predicament i say thou stand'st
 for it appears by manifest proceeding
 that indirectly and directly too
 thou hast contrived against the very life
 of the defendant and thou hast incurr'd
 the danger formerly by me rehearsed
 down therefore and beg mercy of the duke
gratiano beg that thou mayst have leave to hang thyself
 and yet thy wealth being forfeit to the state
 thou hast not left the value of a cord
 therefore thou must be hang'd at the state's charge
duke that thou shalt see the difference of our spirits
 i pardon thee thy life before thou ask it
 for half thy wealth it is antonio's
 the other half comes to the general state
 which humbleness may drive unto a fine
portia ay for the state not for antonio
shylock nay take my life and all pardon not that
 you take my house when you do take the prop
 that doth sustain my house you take my life
 when you do take the means whereby i live
portia what mercy can you render him antonio
gratiano a halter gratis nothing else for god's sake
antonio so please my lord the duke and all the court
 to quit the fine for one half of his goods
 i am content so he will let me have
 the other half in use to render it
 upon his death unto the gentleman
 that lately stole his daughter
 two things provided more that for this favour
 he presently become a christian
 the other that he do record a gift
 here in the court of all he dies possess'd
 unto his son lorenzo and his daughter
duke he shall do this or else i do recant
 the pardon that i late pronounced here
portia art thou contented jew what dost thou say
shylock i am content
portia clerk draw a deed of gift
shylock i pray you give me leave to go from hence
 i am not well send the deed after me
 and i will sign it
duke get thee gone but do it
gratiano in christening shalt thou have two godfathers
 had i been judge thou shouldst have had ten more
 to bring thee to the gallows not the font
 exit shylock
duke sir i entreat you home with me to dinner
portia i humbly do desire your grace of pardon
 i must away this night toward padua
 and it is meet i presently set forth
duke i am sorry that your leisure serves you not
 antonio gratify this gentleman
 for in my mind you are much bound to him
 exeunt duke and his train
bassanio most worthy gentleman i and my friend
 have by your wisdom been this day acquitted
 of grievous penalties in lieu whereof
 three thousand ducats due unto the jew
 we freely cope your courteous pains withal
antonio and stand indebted over and above
