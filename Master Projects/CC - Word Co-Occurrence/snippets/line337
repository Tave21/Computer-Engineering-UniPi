to make him moan but pity not his moans
stone him with harden'd hearts harder than stones
and let mild women to him lose their mildness
wilder to him than tigers in their wildness
'let him have time to tear his curled hair
let him have time against himself to rave
let him have time of time's help to despair
let him have time to live a loathed slave
let him have time a beggar's orts to crave
and time to see one that by alms doth live
disdain to him disdained scraps to give
'let him have time to see his friends his foes
and merry fools to mock at him resort
let him have time to mark how slow time goes
in time of sorrow and how swift and short
his time of folly and his time of sport
and ever let his unrecalling crime
have time to wail th abusing of his time
'o time thou tutor both to good and bad
teach me to curse him that thou taught'st this ill
at his own shadow let the thief run mad
himself himself seek every hour to kill
such wretched hands such wretched blood should spill
for who so base would such an office have
as slanderous death'sman to so base a slave
'the baser is he coming from a king
to shame his hope with deeds degenerate
the mightier man the mightier is the thing
that makes him honour'd or begets him hate
for greatest scandal waits on greatest state
the moon being clouded presently is miss'd
but little stars may hide them when they list
'the crow may bathe his coalblack wings in mire
and unperceived fly with the filth away
but if the like the snowwhite swan desire
the stain upon his silver down will stay
poor grooms are sightless night kings glorious day
gnats are unnoted wheresoe'er they fly
but eagles gazed upon with every eye
'out idle words servants to shallow fools
unprofitable sounds weak arbitrators
busy yourselves in skillcontending schools
debate where leisure serves with dull debaters
to trembling clients be you mediators
for me i force not argument a straw
since that my case is past the help of law
'in vain i rail at opportunity
at time at tarquin and uncheerful night
in vain i cavil with mine infamy
in vain i spurn at my confirm'd despite
this helpless smoke of words doth me no right
the remedy indeed to do me good
is to let forth my fouldefiled blood
'poor hand why quiver'st thou at this decree
honour thyself to rid me of this shame
for if i die my honour lives in thee
but if i live thou livest in my defame
since thou couldst not defend thy loyal dame
and wast afeard to scratch her wicked foe
kill both thyself and her for yielding so'
this said from her betumbled couch she starteth
to find some desperate instrument of death
but this no slaughterhouse no tool imparteth
to make more vent for passage of her breath
which thronging through her lips so vanisheth
as smoke from aetna that in air consumes
or that which from discharged cannon fumes
'in vain quoth she i live and seek in vain
some happy mean to end a hapless life
i fear'd by tarquin's falchion to be slain
yet for the selfsame purpose seek a knife
but when i fear'd i was a loyal wife
so am i now o no that cannot be
of that true type hath tarquin rifled me
'o that is gone for which i sought to live
and therefore now i need not fear to die
to clear this spot by death at least i give
a badge of fame to slander's livery
a dying life to living infamy
poor helpless help the treasure stol'n away
to burn the guiltless casket where it lay
'well well dear collatine thou shalt not know
the stained taste of violated troth
i will not wrong thy true affection so
to flatter thee with an infringed oath
this bastard graff shall never come to growth
he shall not boast who did thy stock pollute
that thou art doting father of his fruit
'nor shall he smile at thee in secret thought
nor laugh with his companions at thy state
but thou shalt know thy interest was not bought
basely with gold but stol'n from forth thy gate
for me i am the mistress of my fate
and with my trespass never will dispense
till life to death acquit my forced offence
'i will not poison thee with my attaint
nor fold my fault in cleanlycoin'd excuses
my sable ground of sin i will not paint
to hide the truth of this false night's abuses
my tongue shall utter all mine eyes like sluices
as from a mountainspring that feeds a dale
shall gush pure streams to purge my impure tale'
by this lamenting philomel had ended
the welltuned warble of her nightly sorrow
and solemn night with slow sad gait descended
to ugly hell when lo the blushing morrow
lends light to all fair eyes that light will borrow
but cloudy lucrece shames herself to see
and therefore still in night would cloister'd be
revealing day through every cranny spies
and seems to point her out where she sits weeping
to whom she sobbing speaks o eye of eyes
why pry'st thou through my window leave thy peeping
mock with thy tickling beams eyes that are sleeping
brand not my forehead with thy piercing light
for day hath nought to do what's done by night'
thus cavils she with every thing she sees
true grief is fond and testy as a child
who wayward once his mood with nought agrees
old woes not infant sorrows bear them mild
continuance tames the one the other wild
like an unpractised swimmer plunging still
with too much labour drowns for want of skill
so she deepdrenched in a sea of care
holds disputation with each thing she views
and to herself all sorrow doth compare
no object but her passion's strength renews
and as one shifts another straight ensues
sometime her grief is dumb and hath no words
sometime tis mad and too much talk affords
the little birds that tune their morning's joy
make her moans mad with their sweet melody
for mirth doth search the bottom of annoy
sad souls are slain in merry company
grief best is pleased with grief's society
true sorrow then is feelingly sufficed
when with like semblance it is sympathized
'tis double death to drown in ken of shore
he ten times pines that pines beholding food
to see the salve doth make the wound ache more
great grief grieves most at that would do it good
deep woes roll forward like a gentle flood
who being stopp'd the bounding banks o'erflows
grief dallied with nor law nor limit knows
'you mockingbirds quoth she your tunes entomb
within your hollowswelling feather'd breasts
and in my hearing be you mute and dumb
my restless discord loves no stops nor rests
a woeful hostess brooks not merry guests
relish your nimble notes to pleasing ears
distress likes dumps when time is kept with tears
'come philomel that sing'st of ravishment
make thy sad grove in my dishevell'd hair
as the dank earth weeps at thy languishment
so i at each sad strain will strain a tear
and with deep groans the diapason bear
for burdenwise i'll hum on tarquin still
while thou on tereus descant'st better skill
'and whiles against a thorn thou bear'st thy part
to keep thy sharp woes waking wretched i
to imitate thee well against my heart
will fix a sharp knife to affright mine eye
who if it wink shall thereon fall and die
these means as frets upon an instrument
shall tune our heartstrings to true languishment
'and for poor bird thou sing'st not in the day
as shaming any eye should thee behold
some dark deep desert seated from the way
that knows not parching heat nor freezing cold
will we find out and there we will unfold
to creatures stern sad tunes to change their kinds
since men prove beasts let beasts bear gentle minds'
as the poor frighted deer that stands at gaze
wildly determining which way to fly
or one encompass'd with a winding maze
that cannot tread the way out readily
so with herself is she in mutiny
to live or die which of the twain were better
when life is shamed and death reproach's debtor
'to kill myself quoth she alack what were it
but with my body my poor soul's pollution
they that lose half with greater patience bear it
than they whose whole is swallow'd in confusion
that mother tries a merciless conclusion
who having two sweet babes when death takes one
will slay the other and be nurse to none
'my body or my soul which was the dearer
when the one pure the other made divine
whose love of either to myself was nearer
when both were kept for heaven and collatine
ay me the bark peel'd from the lofty pine
his leaves will wither and his sap decay
so must my soul her bark being peel'd away
'her house is sack'd her quiet interrupted
her mansion batter'd by the enemy
her sacred temple spotted spoil'd corrupted
grossly engirt with daring infamy
then let it not be call'd impiety
if in this blemish'd fort i make some hole
through which i may convey this troubled soul
