 hath seen such scarecrows i'll not march through
 coventry with them that's flat nay and the
 villains march wide betwixt the legs as if they had
 gyves on for indeed i had the most of them out of
 prison there's but a shirt and a half in all my
 company and the half shirt is two napkins tacked
 together and thrown over the shoulders like an
 herald's coat without sleeves and the shirt to say
 the truth stolen from my host at saint alban's or
 the rednose innkeeper of daventry but that's all
 one they'll find linen enough on every hedge

scene iii the rebel camp near shrewsbury
 enter hotspur worcester douglas and vernon
hotspur we'll fight with him tonight
earl of worcester it may not be
earl of douglas you give him then the advantage
vernon not a whit
hotspur why say you so looks he not for supply
vernon so do we
hotspur his is certain ours is doubtful
earl of worcester good cousin be advised stir not tonight
vernon do not my lord
earl of douglas you do not counsel well
 you speak it out of fear and cold heart
vernon do me no slander douglas by my life
 and i dare well maintain it with my life
 if wellrespected honour bid me on
 i hold as little counsel with weak fear
 as you my lord or any scot that this day lives
 let it be seen tomorrow in the battle
 which of us fears
earl of douglas yea or tonight
vernon content
hotspur tonight say i
vernon come come it nay not be i wonder much
 being men of such great leading as you are
 that you foresee not what impediments
 drag back our expedition certain horse
 of my cousin vernon's are not yet come up
 your uncle worcester's horse came but today
 and now their pride and mettle is asleep
 their courage with hard labour tame and dull
 that not a horse is half the half of himself
hotspur so are the horses of the enemy
 in general journeybated and brought low
 the better part of ours are full of rest
earl of worcester the number of the king exceedeth ours
 for god's sake cousin stay till all come in
 the trumpet sounds a parley
 enter sir walter blunt
sir walter blunt i come with gracious offers from the king
 if you vouchsafe me hearing and respect
hotspur welcome sir walter blunt and would to god
 you were of our determination
 some of us love you well and even those some
 envy your great deservings and good name
 because you are not of our quality
 but stand against us like an enemy
sir walter blunt and god defend but still i should stand so
 so long as out of limit and true rule
 you stand against anointed majesty
 but to my charge the king hath sent to know
 the nature of your griefs and whereupon
 you conjure from the breast of civil peace
 such bold hostility teaching his duteous land
 audacious cruelty if that the king
 have any way your good deserts forgot
 which he confesseth to be manifold
 he bids you name your griefs and with all speed
 you shall have your desires with interest
 and pardon absolute for yourself and these
 herein misled by your suggestion
hotspur the king is kind and well we know the king
 knows at what time to promise when to pay
 my father and my uncle and myself
 did give him that same royalty he wears
 and when he was not six and twenty strong
 sick in the world's regard wretched and low
 a poor unminded outlaw sneaking home
 my father gave him welcome to the shore
 and when he heard him swear and vow to god
 he came but to be duke of lancaster
 to sue his livery and beg his peace
 with tears of innocency and terms of zeal
 my father in kind heart and pity moved
 swore him assistance and perform'd it too
 now when the lords and barons of the realm
 perceived northumberland did lean to him
 the more and less came in with cap and knee
 met him in boroughs cities villages
 attended him on bridges stood in lanes
 laid gifts before him proffer'd him their oaths
 gave him their heirs as pages follow'd him
 even at the heels in golden multitudes
 he presently as greatness knows itself
 steps me a little higher than his vow
 made to my father while his blood was poor
 upon the naked shore at ravenspurgh
 and now forsooth takes on him to reform
 some certain edicts and some strait decrees
 that lie too heavy on the commonwealth
 cries out upon abuses seems to weep
 over his country's wrongs and by this face
 this seeming brow of justice did he win
 the hearts of all that he did angle for
 proceeded further cut me off the heads
 of all the favourites that the absent king
 in deputation left behind him here
 when he was personal in the irish war
sir walter blunt tut i came not to hear this
hotspur then to the point
 in short time after he deposed the king
 soon after that deprived him of his life
 and in the neck of that task'd the whole state
 to make that worse suffer'd his kinsman march
 who is if every owner were well placed
 indeed his king to be engaged in wales
 there without ransom to lie forfeited
 disgraced me in my happy victories
 sought to entrap me by intelligence
 rated mine uncle from the councilboard
 in rage dismiss'd my father from the court
 broke oath on oath committed wrong on wrong
 and in conclusion drove us to seek out
 this head of safety and withal to pry
 into his title the which we find
 too indirect for long continuance
sir walter blunt shall i return this answer to the king
hotspur not so sir walter we'll withdraw awhile
 go to the king and let there be impawn'd
 some surety for a safe return again
 and in the morning early shall my uncle
 bring him our purposes and so farewell
sir walter blunt i would you would accept of grace and love
hotspur and may be so we shall
sir walter blunt pray god you do

act iv
scene iv york the archbishop's palace
 enter the archbishop of york and sir michael
archbishop of york hie good sir michael bear this sealed brief
 with winged haste to the lord marshal
 this to my cousin scroop and all the rest
 to whom they are directed if you knew
 how much they do to import you would make haste
sir michael my good lord
 i guess their tenor
archbishop of york like enough you do
 tomorrow good sir michael is a day
 wherein the fortune of ten thousand men
 must bide the touch for sir at shrewsbury
 as i am truly given to understand
 the king with mighty and quickraised power
 meets with lord harry and i fear sir michael
 what with the sickness of northumberland
 whose power was in the first proportion
 and what with owen glendower's absence thence
 who with them was a rated sinew too
 and comes not in o'erruled by prophecies
 i fear the power of percy is too weak
 to wage an instant trial with the king
sir michael why my good lord you need not fear
 there is douglas and lord mortimer
