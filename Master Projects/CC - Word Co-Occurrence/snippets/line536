biondello i go
 exit
baptista son i'll be your half bianca comes
lucentio i'll have no halves i'll bear it all myself
 reenter biondello
 how now what news
biondello sir my mistress sends you word
 that she is busy and she cannot come
petruchio how she is busy and she cannot come
 is that an answer
gremio ay and a kind one too
 pray god sir your wife send you not a worse
petruchio i hope better
hortensio sirrah biondello go and entreat my wife
 to come to me forthwith
 exit biondello
petruchio o ho entreat her
 nay then she must needs come
hortensio i am afraid sir
 do what you can yours will not be entreated
 reenter biondello
 now where's my wife
biondello she says you have some goodly jest in hand
 she will not come she bids you come to her
petruchio worse and worse she will not come o vile
 intolerable not to be endured
 sirrah grumio go to your mistress
 say i command her to come to me
 exit grumio
hortensio i know her answer
petruchio what
hortensio she will not
petruchio the fouler fortune mine and there an end
baptista now by my holidame here comes katharina
 reenter katarina
katharina what is your will sir that you send for me
petruchio where is your sister and hortensio's wife
katharina they sit conferring by the parlor fire
petruchio go fetch them hither if they deny to come
 swinge me them soundly forth unto their husbands
 away i say and bring them hither straight
 exit katharina
lucentio here is a wonder if you talk of a wonder
hortensio and so it is i wonder what it bodes
petruchio marry peace it bodes and love and quiet life
 and awful rule and right supremacy
 and to be short what not that's sweet and happy
baptista now fair befal thee good petruchio
 the wager thou hast won and i will add
 unto their losses twenty thousand crowns
 another dowry to another daughter
 for she is changed as she had never been
petruchio nay i will win my wager better yet
 and show more sign of her obedience
 her newbuilt virtue and obedience
 see where she comes and brings your froward wives
 as prisoners to her womanly persuasion
 reenter katharina with bianca and widow
 katharina that cap of yours becomes you not
 off with that bauble throw it underfoot
widow lord let me never have a cause to sigh
 till i be brought to such a silly pass
bianca fie what a foolish duty call you this
lucentio i would your duty were as foolish too
 the wisdom of your duty fair bianca
 hath cost me an hundred crowns since suppertime
bianca the more fool you for laying on my duty
petruchio katharina i charge thee tell these headstrong women
 what duty they do owe their lords and husbands
widow come come you're mocking we will have no telling
petruchio come on i say and first begin with her
widow she shall not
petruchio i say she shall and first begin with her
katharina fie fie unknit that threatening unkind brow
 and dart not scornful glances from those eyes
 to wound thy lord thy king thy governor
 it blots thy beauty as frosts do bite the meads
 confounds thy fame as whirlwinds shake fair buds
 and in no sense is meet or amiable
 a woman moved is like a fountain troubled
 muddy illseeming thick bereft of beauty
 and while it is so none so dry or thirsty
 will deign to sip or touch one drop of it
 thy husband is thy lord thy life thy keeper
 thy head thy sovereign one that cares for thee
 and for thy maintenance commits his body
 to painful labour both by sea and land
 to watch the night in storms the day in cold
 whilst thou liest warm at home secure and safe
 and craves no other tribute at thy hands
 but love fair looks and true obedience
 too little payment for so great a debt
 such duty as the subject owes the prince
 even such a woman oweth to her husband
 and when she is froward peevish sullen sour
 and not obedient to his honest will
 what is she but a foul contending rebel
 and graceless traitor to her loving lord
 i am ashamed that women are so simple
 to offer war where they should kneel for peace
 or seek for rule supremacy and sway
 when they are bound to serve love and obey
 why are our bodies soft and weak and smooth
 unapt to toil and trouble in the world
 but that our soft conditions and our hearts
 should well agree with our external parts
 come come you froward and unable worms
 my mind hath been as big as one of yours
 my heart as great my reason haply more
 to bandy word for word and frown for frown
 but now i see our lances are but straws
 our strength as weak our weakness past compare
 that seeming to be most which we indeed least are
 then vail your stomachs for it is no boot
 and place your hands below your husband's foot
 in token of which duty if he please
 my hand is ready may it do him ease
petruchio why there's a wench come on and kiss me kate
lucentio well go thy ways old lad for thou shalt ha't
vincentio tis a good hearing when children are toward
lucentio but a harsh hearing when women are froward
petruchio come kate we'll to bed
 we three are married but you two are sped
 to lucentio
 twas i won the wager though you hit the white
 and being a winner god give you good night
 exeunt petruchio and katharina
hortensio now go thy ways thou hast tamed a curst shrew
lucentio tis a wonder by your leave she will be tamed so
 exeunt
