leonato daughter remember what i told you if the prince
 do solicit you in that kind you know your answer
beatrice the fault will be in the music cousin if you be
 not wooed in good time if the prince be too
 important tell him there is measure in every thing
 and so dance out the answer for hear me hero
 wooing wedding and repenting is as a scotch jig
 a measure and a cinque pace the first suit is hot
 and hasty like a scotch jig and full as
 fantastical the wedding mannerlymodest as a
 measure full of state and ancientry and then comes
 repentance and with his bad legs falls into the
 cinque pace faster and faster till he sink into his grave
leonato cousin you apprehend passing shrewdly
beatrice i have a good eye uncle i can see a church by daylight
leonato the revellers are entering brother make good room

don pedro and when please you to say so
hero when i like your favour for god defend the lute
 should be like the case

antonio to tell you true i counterfeit him
ursula you could never do him so illwell unless you were
 the very man here's his dry hand up and down you
 are he you are he
antonio at a word i am not
ursula come come do you think i do not know you by your
 excellent wit can virtue hide itself go to
 mum you are he graces will appear and there's an
 end
beatrice will you not tell me who told you so
benedick no you shall pardon me
beatrice nor will you not tell me who you are
benedick not now
beatrice that i was disdainful and that i had my good wit
 out of the hundred merry tales'well this was
 signior benedick that said so
benedick what's he
beatrice i am sure you know him well enough
benedick not i believe me
beatrice did he never make you laugh
benedick i pray you what is he
beatrice why he is the prince's jester a very dull fool
 only his gift is in devising impossible slanders
 none but libertines delight in him and the
 commendation is not in his wit but in his villany
 for he both pleases men and angers them and then
 they laugh at him and beat him i am sure he is in
 the fleet i would he had boarded me
benedick when i know the gentleman i'll tell him what you say
beatrice do do he'll but break a comparison or two on me
 which peradventure not marked or not laughed at
 strikes him into melancholy and then there's a
 partridge wing saved for the fool will eat no
 supper that night
 music
 we must follow the leaders
benedick in every good thing
beatrice nay if they lead to any ill i will leave them at
 the next turning
 dance then exeunt all except don john borachio
 and claudio
don john sure my brother is amorous on hero and hath
 withdrawn her father to break with him about it
 the ladies follow her and but one visor remains
borachio and that is claudio i know him by his bearing
don john are not you signior benedick
claudio you know me well i am he
don john signior you are very near my brother in his love
 he is enamoured on hero i pray you dissuade him
 from her she is no equal for his birth you may
 do the part of an honest man in it
claudio how know you he loves her
don john i heard him swear his affection
borachio so did i too and he swore he would marry her tonight
don john come let us to the banquet
 exeunt don john and borachio
claudio thus answer i in the name of benedick
 but hear these ill news with the ears of claudio
 tis certain so the prince wooes for himself
 friendship is constant in all other things
 save in the office and affairs of love
 therefore all hearts in love use their own tongues
 let every eye negotiate for itself
 and trust no agent for beauty is a witch
 against whose charms faith melteth into blood
 this is an accident of hourly proof
 which i mistrusted not farewell therefore hero
 reenter benedick
benedick count claudio
claudio yea the same
benedick come will you go with me
claudio whither
benedick even to the next willow about your own business
 county what fashion will you wear the garland of
 about your neck like an usurer's chain or under
 your arm like a lieutenant's scarf you must wear
 it one way for the prince hath got your hero
claudio i wish him joy of her
benedick why that's spoken like an honest drovier so they
 sell bullocks but did you think the prince would
 have served you thus
claudio i pray you leave me
benedick ho now you strike like the blind man twas the
 boy that stole your meat and you'll beat the post
claudio if it will not be i'll leave you
 exit
benedick alas poor hurt fowl now will he creep into sedges
 but that my lady beatrice should know me and not
 know me the prince's fool ha it may be i go
 under that title because i am merry yea but so i
 am apt to do myself wrong i am not so reputed it
 is the base though bitter disposition of beatrice
 that puts the world into her person and so gives me
 out well i'll be revenged as i may
 reenter don pedro
don pedro now signior where's the count did you see him
benedick troth my lord i have played the part of lady fame
 i found him here as melancholy as a lodge in a
 warren i told him and i think i told him true
 that your grace had got the good will of this young
 lady and i offered him my company to a willowtree
 either to make him a garland as being forsaken or
 to bind him up a rod as being worthy to be whipped
don pedro to be whipped what's his fault
benedick the flat transgression of a schoolboy who being
 overjoyed with finding a birds nest shows it his
 companion and he steals it
don pedro wilt thou make a trust a transgression the
 transgression is in the stealer
benedick yet it had not been amiss the rod had been made
 and the garland too for the garland he might have
 worn himself and the rod he might have bestowed on
 you who as i take it have stolen his birds nest
don pedro i will but teach them to sing and restore them to
 the owner
benedick if their singing answer your saying by my faith
 you say honestly
don pedro the lady beatrice hath a quarrel to you the
 gentleman that danced with her told her she is much
 wronged by you
benedick o she misused me past the endurance of a block
 an oak but with one green leaf on it would have
 answered her my very visor began to assume life and
 scold with her she told me not thinking i had been
 myself that i was the prince's jester that i was
 duller than a great thaw huddling jest upon jest
 with such impossible conveyance upon me that i stood
 like a man at a mark with a whole army shooting at
 me she speaks poniards and every word stabs
 if her breath were as terrible as her terminations
 there were no living near her she would infect to
 the north star i would not marry her though she
 were endowed with all that adam bad left him before
 he transgressed she would have made hercules have
 turned spit yea and have cleft his club to make
 the fire too come talk not of her you shall find
 her the infernal ate in good apparel i would to god
 some scholar would conjure her for certainly while
 she is here a man may live as quiet in hell as in a
 sanctuary and people sin upon purpose because they
 would go thither so indeed all disquiet horror
 and perturbation follows her
don pedro look here she comes
 enter claudio beatrice hero and leonato
benedick will your grace command me any service to the
 world's end i will go on the slightest errand now
 to the antipodes that you can devise to send me on
 i will fetch you a toothpicker now from the
 furthest inch of asia bring you the length of
 prester john's foot fetch you a hair off the great
 cham's beard do you any embassage to the pigmies
 rather than hold three words conference with this
 harpy you have no employment for me
don pedro none but to desire your good company
benedick o god sir here's a dish i love not i cannot
