 of homage and i know not how much tribute
 should presently extirpate me and mine
 out of the dukedom and confer fair milan
 with all the honours on my brother whereon
 a treacherous army levied one midnight
 fated to the purpose did antonio open
 the gates of milan and i the dead of darkness
 the ministers for the purpose hurried thence
 me and thy crying self
miranda alack for pity
 i not remembering how i cried out then
 will cry it o'er again it is a hint
 that wrings mine eyes to't
prospero hear a little further
 and then i'll bring thee to the present business
 which now's upon's without the which this story
 were most impertinent
miranda wherefore did they not
 that hour destroy us
prospero well demanded wench
 my tale provokes that question dear they durst not
 so dear the love my people bore me nor set
 a mark so bloody on the business but
 with colours fairer painted their foul ends
 in few they hurried us aboard a bark
 bore us some leagues to sea where they prepared
 a rotten carcass of a boat not rigg'd
 nor tackle sail nor mast the very rats
 instinctively had quit it there they hoist us
 to cry to the sea that roar'd to us to sigh
 to the winds whose pity sighing back again
 did us but loving wrong
miranda alack what trouble
 was i then to you
prospero o a cherubim
 thou wast that did preserve me thou didst smile
 infused with a fortitude from heaven
 when i have deck'd the sea with drops full salt
 under my burthen groan'd which raised in me
 an undergoing stomach to bear up
 against what should ensue
miranda how came we ashore
prospero by providence divine
 some food we had and some fresh water that
 a noble neapolitan gonzalo
 out of his charity being then appointed
 master of this design did give us with
 rich garments linens stuffs and necessaries
 which since have steaded much so of his gentleness
 knowing i loved my books he furnish'd me
 from mine own library with volumes that
 i prize above my dukedom
miranda would i might
 but ever see that man
prospero now i arise
 resumes his mantle
 sit still and hear the last of our seasorrow
 here in this island we arrived and here
 have i thy schoolmaster made thee more profit
 than other princesses can that have more time
 for vainer hours and tutors not so careful
miranda heavens thank you for't and now i pray you sir
 for still tis beating in my mind your reason
 for raising this seastorm
prospero know thus far forth
 by accident most strange bountiful fortune
 now my dear lady hath mine enemies
 brought to this shore and by my prescience
 i find my zenith doth depend upon
 a most auspicious star whose influence
 if now i court not but omit my fortunes
 will ever after droop here cease more questions
 thou art inclined to sleep tis a good dulness
 and give it way i know thou canst not choose
 miranda sleeps
 come away servant come i am ready now
 approach my ariel come
 enter ariel
ariel all hail great master grave sir hail i come
 to answer thy best pleasure be't to fly
 to swim to dive into the fire to ride
 on the curl'd clouds to thy strong bidding task
 ariel and all his quality
prospero hast thou spirit
 perform'd to point the tempest that i bade thee
ariel to every article
 i boarded the king's ship now on the beak
 now in the waist the deck in every cabin
 i flamed amazement sometime i'ld divide
 and burn in many places on the topmast
 the yards and bowsprit would i flame distinctly
 then meet and join jove's lightnings the precursors
 o the dreadful thunderclaps more momentary
 and sightoutrunning were not the fire and cracks
 of sulphurous roaring the most mighty neptune
 seem to besiege and make his bold waves tremble
 yea his dread trident shake
prospero my brave spirit
 who was so firm so constant that this coil
 would not infect his reason
ariel not a soul
 but felt a fever of the mad and play'd
 some tricks of desperation all but mariners
 plunged in the foaming brine and quit the vessel
 then all afire with me the king's son ferdinand
 with hair upstaringthen like reeds not hair
 was the first man that leap'd cried hell is empty
 and all the devils are here'
prospero why that's my spirit
 but was not this nigh shore
ariel close by my master
prospero but are they ariel safe
ariel not a hair perish'd
 on their sustaining garments not a blemish
 but fresher than before and as thou badest me
 in troops i have dispersed them bout the isle
 the king's son have i landed by himself
 whom i left cooling of the air with sighs
 in an odd angle of the isle and sitting
 his arms in this sad knot
prospero of the king's ship
 the mariners say how thou hast disposed
 and all the rest o the fleet
ariel safely in harbour
 is the king's ship in the deep nook where once
 thou call'dst me up at midnight to fetch dew
 from the stillvex'd bermoothes there she's hid
 the mariners all under hatches stow'd
 who with a charm join'd to their suffer'd labour
 i have left asleep and for the rest o the fleet
 which i dispersed they all have met again
 and are upon the mediterranean flote
 bound sadly home for naples
 supposing that they saw the king's ship wreck'd
 and his great person perish
prospero ariel thy charge
 exactly is perform'd but there's more work
 what is the time o the day
ariel past the mid season
prospero at least two glasses the time twixt six and now
 must by us both be spent most preciously
ariel is there more toil since thou dost give me pains
 let me remember thee what thou hast promised
 which is not yet perform'd me
prospero how now moody
 what is't thou canst demand
ariel my liberty
prospero before the time be out no more
ariel i prithee
 remember i have done thee worthy service
 told thee no lies made thee no mistakings served
 without or grudge or grumblings thou didst promise
 to bate me a full year
prospero dost thou forget
 from what a torment i did free thee
ariel no
prospero thou dost and think'st it much to tread the ooze
 of the salt deep
 to run upon the sharp wind of the north
 to do me business in the veins o the earth
 when it is baked with frost
ariel i do not sir
prospero thou liest malignant thing hast thou forgot
 the foul witch sycorax who with age and envy
 was grown into a hoop hast thou forgot her
ariel no sir
prospero thou hast where was she born speak tell me
ariel sir in argier
prospero o was she so i must
 once in a month recount what thou hast been
 which thou forget'st this damn'd witch sycorax
 for mischiefs manifold and sorceries terrible
 to enter human hearing from argier
 thou know'st was banish'd for one thing she did
 they would not take her life is not this true
ariel ay sir
prospero this blueeyed hag was hither brought with child
 and here was left by the sailors thou my slave
 as thou report'st thyself wast then her servant
 and for thou wast a spirit too delicate
 to act her earthy and abhorr'd commands
 refusing her grand hests she did confine thee
 by help of her more potent ministers
 and in her most unmitigable rage
 into a cloven pine within which rift
 imprison'd thou didst painfully remain
 a dozen years within which space she died
 and left thee there where thou didst vent thy groans
 as fast as millwheels strike then was this island
 save for the son that she did litter here
 a freckled whelp hagbornnot honour'd with
 a human shape
ariel yes caliban her son
prospero dull thing i say so he that caliban
 whom now i keep in service thou best know'st
 what torment i did find thee in thy groans
 did make wolves howl and penetrate the breasts
 of ever angry bears it was a torment
 to lay upon the damn'd which sycorax
 could not again undo it was mine art
