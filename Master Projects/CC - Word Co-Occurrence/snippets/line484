 that he hath turn'd a heaven unto a hell
lysander helen to you our minds we will unfold
 tomorrow night when phoebe doth behold
 her silver visage in the watery glass
 decking with liquid pearl the bladed grass
 a time that lovers flights doth still conceal
 through athens gates have we devised to steal
hermia and in the wood where often you and i
 upon faint primrosebeds were wont to lie
 emptying our bosoms of their counsel sweet
 there my lysander and myself shall meet
 and thence from athens turn away our eyes
 to seek new friends and stranger companies
 farewell sweet playfellow pray thou for us
 and good luck grant thee thy demetrius
 keep word lysander we must starve our sight
 from lovers food till morrow deep midnight
lysander i will my hermia
 exit hermia
 helena adieu
 as you on him demetrius dote on you
 exit
helena how happy some o'er other some can be
 through athens i am thought as fair as she
 but what of that demetrius thinks not so
 he will not know what all but he do know
 and as he errs doting on hermia's eyes
 so i admiring of his qualities
 things base and vile folding no quantity
 love can transpose to form and dignity
 love looks not with the eyes but with the mind
 and therefore is wing'd cupid painted blind
 nor hath love's mind of any judgement taste
 wings and no eyes figure unheedy haste
 and therefore is love said to be a child
 because in choice he is so oft beguiled
 as waggish boys in game themselves forswear
 so the boy love is perjured every where
 for ere demetrius look'd on hermia's eyne
 he hail'd down oaths that he was only mine
 and when this hail some heat from hermia felt
 so he dissolved and showers of oaths did melt
 i will go tell him of fair hermia's flight
 then to the wood will he tomorrow night
 pursue her and for this intelligence
 if i have thanks it is a dear expense
 but herein mean i to enrich my pain
 to have his sight thither and back again
 exit

act i
scene ii athens quince's house
 enter quince snug bottom flute snout and
 starveling
quince is all our company here
bottom you were best to call them generally man by man
 according to the scrip
quince here is the scroll of every man's name which is
 thought fit through all athens to play in our
 interlude before the duke and the duchess on his
 weddingday at night
bottom first good peter quince say what the play treats
 on then read the names of the actors and so grow
 to a point
quince marry our play is the most lamentable comedy and
 most cruel death of pyramus and thisby

 merry now good peter quince call forth your
 actors by the scroll masters spread yourselves
quince answer as i call you nick bottom the weaver
bottom ready name what part i am for and proceed

bottom what is pyramus a lover or a tyrant
quince a lover that kills himself most gallant for love
bottom that will ask some tears in the true performing of
 it if i do it let the audience look to their
 eyes i will move storms i will condole in some
 measure to the rest yet my chief humour is for a
 tyrant i could play ercles rarely or a part to
 tear a cat in to make all split
 the raging rocks
 and shivering shocks
 shall break the locks
 of prison gates
 and phibbus car
 shall shine from far
 and make and mar
 the foolish fates
 this was lofty now name the rest of the players
 this is ercles vein a tyrant's vein a lover is
 more condoling
quince francis flute the bellowsmender

bottom let me play the lion too i will roar that i will
 do any man's heart good to hear me i will roar
 that i will make the duke say let him roar again
 let him roar again'
quince an you should do it too terribly you would fright
 the duchess and the ladies that they would shriek
 and that were enough to hang us all
all that would hang us every mother's son
bottom i grant you friends if that you should fright the
 ladies out of their wits they would have no more
 discretion but to hang us but i will aggravate my
 voice so that i will roar you as gently as any
 sucking dove i will roar you an twere any
 nightingale
quince you can play no part but pyramus for pyramus is a
 sweetfaced man a proper man as one shall see in a
 summer's day a most lovely gentlemanlike man

bottom i will discharge it in either your strawcolour
 beard your orangetawny beard your purpleingrain
 beard or your frenchcrowncolour beard your
 perfect yellow

bottom we will meet and there we may rehearse most
 obscenely and courageously take pains be perfect adieu
quince at the duke's oak we meet
bottom enough hold or cut bowstrings
 exeunt
 a midsummer night's dream
act ii
scene i a wood near athens
 enter from opposite sides a fairy and puck
puck how now spirit whither wander you
fairy over hill over dale
 thorough bush thorough brier
 over park over pale
 thorough flood thorough fire
 i do wander everywhere
 swifter than the moon's sphere
 and i serve the fairy queen
 to dew her orbs upon the green
 the cowslips tall her pensioners be
 in their gold coats spots you see
 those be rubies fairy favours
 in those freckles live their savours
 i must go seek some dewdrops here
 and hang a pearl in every cowslip's ear
 farewell thou lob of spirits i'll be gone
 our queen and all our elves come here anon
puck the king doth keep his revels here tonight
 take heed the queen come not within his sight
 for oberon is passing fell and wrath
 because that she as her attendant hath
 a lovely boy stolen from an indian king
 she never had so sweet a changeling
 and jealous oberon would have the child
 knight of his train to trace the forests wild
 but she perforce withholds the loved boy
 crowns him with flowers and makes him all her joy
 and now they never meet in grove or green
 by fountain clear or spangled starlight sheen
 but they do square that all their elves for fear
 creep into acorncups and hide them there
fairy either i mistake your shape and making quite
 or else you are that shrewd and knavish sprite
 call'd robin goodfellow are not you he
 that frights the maidens of the villagery
 skim milk and sometimes labour in the quern
 and bootless make the breathless housewife churn
 and sometime make the drink to bear no barm
 mislead nightwanderers laughing at their harm
 those that hobgoblin call you and sweet puck
