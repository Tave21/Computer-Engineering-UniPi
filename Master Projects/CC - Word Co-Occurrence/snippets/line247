 what can man's wisdom
 in the restoring his bereaved sense
 he that helps him take all my outward worth
doctor there is means madam
 our fosternurse of nature is repose
 the which he lacks that to provoke in him
 are many simples operative whose power
 will close the eye of anguish
cordelia all blest secrets
 all you unpublish'd virtues of the earth

 in the good man's distress seek seek for him
 lest his ungovern'd rage dissolve the life
 that wants the means to lead it
 enter a messenger

cordelia tis known before our preparation stands
 in expectation of them o dear father

 my mourning and important tears hath pitied
 no blown ambition doth our arms incite
 but love dear love and our aged father's right

oswald madam with much ado
 your sister is the better soldier
regan lord edmund spake not with your lord at home
oswald no madam
regan what might import my sister's letter to him
oswald i know not lady
regan faith he is posted hence on serious matter
 it was great ignorance gloucester's eyes being out
 to let him live where he arrives he moves
 all hearts against us edmund i think is gone
 in pity of his misery to dispatch
 his nighted life moreover to descry
 the strength o the enemy
oswald i must needs after him madam with my letter
regan our troops set forth tomorrow stay with us
 the ways are dangerous

oswald madam i had rather
regan i know your lady does not love her husband
 i am sure of that and at her late being here
 she gave strange oeillades and most speaking looks
 to noble edmund i know you are of her bosom
oswald i madam

 therefore i do advise you take this note
 my lord is dead edmund and i have talk'd

 than for your lady's you may gather more
 if you do find him pray you give him this
 and when your mistress hears thus much from you
 i pray desire her call her wisdom to her
 so fare you well
 if you do chance to hear of that blind traitor
 preferment falls on him that cuts him off
oswald would i could meet him madam i should show
 what party i do follow

scene vi fields near dover
 enter gloucester and edgar dressed like a peasant
gloucester when shall we come to the top of that same hill
edgar you do climb up it now look how we labour
gloucester methinks the ground is even
edgar horrible steep
 hark do you hear the sea
gloucester no truly
edgar why then your other senses grow imperfect
 by your eyes anguish
gloucester so may it be indeed
 methinks thy voice is alter'd and thou speak'st
 in better phrase and matter than thou didst
edgar you're much deceived in nothing am i changed
 but in my garments
gloucester methinks you're better spoken
edgar come on sir here's the place stand still how fearful
 and dizzy tis to cast one's eyes so low
 the crows and choughs that wing the midway air
 show scarce so gross as beetles half way down
 hangs one that gathers samphire dreadful trade
 methinks he seems no bigger than his head
 the fishermen that walk upon the beach
 appear like mice and yond tall anchoring bark
 diminish'd to her cock her cock a buoy
 almost too small for sight the murmuring surge
 that on the unnumber'd idle pebbles chafes
 cannot be heard so high i'll look no more
 lest my brain turn and the deficient sight
 topple down headlong
gloucester set me where you stand
edgar give me your hand you are now within a foot
 of the extreme verge for all beneath the moon
 would i not leap upright
gloucester let go my hand
 here friend s another purse in it a jewel
 well worth a poor man's taking fairies and gods
 prosper it with thee go thou farther off
 bid me farewell and let me hear thee going
edgar now fare you well good sir
gloucester with all my heart
edgar why i do trifle thus with his despair
 is done to cure it
gloucester kneeling o you mighty gods
 this world i do renounce and in your sights
 shake patiently my great affliction off
 if i could bear it longer and not fall
 to quarrel with your great opposeless wills
 my snuff and loathed part of nature should
 burn itself out if edgar live o bless him
 now fellow fare thee well
 he falls forward
edgar gone sir farewell
 and yet i know not how conceit may rob
 the treasury of life when life itself
 yields to the theft had he been where he thought
 by this had thought been past alive or dead
 ho you sir friend hear you sir speak
 thus might he pass indeed yet he revives
 what are you sir
gloucester away and let me die
edgar hadst thou been aught but gossamer feathers air
 so many fathom down precipitating
 thou'dst shiver'd like an egg but thou dost breathe
 hast heavy substance bleed'st not speak'st art sound
 ten masts at each make not the altitude
 which thou hast perpendicularly fell
 thy life's a miracle speak yet again
gloucester but have i fall'n or no
edgar from the dread summit of this chalky bourn
 look up aheight the shrillgorged lark so far
 cannot be seen or heard do but look up
gloucester alack i have no eyes
 is wretchedness deprived that benefit
 to end itself by death twas yet some comfort
 when misery could beguile the tyrant's rage
 and frustrate his proud will
edgar give me your arm
 up so how is t feel you your legs you stand
gloucester too well too well
edgar this is above all strangeness
 upon the crown o the cliff what thing was that
 which parted from you
gloucester a poor unfortunate beggar
edgar as i stood here below methought his eyes
 were two full moons he had a thousand noses
 horns whelk'd and waved like the enridged sea
 it was some fiend therefore thou happy father
 think that the clearest gods who make them honours
 of men's impossibilities have preserved thee
gloucester i do remember now henceforth i'll bear
 affliction till it do cry out itself
 enough enough and die that thing you speak of
 i took it for a man often twould say
 the fiend the fiend he led me to that place
edgar bear free and patient thoughts but who comes here
 enter king lear fantastically dressed with wild flowers
 the safer sense will ne'er accommodate
 his master thus
king lear no they cannot touch me for coining i am the
 king himself
edgar o thou sidepiercing sight
king lear nature's above art in that respect there's your
 pressmoney that fellow handles his bow like a
 crowkeeper draw me a clothier's yard look
 look a mouse peace peace this piece of toasted
 cheese will do t there's my gauntlet i'll prove

gloucester i know that voice
king lear ha goneril with a white beard they flattered
 me like a dog and told me i had white hairs in my
 beard ere the black ones were there to say ay'
 and no to every thing that i said'ay and no'

 wet me once and the wind to make me chatter when
 the thunder would not peace at my bidding there i
