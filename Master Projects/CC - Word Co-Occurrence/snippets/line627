 so many of his shadows thou hast met
 and not the very king i have two boys
 seek percy and thyself about the field
 but seeing thou fall'st on me so luckily
 i will assay thee so defend thyself
earl of douglas i fear thou art another counterfeit
 and yet in faith thou bear'st thee like a king
 but mine i am sure thou art whoe'er thou be
 and thus i win thee
 they fight king henry being in danger prince
 henry enters
prince henry hold up thy head vile scot or thou art like
 never to hold it up again the spirits
 of valiant shirley stafford blunt are in my arms
 it is the prince of wales that threatens thee
 who never promiseth but he means to pay
 they fight douglas flies
 cheerly my lord how fares your grace
 sir nicholas gawsey hath for succor sent
 and so hath clifton i'll to clifton straight
king henry iv stay and breathe awhile
 thou hast redeem'd thy lost opinion
 and show'd thou makest some tender of my life
 in this fair rescue thou hast brought to me
prince henry o god they did me too much injury
 that ever said i hearken'd for your death
 if it were so i might have let alone
 the insulting hand of douglas over you
 which would have been as speedy in your end
 as all the poisonous potions in the world
 and saved the treacherous labour of your son
king henry iv make up to clifton i'll to sir nicholas gawsey
 exit
 enter hotspur
hotspur if i mistake not thou art harry monmouth
prince henry thou speak'st as if i would deny my name
hotspur my name is harry percy
prince henry why then i see
 a very valiant rebel of the name
 i am the prince of wales and think not percy
 to share with me in glory any more
 two stars keep not their motion in one sphere
 nor can one england brook a double reign
 of harry percy and the prince of wales
hotspur nor shall it harry for the hour is come
 to end the one of us and would to god
 thy name in arms were now as great as mine
prince henry i'll make it greater ere i part from thee
 and all the budding honours on thy crest
 i'll crop to make a garland for my head
hotspur i can no longer brook thy vanities
 they fight
 enter falstaff
falstaff well said hal to it hal nay you shall find no
 boy's play here i can tell you
 reenter douglas he fights with falstaff
 who falls down as if he were dead and exit
 douglas hotspur is wounded and falls
hotspur o harry thou hast robb'd me of my youth
 i better brook the loss of brittle life
 than those proud titles thou hast won of me
 they wound my thoughts worse than sword my flesh
 but thought's the slave of life and life time's fool
 and time that takes survey of all the world
 must have a stop o i could prophesy
 but that the earthy and cold hand of death
 lies on my tongue no percy thou art dust
 and food for
 dies
prince henry for worms brave percy fare thee well great heart
 illweaved ambition how much art thou shrunk
 when that this body did contain a spirit
 a kingdom for it was too small a bound
 but now two paces of the vilest earth
 is room enough this earth that bears thee dead
 bears not alive so stout a gentleman
 if thou wert sensible of courtesy
 i should not make so dear a show of zeal
 but let my favours hide thy mangled face
 and even in thy behalf i'll thank myself
 for doing these fair rites of tenderness
 adieu and take thy praise with thee to heaven
 thy ignominy sleep with thee in the grave
 but not remember'd in thy epitaph
 he spieth falstaff on the ground
 what old acquaintance could not all this flesh
 keep in a little life poor jack farewell
 i could have better spared a better man
 o i should have a heavy miss of thee
 if i were much in love with vanity
 death hath not struck so fat a deer today
 though many dearer in this bloody fray
 embowell'd will i see thee by and by
 till then in blood by noble percy lie
 exit prince henry
falstaff rising up embowelled if thou embowel me today
 i'll give you leave to powder me and eat me too
 tomorrow sblood'twas time to counterfeit or
 that hot termagant scot had paid me scot and lot too
 counterfeit i lie i am no counterfeit to die
 is to be a counterfeit for he is but the
 counterfeit of a man who hath not the life of a man
 but to counterfeit dying when a man thereby
 liveth is to be no counterfeit but the true and
 perfect image of life indeed the better part of
 valour is discretion in the which better part i
 have saved my life'zounds i am afraid of this
 gunpowder percy though he be dead how if he
 should counterfeit too and rise by my faith i am
 afraid he would prove the better counterfeit
 therefore i'll make him sure yea and i'll swear i
 killed him why may not he rise as well as i
 nothing confutes me but eyes and nobody sees me
 therefore sirrah
 stabbing him
 with a new wound in your thigh come you along with me
 takes up hotspur on his back
 reenter prince henry and lord john of lancaster
prince henry come brother john full bravely hast thou flesh'd
 thy maiden sword
lancaster but soft whom have we here
 did you not tell me this fat man was dead
prince henry i did i saw him dead
 breathless and bleeding on the ground art
 thou alive
 or is it fantasy that plays upon our eyesight
 i prithee speak we will not trust our eyes
 without our ears thou art not what thou seem'st
falstaff no that's certain i am not a double man but if i
 be not jack falstaff then am i a jack there is percy
 throwing the body down
 if your father will do me any honour so if not let
 him kill the next percy himself i look to be either
 earl or duke i can assure you
prince henry why percy i killed myself and saw thee dead
falstaff didst thou lord lord how this world is given to
 lying i grant you i was down and out of breath
 and so was he but we rose both at an instant and
 fought a long hour by shrewsbury clock if i may be
 believed so if not let them that should reward
 valour bear the sin upon their own heads i'll take
 it upon my death i gave him this wound in the
 thigh if the man were alive and would deny it
 zounds i would make him eat a piece of my sword
lancaster this is the strangest tale that ever i heard
prince henry this is the strangest fellow brother john
 come bring your luggage nobly on your back
 for my part if a lie may do thee grace
 i'll gild it with the happiest terms i have
 a retreat is sounded
 the trumpet sounds retreat the day is ours
 come brother let us to the highest of the field
 to see what friends are living who are dead
 exeunt prince henry and lancaster
falstaff i'll follow as they say for reward he that
 rewards me god reward him if i do grow great
 i'll grow less for i'll purge and leave sack and
 live cleanly as a nobleman should do
 exit

 henry lord john lancaster earl of westmoreland
 with worcester and vernon prisoners

 illspirited worcester did not we send grace
 pardon and terms of love to all of you

 if like a christian thou hadst truly borne
 betwixt our armies true intelligence

prince henry the noble scot lord douglas when he saw
 the fortune of the day quite turn'd from him
 the noble percy slain and all his men
 upon the foot of fear fled with the rest
 and falling from a hill he was so bruised
 that the pursuers took him at my tent
 the douglas is and i beseech your grace
 i may dispose of him
king henry iv with all my heart
prince henry then brother john of lancaster to you
 this honourable bounty shall belong
 go to the douglas and deliver him
 up to his pleasure ransomless and free
 his valour shown upon our crests today
 hath taught us how to cherish such high deeds
 even in the bosom of our adversaries
lancaster i thank your grace for this high courtesy
 which i shall give away immediately
