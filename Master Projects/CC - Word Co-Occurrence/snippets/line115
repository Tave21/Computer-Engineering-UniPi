yea many people and strong nations shall come to seek the lord of hosts in jerusalem and to pray before the lord
thus saith the lord of hosts in those days it shall come to pass that ten men shall take hold out of all languages of the nations even shall take hold of the skirt of him that is a jew saying we will go with you for we have heard that god is with you
the burden of the word of the lord in the land of hadrach and damascus shall be the rest thereof when the eyes of man as of all the tribes of israel shall be toward the lord
and hamath also shall border thereby tyrus and zidon though it be very wise
and tyrus did build herself a strong hold and heaped up silver as the dust and fine gold as the mire of the streets
behold the lord will cast her out and he will smite her power in the sea and she shall be devoured with fire
ashkelon shall see it and fear gaza also shall see it and be very sorrowful and ekron for her expectation shall be ashamed and the king shall perish from gaza and ashkelon shall not be inhabited
and a bastard shall dwell in ashdod and i will cut off the pride of the philistines
and i will take away his blood out of his mouth and his abominations from between his teeth but he that remaineth even he shall be for our god and he shall be as a governor in judah and ekron as a jebusite
and i will encamp about mine house because of the army because of him that passeth by and because of him that returneth and no oppressor shall pass through them any more for now have i seen with mine eyes
rejoice greatly o daughter of zion shout o daughter of jerusalem behold thy king cometh unto thee he is just and having salvation lowly and riding upon an ass and upon a colt the foal of an ass
and i will cut off the chariot from ephraim and the horse from jerusalem and the battle bow shall be cut off and he shall speak peace unto the heathen and his dominion shall be from sea even to sea and from the river even to the ends of the earth
as for thee also by the blood of thy covenant i have sent forth thy prisoners out of the pit wherein is no water
turn you to the strong hold ye prisoners of hope even to day do i declare that i will render double unto thee
when i have bent judah for me filled the bow with ephraim and raised up thy sons o zion against thy sons o greece and made thee as the sword of a mighty man
and the lord shall be seen over them and his arrow shall go forth as the lightning and the lord god shall blow the trumpet and shall go with whirlwinds of the south
the lord of hosts shall defend them and they shall devour and subdue with sling stones and they shall drink and make a noise as through wine and they shall be filled like bowls and as the corners of the altar
and the lord their god shall save them in that day as the flock of his people for they shall be as the stones of a crown lifted up as an ensign upon his land
for how great is his goodness and how great is his beauty corn shall make the young men cheerful and new wine the maids
ask ye of the lord rain in the time of the latter rain so the lord shall make bright clouds and give them showers of rain to every one grass in the field
for the idols have spoken vanity and the diviners have seen a lie and have told false dreams they comfort in vain therefore they went their way as a flock they were troubled because there was no shepherd
mine anger was kindled against the shepherds and i punished the goats for the lord of hosts hath visited his flock the house of judah and hath made them as his goodly horse in the battle
out of him came forth the corner out of him the nail out of him the battle bow out of him every oppressor together
and they shall be as mighty men which tread down their enemies in the mire of the streets in the battle and they shall fight because the lord is with them and the riders on horses shall be confounded
and i will strengthen the house of judah and i will save the house of joseph and i will bring them again to place them for i have mercy upon them and they shall be as though i had not cast them off for i am the lord their god and will hear them
and they of ephraim shall be like a mighty man and their heart shall rejoice as through wine yea their children shall see it and be glad their heart shall rejoice in the lord
i will hiss for them and gather them for i have redeemed them and they shall increase as they have increased
and i will sow them among the people and they shall remember me in far countries and they shall live with their children and turn again
i will bring them again also out of the land of egypt and gather them out of assyria and i will bring them into the land of gilead and lebanon and place shall not be found for them
and he shall pass through the sea with affliction and shall smite the waves in the sea and all the deeps of the river shall dry up and the pride of assyria shall be brought down and the sceptre of egypt shall depart away
and i will strengthen them in the lord and they shall walk up and down in his name saith the lord
open thy doors o lebanon that the fire may devour thy cedars
howl fir tree for the cedar is fallen because the mighty are spoiled howl o ye oaks of bashan for the forest of the vintage is come down
there is a voice of the howling of the shepherds for their glory is spoiled a voice of the roaring of young lions for the pride of jordan is spoiled
thus saith the lord my god feed the flock of the slaughter
whose possessors slay them and hold themselves not guilty and they that sell them say blessed be the lord for i am rich and their own shepherds pity them not
for i will no more pity the inhabitants of the land saith the lord but lo i will deliver the men every one into his neighbour's hand and into the hand of his king and they shall smite the land and out of their hand i will not deliver them
and i will feed the flock of slaughter even you o poor of the flock and i took unto me two staves the one i called beauty and the other i called bands and i fed the flock
three shepherds also i cut off in one month and my soul lothed them and their soul also abhorred me
then said i i will not feed you that that dieth let it die and that that is to be cut off let it be cut off and let the rest eat every one the flesh of another
and i took my staff even beauty and cut it asunder that i might break my covenant which i had made with all the people
and it was broken in that day and so the poor of the flock that waited upon me knew that it was the word of the lord
and i said unto them if ye think good give me my price and if not forbear so they weighed for my price thirty pieces of silver
and the lord said unto me cast it unto the potter a goodly price that i was prised at of them and i took the thirty pieces of silver and cast them to the potter in the house of the lord
then i cut asunder mine other staff even bands that i might break the brotherhood between judah and israel
and the lord said unto me take unto thee yet the instruments of a foolish shepherd
for lo i will raise up a shepherd in the land which shall not visit those that be cut off neither shall seek the young one nor heal that that is broken nor feed that that standeth still but he shall eat the flesh of the fat and tear their claws in pieces
woe to the idol shepherd that leaveth the flock the sword shall be upon his arm and upon his right eye his arm shall be clean dried up and his right eye shall be utterly darkened
the burden of the word of the lord for israel saith the lord which stretcheth forth the heavens and layeth the foundation of the earth and formeth the spirit of man within him
behold i will make jerusalem a cup of trembling unto all the people round about when they shall be in the siege both against judah and against jerusalem
and in that day will i make jerusalem a burdensome stone for all people all that burden themselves with it shall be cut in pieces though all the people of the earth be gathered together against it
in that day saith the lord i will smite every horse with astonishment and his rider with madness and i will open mine eyes upon the house of judah and will smite every horse of the people with blindness
and the governors of judah shall say in their heart the inhabitants of jerusalem shall be my strength in the lord of hosts their god
in that day will i make the governors of judah like an hearth of fire among the wood and like a torch of fire in a sheaf and they shall devour all the people round about on the right hand and on the left and jerusalem shall be inhabited again in her own place even in jerusalem
the lord also shall save the tents of judah first that the glory of the house of david and the glory of the inhabitants of jerusalem do not magnify themselves against judah
in that day shall the lord defend the inhabitants of jerusalem and he that is feeble among them at that day shall be as david and the house of david shall be as god as the angel of the lord before them
and it shall come to pass in that day that i will seek to destroy all the nations that come against jerusalem
and i will pour upon the house of david and upon the inhabitants of jerusalem the spirit of grace and of supplications and they shall look upon me whom they have pierced and they shall mourn for him as one mourneth for his only son and shall be in bitterness for him as one that is in bitterness for his firstborn
in that day shall there be a great mourning in jerusalem as the mourning of hadadrimmon in the valley of megiddon
and the land shall mourn every family apart the family of the house of david apart and their wives apart the family of the house of nathan apart and their wives apart
the family of the house of levi apart and their wives apart the family of shimei apart and their wives apart
all the families that remain every family apart and their wives apart
in that day there shall be a fountain opened to the house of david and to the inhabitants of jerusalem for sin and for uncleanness
and it shall come to pass in that day saith the lord of hosts that i will cut off the names of the idols out of the land and they shall no more be remembered and also i will cause the prophets and the unclean spirit to pass out of the land
and it shall come to pass that when any shall yet prophesy then his father and his mother that begat him shall say unto him thou shalt not live for thou speakest lies in the name of the lord and his father and his mother that begat him shall thrust him through when he prophesieth
and it shall come to pass in that day that the prophets shall be ashamed every one of his vision when he hath prophesied neither shall they wear a rough garment to deceive
but he shall say i am no prophet i am an husbandman for man taught me to keep cattle from my youth
and one shall say unto him what are these wounds in thine hands then he shall answer those with which i was wounded in the house of my friends
awake o sword against my shepherd and against the man that is my fellow saith the lord of hosts smite the shepherd and the sheep shall be scattered and i will turn mine hand upon the little ones
and it shall come to pass that in all the land saith the lord two parts therein shall be cut off and die but the third shall be left therein
and i will bring the third part through the fire and will refine them as silver is refined and will try them as gold is tried they shall call on my name and i will hear them i will say it is my people and they shall say the lord is my god
behold the day of the lord cometh and thy spoil shall be divided in the midst of thee
for i will gather all nations against jerusalem to battle and the city shall be taken and the houses rifled and the women ravished and half of the city shall go forth into captivity and the residue of the people shall not be cut off from the city
then shall the lord go forth and fight against those nations as when he fought in the day of battle
and his feet shall stand in that day upon the mount of olives which is before jerusalem on the east and the mount of olives shall cleave in the midst thereof toward the east and toward the west and there shall be a very great valley and half of the mountain shall remove toward the north and half of it toward the south
and ye shall flee to the valley of the mountains for the valley of the mountains shall reach unto azal yea ye shall flee like as ye fled from before the earthquake in the days of uzziah king of judah and the lord my god shall come and all the saints with thee
and it shall come to pass in that day that the light shall not be clear nor dark
but it shall be one day which shall be known to the lord not day nor night but it shall come to pass that at evening time it shall be light
and it shall be in that day that living waters shall go out from jerusalem half of them toward the former sea and half of them toward the hinder sea in summer and in winter shall it be
and the lord shall be king over all the earth in that day shall there be one lord and his name one
all the land shall be turned as a plain from geba to rimmon south of jerusalem and it shall be lifted up and inhabited in her place from benjamin's gate unto the place of the first gate unto the corner gate and from the tower of hananeel unto the king's winepresses
and men shall dwell in it and there shall be no more utter destruction but jerusalem shall be safely inhabited
and this shall be the plague wherewith the lord will smite all the people that have fought against jerusalem their flesh shall consume away while they stand upon their feet and their eyes shall consume away in their holes and their tongue shall consume away in their mouth
and it shall come to pass in that day that a great tumult from the lord shall be among them and they shall lay hold every one on the hand of his neighbour and his hand shall rise up against the hand of his neighbour
and judah also shall fight at jerusalem and the wealth of all the heathen round about shall be gathered together gold and silver and apparel in great abundance
and so shall be the plague of the horse of the mule of the camel and of the ass and of all the beasts that shall be in these tents as this plague
and it shall come to pass that every one that is left of all the nations which came against jerusalem shall even go up from year to year to worship the king the lord of hosts and to keep the feast of tabernacles
and it shall be that whoso will not come up of all the families of the earth unto jerusalem to worship the king the lord of hosts even upon them shall be no rain
and if the family of egypt go not up and come not that have no rain there shall be the plague wherewith the lord will smite the heathen that come not up to keep the feast of tabernacles
this shall be the punishment of egypt and the punishment of all nations that come not up to keep the feast of tabernacles
in that day shall there be upon the bells of the horses holiness unto the lord and the pots in the lord's house shall be like the bowls before the altar
yea every pot in jerusalem and in judah shall be holiness unto the lord of hosts and all they that sacrifice shall come and take of them and seethe therein and in that day there shall be no more the canaanite in the house of the lord of hosts
the burden of the word of the lord to israel by malachi
i have loved you saith the lord yet ye say wherein hast thou loved us was not esau jacob's brother saith the lord yet i loved jacob
and i hated esau and laid his mountains and his heritage waste for the dragons of the wilderness
whereas edom saith we are impoverished but we will return and build the desolate places thus saith the lord of hosts they shall build but i will throw down and they shall call them the border of wickedness and the people against whom the lord hath indignation for ever
and your eyes shall see and ye shall say the lord will be magnified from the border of israel
a son honoureth his father and a servant his master if then i be a father where is mine honour and if i be a master where is my fear saith the lord of hosts unto you o priests that despise my name and ye say wherein have we despised thy name
ye offer polluted bread upon mine altar and ye say wherein have we polluted thee in that ye say the table of the lord is contemptible
and if ye offer the blind for sacrifice is it not evil and if ye offer the lame and sick is it not evil offer it now unto thy governor will he be pleased with thee or accept thy person saith the lord of hosts
and now i pray you beseech god that he will be gracious unto us this hath been by your means will he regard your persons saith the lord of hosts
who is there even among you that would shut the doors for nought neither do ye kindle fire on mine altar for nought i have no pleasure in you saith the lord of hosts neither will i accept an offering at your hand
for from the rising of the sun even unto the going down of the same my name shall be great among the gentiles and in every place incense shall be offered unto my name and a pure offering for my name shall be great among the heathen saith the lord of hosts
but ye have profaned it in that ye say the table of the lord is polluted and the fruit thereof even his meat is contemptible
ye said also behold what a weariness is it and ye have snuffed at it saith the lord of hosts and ye brought that which was torn and the lame and the sick thus ye brought an offering should i accept this of your hand saith the lord
but cursed be the deceiver which hath in his flock a male and voweth and sacrificeth unto the lord a corrupt thing for i am a great king saith the lord of hosts and my name is dreadful among the heathen
and now o ye priests this commandment is for you
if ye will not hear and if ye will not lay it to heart to give glory unto my name saith the lord of hosts i will even send a curse upon you and i will curse your blessings yea i have cursed them already because ye do not lay it to heart
behold i will corrupt your seed and spread dung upon your faces even the dung of your solemn feasts and one shall take you away with it
and ye shall know that i have sent this commandment unto you that my covenant might be with levi saith the lord of hosts
my covenant was with him of life and peace and i gave them to him for the fear wherewith he feared me and was afraid before my name
the law of truth was in his mouth and iniquity was not found in his lips he walked with me in peace and equity and did turn many away from iniquity
for the priest's lips should keep knowledge and they should seek the law at his mouth for he is the messenger of the lord of hosts
but ye are departed out of the way ye have caused many to stumble at the law ye have corrupted the covenant of levi saith the lord of hosts
therefore have i also made you contemptible and base before all the people according as ye have not kept my ways but have been partial in the law
have we not all one father hath not one god created us why do we deal treacherously every man against his brother by profaning the covenant of our fathers
judah hath dealt treacherously and an abomination is committed in israel and in jerusalem for judah hath profaned the holiness of the lord which he loved and hath married the daughter of a strange god
the lord will cut off the man that doeth this the master and the scholar out of the tabernacles of jacob and him that offereth an offering unto the lord of hosts
and this have ye done again covering the altar of the lord with tears with weeping and with crying out insomuch that he regardeth not the offering any more or receiveth it with good will at your hand
yet ye say wherefore because the lord hath been witness between thee and the wife of thy youth against whom thou hast dealt treacherously yet is she thy companion and the wife of thy covenant
and did not he make one yet had he the residue of the spirit and wherefore one that he might seek a godly seed therefore take heed to your spirit and let none deal treacherously against the wife of his youth
for the lord the god of israel saith that he hateth putting away for one covereth violence with his garment saith the lord of hosts therefore take heed to your spirit that ye deal not treacherously
ye have wearied the lord with your words yet ye say wherein have we wearied him when ye say every one that doeth evil is good in the sight of the lord and he delighteth in them or where is the god of judgment
behold i will send my messenger and he shall prepare the way before me and the lord whom ye seek shall suddenly come to his temple even the messenger of the covenant whom ye delight in behold he shall come saith the lord of hosts
but who may abide the day of his coming and who shall stand when he appeareth for he is like a refiner's fire and like fullers soap
and he shall sit as a refiner and purifier of silver and he shall purify the sons of levi and purge them as gold and silver that they may offer unto the lord an offering in righteousness
then shall the offering of judah and jerusalem be pleasant unto the lord as in the days of old and as in former years
and i will come near to you to judgment and i will be a swift witness against the sorcerers and against the adulterers and against false swearers and against those that oppress the hireling in his wages the widow and the fatherless and that turn aside the stranger from his right and fear not me saith the lord of hosts
for i am the lord i change not therefore ye sons of jacob are not consumed
even from the days of your fathers ye are gone away from mine ordinances and have not kept them return unto me and i will return unto you saith the lord of hosts but ye said wherein shall we return
will a man rob god yet ye have robbed me but ye say wherein have we robbed thee in tithes and offerings
ye are cursed with a curse for ye have robbed me even this whole nation
bring ye all the tithes into the storehouse that there may be meat in mine house and prove me now herewith saith the lord of hosts if i will not open you the windows of heaven and pour you out a blessing that there shall not be room enough to receive it
and i will rebuke the devourer for your sakes and he shall not destroy the fruits of your ground neither shall your vine cast her fruit before the time in the field saith the lord of hosts
and all nations shall call you blessed for ye shall be a delightsome land saith the lord of hosts
your words have been stout against me saith the lord yet ye say what have we spoken so much against thee
ye have said it is vain to serve god and what profit is it that we have kept his ordinance and that we have walked mournfully before the lord of hosts
and now we call the proud happy yea they that work wickedness are set up yea they that tempt god are even delivered
then they that feared the lord spake often one to another and the lord hearkened and heard it and a book of remembrance was written before him for them that feared the lord and that thought upon his name
and they shall be mine saith the lord of hosts in that day when i make up my jewels and i will spare them as a man spareth his own son that serveth him
then shall ye return and discern between the righteous and the wicked between him that serveth god and him that serveth him not
for behold the day cometh that shall burn as an oven and all the proud yea and all that do wickedly shall be stubble and the day that cometh shall burn them up saith the lord of hosts that it shall leave them neither root nor branch
but unto you that fear my name shall the sun of righteousness arise with healing in his wings and ye shall go forth and grow up as calves of the stall
and ye shall tread down the wicked for they shall be ashes under the soles of your feet in the day that i shall do this saith the lord of hosts
remember ye the law of moses my servant which i commanded unto him in horeb for all israel with the statutes and judgments
behold i will send you elijah the prophet before the coming of the great and dreadful day of the lord
and he shall turn the heart of the fathers to the children and the heart of the children to their fathers lest i come and smite the earth with a curse
the book of the generation of jesus christ the son of david the son of abraham
abraham begat isaac and isaac begat jacob and jacob begat judas and his brethren
and judas begat phares and zara of thamar and phares begat esrom and esrom begat aram
and aram begat aminadab and aminadab begat naasson and naasson begat salmon
and salmon begat booz of rachab and booz begat obed of ruth and obed begat jesse
and jesse begat david the king and david the king begat solomon of her that had been the wife of urias
and solomon begat roboam and roboam begat abia and abia begat asa
and asa begat josaphat and josaphat begat joram and joram begat ozias
and ozias begat joatham and joatham begat achaz and achaz begat ezekias
and ezekias begat manasses and manasses begat amon and amon begat josias
and josias begat jechonias and his brethren about the time they were carried away to babylon
and after they were brought to babylon jechonias begat salathiel and salathiel begat zorobabel
and zorobabel begat abiud and abiud begat eliakim and eliakim begat azor
and azor begat sadoc and sadoc begat achim and achim begat eliud
and eliud begat eleazar and eleazar begat matthan and matthan begat jacob
and jacob begat joseph the husband of mary of whom was born jesus who is called christ
so all the generations from abraham to david are fourteen generations and from david until the carrying away into babylon are fourteen generations and from the carrying away into babylon unto christ are fourteen generations
now the birth of jesus christ was on this wise when as his mother mary was espoused to joseph before they came together she was found with child of the holy ghost
then joseph her husband being a just man and not willing to make her a publick example was minded to put her away privily
but while he thought on these things behold the angel of the lord appeared unto him in a dream saying joseph thou son of david fear not to take unto thee mary thy wife for that which is conceived in her is of the holy ghost
and she shall bring forth a son and thou shalt call his name jesus for he shall save his people from their sins
now all this was done that it might be fulfilled which was spoken of the lord by the prophet saying
behold a virgin shall be with child and shall bring forth a son and they shall call his name emmanuel which being interpreted is god with us
then joseph being raised from sleep did as the angel of the lord had bidden him and took unto him his wife
and knew her not till she had brought forth her firstborn son and he called his name jesus
now when jesus was born in bethlehem of judaea in the days of herod the king behold there came wise men from the east to jerusalem
saying where is he that is born king of the jews for we have seen his star in the east and are come to worship him
when herod the king had heard these things he was troubled and all jerusalem with him
and when he had gathered all the chief priests and scribes of the people together he demanded of them where christ should be born
and they said unto him in bethlehem of judaea for thus it is written by the prophet
and thou bethlehem in the land of juda art not the least among the princes of juda for out of thee shall come a governor that shall rule my people israel
then herod when he had privily called the wise men enquired of them diligently what time the star appeared
and he sent them to bethlehem and said go and search diligently for the young child and when ye have found him bring me word again that i may come and worship him also
when they had heard the king they departed and lo the star which they saw in the east went before them till it came and stood over where the young child was
when they saw the star they rejoiced with exceeding great joy
and when they were come into the house they saw the young child with mary his mother and fell down and worshipped him and when they had opened their treasures they presented unto him gifts gold and frankincense and myrrh
and being warned of god in a dream that they should not return to herod they departed into their own country another way
and when they were departed behold the angel of the lord appeareth to joseph in a dream saying arise and take the young child and his mother and flee into egypt and be thou there until i bring thee word for herod will seek the young child to destroy him
when he arose he took the young child and his mother by night and departed into egypt
and was there until the death of herod that it might be fulfilled which was spoken of the lord by the prophet saying out of egypt have i called my son
then herod when he saw that he was mocked of the wise men was exceeding wroth and sent forth and slew all the children that were in bethlehem and in all the coasts thereof from two years old and under according to the time which he had diligently enquired of the wise men
then was fulfilled that which was spoken by jeremy the prophet saying
in rama was there a voice heard lamentation and weeping and great mourning rachel weeping for her children and would not be comforted because they are not
but when herod was dead behold an angel of the lord appeareth in a dream to joseph in egypt
saying arise and take the young child and his mother and go into the land of israel for they are dead which sought the young child's life
and he arose and took the young child and his mother and came into the land of israel
but when he heard that archelaus did reign in judaea in the room of his father herod he was afraid to go thither notwithstanding being warned of god in a dream he turned aside into the parts of galilee
and he came and dwelt in a city called nazareth that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophets he shall be called a nazarene
in those days came john the baptist preaching in the wilderness of judaea
and saying repent ye for the kingdom of heaven is at hand
for this is he that was spoken of by the prophet esaias saying the voice of one crying in the wilderness prepare ye the way of the lord make his paths straight
and the same john had his raiment of camel's hair and a leathern girdle about his loins and his meat was locusts and wild honey
then went out to him jerusalem and all judaea and all the region round about jordan
