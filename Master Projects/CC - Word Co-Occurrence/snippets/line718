 before him the axe with the edge towards him
 halberds on each side accompanied with lovell
 vaux sands and common people
second gentleman let's stand close and behold him
buckingham all good people
 you that thus far have come to pity me
 hear what i say and then go home and lose me
 i have this day received a traitor's judgment
 and by that name must die yet heaven bear witness
 and if i have a conscience let it sink me
 even as the axe falls if i be not faithful
 the law i bear no malice for my death
 t has done upon the premises but justice
 but those that sought it i could wish more christians
 be what they will i heartily forgive em
 yet let em look they glory not in mischief
 nor build their evils on the graves of great men
 for then my guiltless blood must cry against em
 for further life in this world i ne'er hope
 nor will i sue although the king have mercies
 more than i dare make faults you few that loved me
 and dare be bold to weep for buckingham
 his noble friends and fellows whom to leave
 is only bitter to him only dying
 go with me like good angels to my end
 and as the long divorce of steel falls on me
 make of your prayers one sweet sacrifice
 and lift my soul to heaven lead on o god's name
lovell i do beseech your grace for charity
 if ever any malice in your heart
 were hid against me now to forgive me frankly
buckingham sir thomas lovell i as free forgive you
 as i would be forgiven i forgive all
 there cannot be those numberless offences
 gainst me that i cannot take peace with
 no black envy
 shall mark my grave commend me to his grace
 and if he speak of buckingham pray tell him
 you met him half in heaven my vows and prayers
 yet are the king's and till my soul forsake
 shall cry for blessings on him may he live
 longer than i have time to tell his years
 ever beloved and loving may his rule be
 and when old time shall lead him to his end
 goodness and he fill up one monument
lovell to the water side i must conduct your grace
 then give my charge up to sir nicholas vaux
 who undertakes you to your end
vaux prepare there
 the duke is coming see the barge be ready
 and fit it with such furniture as suits
 the greatness of his person
buckingham nay sir nicholas
 let it alone my state now will but mock me
 when i came hither i was lord high constable
 and duke of buckingham now poor edward bohun
 yet i am richer than my base accusers
 that never knew what truth meant i now seal it
 and with that blood will make em one day groan for't
 my noble father henry of buckingham
 who first raised head against usurping richard
 flying for succor to his servant banister
 being distress'd was by that wretch betray'd
 and without trial fell god's peace be with him
 henry the seventh succeeding truly pitying
 my father's loss like a most royal prince
 restored me to my honours and out of ruins
 made my name once more noble now his son
 henry the eighth life honour name and all
 that made me happy at one stroke has taken
 for ever from the world i had my trial
 and must needs say a noble one which makes me
 a little happier than my wretched father
 yet thus far we are one in fortunes both
 fell by our servants by those men we loved most
 a most unnatural and faithless service
 heaven has an end in all yet you that hear me
 this from a dying man receive as certain
 where you are liberal of your loves and counsels
 be sure you be not loose for those you make friends
 and give your hearts to when they once perceive
 the least rub in your fortunes fall away
 like water from ye never found again
 but where they mean to sink ye all good people
 pray for me i must now forsake ye the last hour
 of my long weary life is come upon me farewell
 and when you would say something that is sad
 speak how i fell i have done and god forgive me
 exeunt buckingham and train
first gentleman o this is full of pity sir it calls
 i fear too many curses on their beads
 that were the authors
second gentleman if the duke be guiltless
 tis full of woe yet i can give you inkling
 of an ensuing evil if it fall
 greater than this
first gentleman good angels keep it from us
 what may it be you do not doubt my faith sir
second gentleman this secret is so weighty twill require
 a strong faith to conceal it
first gentleman let me have it
 i do not talk much
second gentleman i am confident
 you shall sir did you not of late days hear
 a buzzing of a separation
 between the king and katharine
first gentleman yes but it held not
 for when the king once heard it out of anger
 he sent command to the lord mayor straight
 to stop the rumor and allay those tongues
 that durst disperse it
second gentleman but that slander sir
 is found a truth now for it grows again
 fresher than e'er it was and held for certain
 the king will venture at it either the cardinal
 or some about him near have out of malice
 to the good queen possess'd him with a scruple
 that will undo her to confirm this too
 cardinal campeius is arrived and lately
 as all think for this business
first gentleman tis the cardinal
 and merely to revenge him on the emperor
 for not bestowing on him at his asking
 the archbishopric of toledo this is purposed
second gentleman i think you have hit the mark but is't not cruel
 that she should feel the smart of this the cardinal
 will have his will and she must fall
first gentleman tis woful
 we are too open here to argue this
 let's think in private more
 exeunt
 king henry viii
act ii
scene ii an antechamber in the palace
 enter chamberlain reading a letter
chamberlain my lord the horses your lordship sent for with
 all the care i had i saw well chosen ridden and
 furnished they were young and handsome and of the
 best breed in the north when they were ready to
 set out for london a man of my lord cardinal's by
 commission and main power took em from me with
 this reason his master would be served before a
 subject if not before the king which stopped our
 mouths sir'
 i fear he will indeed well let him have them
 he will have all i think
 enter to chamberlain norfolk and suffolk
norfolk well met my lord chamberlain
chamberlain good day to both your graces
suffolk how is the king employ'd
chamberlain i left him private
 full of sad thoughts and troubles
norfolk what's the cause
chamberlain it seems the marriage with his brother's wife
 has crept too near his conscience
suffolk no his conscience
 has crept too near another lady
norfolk tis so
 this is the cardinal's doing the kingcardinal
 that blind priest like the eldest son of fortune
 turns what he list the king will know him one day
suffolk pray god he do he'll never know himself else
norfolk how holily he works in all his business
 and with what zeal for now he has crack'd the league
 between us and the emperor the queen's great nephew
 he dives into the king's soul and there scatters
 dangers doubts wringing of the conscience
 fears and despairs and all these for his marriage
 and out of all these to restore the king
 he counsels a divorce a loss of her
 that like a jewel has hung twenty years
 about his neck yet never lost her lustre
 of her that loves him with that excellence
 that angels love good men with even of her
 that when the greatest stroke of fortune falls
 will bless the king and is not this course pious
chamberlain heaven keep me from such counsel tis most true
 these news are every where every tongue speaks em
 and every true heart weeps for't all that dare
 look into these affairs see this main end
 the french king's sister heaven will one day open
 the king's eyes that so long have slept upon
 this bold bad man
suffolk and free us from his slavery
norfolk we had need pray
 and heartily for our deliverance
 or this imperious man will work us all
 from princes into pages all men's honours
 lie like one lump before him to be fashion'd
 into what pitch he please
suffolk for me my lords
 i love him not nor fear him there's my creed
 as i am made without him so i'll stand
 if the king please his curses and his blessings
 touch me alike they're breath i not believe in
 i knew him and i know him so i leave him
 to him that made him proud the pope
norfolk let's in
 and with some other business put the king
 from these sad thoughts that work too much upon him
