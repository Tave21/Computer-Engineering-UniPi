by the rivers of babylon there we sat down yea we wept when we remembered zion
we hanged our harps upon the willows in the midst thereof
for there they that carried us away captive required of us a song and they that wasted us required of us mirth saying sing us one of the songs of zion
how shall we sing the lord's song in a strange land
if i forget thee o jerusalem let my right hand forget her cunning
if i do not remember thee let my tongue cleave to the roof of my mouth if i prefer not jerusalem above my chief joy
remember o lord the children of edom in the day of jerusalem who said rase it rase it even to the foundation thereof
o daughter of babylon who art to be destroyed happy shall he be that rewardeth thee as thou hast served us
happy shall he be that taketh and dasheth thy little ones against the stones
i will praise thee with my whole heart before the gods will i sing praise unto thee
i will worship toward thy holy temple and praise thy name for thy lovingkindness and for thy truth for thou hast magnified thy word above all thy name
in the day when i cried thou answeredst me and strengthenedst me with strength in my soul
all the kings of the earth shall praise thee o lord when they hear the words of thy mouth
yea they shall sing in the ways of the lord for great is the glory of the lord
though the lord be high yet hath he respect unto the lowly but the proud he knoweth afar off
though i walk in the midst of trouble thou wilt revive me thou shalt stretch forth thine hand against the wrath of mine enemies and thy right hand shall save me
the lord will perfect that which concerneth me thy mercy o lord endureth for ever forsake not the works of thine own hands
o lord thou hast searched me and known me
thou knowest my downsitting and mine uprising thou understandest my thought afar off
thou compassest my path and my lying down and art acquainted with all my ways
for there is not a word in my tongue but lo o lord thou knowest it altogether
thou hast beset me behind and before and laid thine hand upon me
such knowledge is too wonderful for me it is high i cannot attain unto it
whither shall i go from thy spirit or whither shall i flee from thy presence
if i ascend up into heaven thou art there if i make my bed in hell behold thou art there
if i take the wings of the morning and dwell in the uttermost parts of the sea
even there shall thy hand lead me and thy right hand shall hold me
if i say surely the darkness shall cover me even the night shall be light about me
yea the darkness hideth not from thee but the night shineth as the day the darkness and the light are both alike to thee
for thou hast possessed my reins thou hast covered me in my mother's womb
i will praise thee for i am fearfully and wonderfully made marvellous are thy works and that my soul knoweth right well
my substance was not hid from thee when i was made in secret and curiously wrought in the lowest parts of the earth
thine eyes did see my substance yet being unperfect and in thy book all my members were written which in continuance were fashioned when as yet there was none of them
how precious also are thy thoughts unto me o god how great is the sum of them
if i should count them they are more in number than the sand when i awake i am still with thee
surely thou wilt slay the wicked o god depart from me therefore ye bloody men
for they speak against thee wickedly and thine enemies take thy name in vain
do not i hate them o lord that hate thee and am not i grieved with those that rise up against thee
i hate them with perfect hatred i count them mine enemies
search me o god and know my heart try me and know my thoughts
and see if there be any wicked way in me and lead me in the way everlasting
deliver me o lord from the evil man preserve me from the violent man
which imagine mischiefs in their heart continually are they gathered together for war
they have sharpened their tongues like a serpent adders poison is under their lips selah
keep me o lord from the hands of the wicked preserve me from the violent man who have purposed to overthrow my goings
the proud have hid a snare for me and cords they have spread a net by the wayside they have set gins for me selah
i said unto the lord thou art my god hear the voice of my supplications o lord
o god the lord the strength of my salvation thou hast covered my head in the day of battle
grant not o lord the desires of the wicked further not his wicked device lest they exalt themselves selah
as for the head of those that compass me about let the mischief of their own lips cover them
let burning coals fall upon them let them be cast into the fire into deep pits that they rise not up again
let not an evil speaker be established in the earth evil shall hunt the violent man to overthrow him
i know that the lord will maintain the cause of the afflicted and the right of the poor
surely the righteous shall give thanks unto thy name the upright shall dwell in thy presence
lord i cry unto thee make haste unto me give ear unto my voice when i cry unto thee
let my prayer be set forth before thee as incense and the lifting up of my hands as the evening sacrifice
set a watch o lord before my mouth keep the door of my lips
incline not my heart to any evil thing to practise wicked works with men that work iniquity and let me not eat of their dainties
let the righteous smite me it shall be a kindness and let him reprove me it shall be an excellent oil which shall not break my head for yet my prayer also shall be in their calamities
when their judges are overthrown in stony places they shall hear my words for they are sweet
our bones are scattered at the grave's mouth as when one cutteth and cleaveth wood upon the earth
but mine eyes are unto thee o god the lord in thee is my trust leave not my soul destitute
keep me from the snares which they have laid for me and the gins of the workers of iniquity
let the wicked fall into their own nets whilst that i withal escape
i cried unto the lord with my voice with my voice unto the lord did i make my supplication
i poured out my complaint before him i shewed before him my trouble
when my spirit was overwhelmed within me then thou knewest my path in the way wherein i walked have they privily laid a snare for me
i looked on my right hand and beheld but there was no man that would know me refuge failed me no man cared for my soul
i cried unto thee o lord i said thou art my refuge and my portion in the land of the living
attend unto my cry for i am brought very low deliver me from my persecutors for they are stronger than i
bring my soul out of prison that i may praise thy name the righteous shall compass me about for thou shalt deal bountifully with me
hear my prayer o lord give ear to my supplications in thy faithfulness answer me and in thy righteousness
and enter not into judgment with thy servant for in thy sight shall no man living be justified
for the enemy hath persecuted my soul he hath smitten my life down to the ground he hath made me to dwell in darkness as those that have been long dead
therefore is my spirit overwhelmed within me my heart within me is desolate
i remember the days of old i meditate on all thy works i muse on the work of thy hands
i stretch forth my hands unto thee my soul thirsteth after thee as a thirsty land selah
hear me speedily o lord my spirit faileth hide not thy face from me lest i be like unto them that go down into the pit
cause me to hear thy lovingkindness in the morning for in thee do i trust cause me to know the way wherein i should walk for i lift up my soul unto thee
deliver me o lord from mine enemies i flee unto thee to hide me
teach me to do thy will for thou art my god thy spirit is good lead me into the land of uprightness
quicken me o lord for thy name's sake for thy righteousness sake bring my soul out of trouble
and of thy mercy cut off mine enemies and destroy all them that afflict my soul for i am thy servant
blessed be the lord my strength which teacheth my hands to war and my fingers to fight
my goodness and my fortress my high tower and my deliverer my shield and he in whom i trust who subdueth my people under me
lord what is man that thou takest knowledge of him or the son of man that thou makest account of him
man is like to vanity his days are as a shadow that passeth away
bow thy heavens o lord and come down touch the mountains and they shall smoke
cast forth lightning and scatter them shoot out thine arrows and destroy them
send thine hand from above rid me and deliver me out of great waters from the hand of strange children
whose mouth speaketh vanity and their right hand is a right hand of falsehood
i will sing a new song unto thee o god upon a psaltery and an instrument of ten strings will i sing praises unto thee
it is he that giveth salvation unto kings who delivereth david his servant from the hurtful sword
rid me and deliver me from the hand of strange children whose mouth speaketh vanity and their right hand is a right hand of falsehood
that our sons may be as plants grown up in their youth that our daughters may be as corner stones polished after the similitude of a palace
that our garners may be full affording all manner of store that our sheep may bring forth thousands and ten thousands in our streets
that our oxen may be strong to labour that there be no breaking in nor going out that there be no complaining in our streets
