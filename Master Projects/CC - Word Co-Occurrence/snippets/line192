 than violentest contrariety
 enter a second messenger
second messenger you are sent for to the senate
 a fearful army led by caius marcius
 associated with aufidius rages
 upon our territories and have already
 o'erborne their way consumed with fire and took
 what lay before them
 enter cominius
cominius o you have made good work
menenius what news what news
cominius you have holp to ravish your own daughters and
 to melt the city leads upon your pates
 to see your wives dishonour'd to your noses
menenius what's the news what's the news
cominius your temples burned in their cement and
 your franchises whereon you stood confined
 into an auger's bore
menenius pray now your news
 you have made fair work i fear mepray your news
 if marcius should be join'd with volscians
cominius if
 he is their god he leads them like a thing
 made by some other deity than nature
 that shapes man better and they follow him
 against us brats with no less confidence
 than boys pursuing summer butterflies
 or butchers killing flies
menenius you have made good work
 you and your apronmen you that stood so up much
 on the voice of occupation and
 the breath of garliceaters
cominius he will shake
 your rome about your ears
menenius as hercules
 did shake down mellow fruit
 you have made fair work
brutus but is this true sir
cominius ay and you'll look pale
 before you find it other all the regions
 do smilingly revolt and who resist
 are mock'd for valiant ignorance
 and perish constant fools who is't can blame him
 your enemies and his find something in him
menenius we are all undone unless
 the noble man have mercy
cominius who shall ask it
 the tribunes cannot do't for shame the people
 deserve such pity of him as the wolf
 does of the shepherds for his best friends if they
 should say be good to rome they charged him even
 as those should do that had deserved his hate
 and therein show'd like enemies
menenius tis true
 if he were putting to my house the brand
 that should consume it i have not the face
 to say beseech you cease you have made fair hands
 you and your crafts you have crafted fair
cominius you have brought
 a trembling upon rome such as was never
 so incapable of help
both tribunes say not we brought it
menenius how was it we we loved him but like beasts
 and cowardly nobles gave way unto your clusters
 who did hoot him out o the city
cominius but i fear
 they'll roar him in again tullus aufidius
 the second name of men obeys his points
 as if he were his officer desperation
 is all the policy strength and defence
 that rome can make against them
 enter a troop of citizens
menenius here come the clusters
 and is aufidius with him you are they
 that made the air unwholesome when you cast
 your stinking greasy caps in hooting at
 coriolanus exile now he's coming
 and not a hair upon a soldier's head
 which will not prove a whip as many coxcombs
 as you threw caps up will he tumble down
 and pay you for your voices tis no matter
 if he could burn us all into one coal
 we have deserved it
citizens faith we hear fearful news
first citizen for mine own part
 when i said banish him i said twas pity
second citizen and so did i
third citizen and so did i and to say the truth so did very
 many of us that we did we did for the best and
 though we willingly consented to his banishment yet
 it was against our will
cominius ye re goodly things you voices
menenius you have made
 good work you and your cry shall's to the capitol
cominius o ay what else
 exeunt cominius and menenius
sicinius go masters get you home be not dismay'd
 these are a side that would be glad to have
 this true which they so seem to fear go home
 and show no sign of fear
first citizen the gods be good to us come masters let's home
 i ever said we were i the wrong when we banished
 him
second citizen so did we all but come let's home
 exeunt citizens
brutus i do not like this news
sicinius nor i
brutus let's to the capitol would half my wealth
 would buy this for a lie
sicinius pray let us go
 exeunt
 coriolanus
act iv
scene vii a camp at a small distance from rome
 enter aufidius and his lieutenant
aufidius do they still fly to the roman
lieutenant i do not know what witchcraft's in him but
 your soldiers use him as the grace fore meat
 their talk at table and their thanks at end
 and you are darken'd in this action sir
 even by your own
aufidius i cannot help it now
 unless by using means i lame the foot
 of our design he bears himself more proudlier
 even to my person than i thought he would
 when first i did embrace him yet his nature
 in that's no changeling and i must excuse
 what cannot be amended
lieutenant yet i wish sir
 i mean for your particularyou had not
 join'd in commission with him but either
 had borne the action of yourself or else
 to him had left it solely
aufidius i understand thee well and be thou sure
 when he shall come to his account he knows not
 what i can urge against him although it seems
 and so he thinks and is no less apparent
 to the vulgar eye that he bears all things fairly
 and shows good husbandry for the volscian state
 fights dragonlike and does achieve as soon
 as draw his sword yet he hath left undone
 that which shall break his neck or hazard mine
 whene'er we come to our account
lieutenant sir i beseech you think you he'll carry rome
aufidius all places yield to him ere he sits down
 and the nobility of rome are his
 the senators and patricians love him too
 the tribunes are no soldiers and their people
 will be as rash in the repeal as hasty
 to expel him thence i think he'll be to rome
 as is the osprey to the fish who takes it
 by sovereignty of nature first he was
 a noble servant to them but he could not
 carry his honours even whether twas pride
 which out of daily fortune ever taints
 the happy man whether defect of judgment
 to fail in the disposing of those chances
 which he was lord of or whether nature
 not to be other than one thing not moving
 from the casque to the cushion but commanding peace
 even with the same austerity and garb
 as he controll'd the war but one of these
 as he hath spices of them all not all
 for i dare so far free himmade him fear'd
 so hated and so banish'd but he has a merit
 to choke it in the utterance so our virtues
 lie in the interpretation of the time
 and power unto itself most commendable
 hath not a tomb so evident as a chair
 to extol what it hath done
 one fire drives out one fire one nail one nail
 rights by rights falter strengths by strengths do fail
 come let's away when caius rome is thine
 thou art poor'st of all then shortly art thou mine
 exeunt
 coriolanus
act v
scene i rome a public place
 enter menenius cominius sicinius brutus
 and others
menenius no i'll not go you hear what he hath said
 which was sometime his general who loved him
 in a most dear particular he call'd me father
 but what o that go you that banish'd him
 a mile before his tent fall down and knee
 the way into his mercy nay if he coy'd
 to hear cominius speak i'll keep at home
cominius he would not seem to know me
menenius do you hear
cominius yet one time he did call me by my name
 i urged our old acquaintance and the drops
 that we have bled together coriolanus
 he would not answer to forbad all names
 he was a kind of nothing titleless
 till he had forged himself a name o the fire
 of burning rome
menenius why so you have made good work
 a pair of tribunes that have rack'd for rome
 to make coals cheapa noble memory
cominius i minded him how royal twas to pardon
