alonso not i
gonzalo faith sir you need not fear when we were boys
 who would believe that there were mountaineers
 dewlapp'd like bulls whose throats had hanging at em
 wallets of flesh or that there were such men
 whose heads stood in their breasts which now we find
 each putterout of five for one will bring us
 good warrant of
alonso i will stand to and feed
 although my last no matter since i feel
 the best is past brother my lord the duke
 stand to and do as we
 thunder and lightning enter ariel like a
 harpy claps his wings upon the table and
 with a quaint device the banquet vanishes
ariel you are three men of sin whom destiny
 that hath to instrument this lower world
 and what is in't the neversurfeited sea
 hath caused to belch up you and on this island
 where man doth not inhabit you mongst men
 being most unfit to live i have made you mad
 and even with suchlike valour men hang and drown
 their proper selves
 alonso sebastian &c draw their swords
 you fools i and my fellows
 are ministers of fate the elements
 of whom your swords are temper'd may as well
 wound the loud winds or with bemock'dat stabs
 kill the stillclosing waters as diminish
 one dowle that's in my plume my fellowministers
 are like invulnerable if you could hurt
 your swords are now too massy for your strengths
 and will not be uplifted but remember
 for that's my business to youthat you three
 from milan did supplant good prospero
 exposed unto the sea which hath requit it
 him and his innocent child for which foul deed
 the powers delaying not forgetting have
 incensed the seas and shores yea all the creatures
 against your peace thee of thy son alonso
 they have bereft and do pronounce by me
 lingering perdition worse than any death
 can be at once shall step by step attend
 you and your ways whose wraths to guard you from
 which here in this most desolate isle else falls
 upon your headsis nothing but heartsorrow
 and a clear life ensuing
 he vanishes in thunder then to soft music
 enter the shapes again and dance with
 mocks and mows and carrying out the table
prospero bravely the figure of this harpy hast thou
 perform'd my ariel a grace it had devouring
 of my instruction hast thou nothing bated
 in what thou hadst to say so with good life
 and observation strange my meaner ministers
 their several kinds have done my high charms work
 and these mine enemies are all knit up
 in their distractions they now are in my power
 and in these fits i leave them while i visit
 young ferdinand whom they suppose is drown'd
 and his and mine loved darling
 exit above
gonzalo i the name of something holy sir why stand you
 in this strange stare
alonso o it is monstrous monstrous
 methought the billows spoke and told me of it
 the winds did sing it to me and the thunder
 that deep and dreadful organpipe pronounced
 the name of prosper it did bass my trespass
 therefore my son i the ooze is bedded and
 i'll seek him deeper than e'er plummet sounded
 and with him there lie mudded
 exit
sebastian but one fiend at a time
 i'll fight their legions o'er
antonio i'll be thy second
 exeunt sebastian and antonio
gonzalo all three of them are desperate their great guilt
 like poison given to work a great time after
 now gins to bite the spirits i do beseech you
 that are of suppler joints follow them swiftly
 and hinder them from what this ecstasy
 may now provoke them to
adrian follow i pray you
 exeunt
 the tempest
act iv
scene i before prospero's cell
 enter prospero ferdinand and miranda
prospero if i have too austerely punish'd you
 your compensation makes amends for i
 have given you here a third of mine own life
 or that for which i live who once again
 i tender to thy hand all thy vexations
 were but my trials of thy love and thou
 hast strangely stood the test here afore heaven
 i ratify this my rich gift o ferdinand
 do not smile at me that i boast her off
 for thou shalt find she will outstrip all praise
 and make it halt behind her
ferdinand i do believe it
 against an oracle
prospero then as my gift and thine own acquisition
 worthily purchased take my daughter but
 if thou dost break her virginknot before
 all sanctimonious ceremonies may
 with full and holy rite be minister'd
 no sweet aspersion shall the heavens let fall
 to make this contract grow but barren hate
 soureyed disdain and discord shall bestrew
 the union of your bed with weeds so loathly
 that you shall hate it both therefore take heed
 as hymen's lamps shall light you
ferdinand as i hope
 for quiet days fair issue and long life
 with such love as tis now the murkiest den
 the most opportune place the strong'st suggestion
 our worser genius can shall never melt
 mine honour into lust to take away
 the edge of that day's celebration
 when i shall think or phoebus steeds are founder'd
 or night kept chain'd below
prospero fairly spoke
 sit then and talk with her she is thine own
 what ariel my industrious servant ariel
 enter ariel
ariel what would my potent master here i am
prospero thou and thy meaner fellows your last service
 did worthily perform and i must use you
 in such another trick go bring the rabble
 o'er whom i give thee power here to this place
 incite them to quick motion for i must
 bestow upon the eyes of this young couple
 some vanity of mine art it is my promise
 and they expect it from me
ariel presently
prospero ay with a twink
ariel before you can say come and go'
 and breathe twice and cry so so'
 each one tripping on his toe
 will be here with mop and mow
 do you love me master no
prospero dearly my delicate ariel do not approach
 till thou dost hear me call
ariel well i conceive
 exit
prospero look thou be true do not give dalliance
 too much the rein the strongest oaths are straw
 to the fire i the blood be more abstemious
 or else good night your vow
ferdinand i warrant you sir
 the white cold virgin snow upon my heart
 abates the ardour of my liver
prospero well
 now come my ariel bring a corollary
 rather than want a spirit appear and pertly
 no tongue all eyes be silent
 soft music
 enter iris
iris ceres most bounteous lady thy rich leas
 of wheat rye barley vetches oats and pease
 thy turfy mountains where live nibbling sheep
 and flat meads thatch'd with stover them to keep
 thy banks with pioned and twilled brims
 which spongy april at thy hest betrims
 to make cold nymphs chaste crowns and thy broom groves
 whose shadow the dismissed bachelor loves
 being lasslorn thy poleclipt vineyard
 and thy seamarge sterile and rockyhard
 where thou thyself dost airthe queen o the sky
 whose watery arch and messenger am i
 bids thee leave these and with her sovereign grace
 here on this grassplot in this very place
 to come and sport her peacocks fly amain
 approach rich ceres her to entertain
 enter ceres
ceres hail manycolour'd messenger that ne'er
 dost disobey the wife of jupiter
 who with thy saffron wings upon my flowers
 diffusest honeydrops refreshing showers
 and with each end of thy blue bow dost crown
 my bosky acres and my unshrubb'd down
 rich scarf to my proud earth why hath thy queen
 summon'd me hither to this shortgrass'd green
iris a contract of true love to celebrate
 and some donation freely to estate
 on the blest lovers
ceres tell me heavenly bow
 if venus or her son as thou dost know
 do now attend the queen since they did plot
 the means that dusky dis my daughter got
 her and her blind boy's scandal'd company
 i have forsworn
iris of her society
 be not afraid i met her deity
 cutting the clouds towards paphos and her son
 dovedrawn with her here thought they to have done
 some wanton charm upon this man and maid
 whose vows are that no bedright shall be paid
 till hymen's torch be lighted but vain
