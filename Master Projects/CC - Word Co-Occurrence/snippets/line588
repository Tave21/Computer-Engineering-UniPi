 and here an engine fit for my proceeding
 i'll be so bold to break the seal for once
 reads
 my thoughts do harbour with my silvia nightly
 and slaves they are to me that send them flying
 o could their master come and go as lightly
 himself would lodge where senseless they are lying
 my herald thoughts in thy pure bosom rest them
 while i their king that hither them importune
 do curse the grace that with such grace hath bless'd them
 because myself do want my servants fortune
 i curse myself for they are sent by me
 that they should harbour where their lord would be'
 what's here
 silvia this night i will enfranchise thee'
 tis so and here's the ladder for the purpose
 why phaetonfor thou art merops son
 wilt thou aspire to guide the heavenly car
 and with thy daring folly burn the world
 wilt thou reach stars because they shine on thee
 go base intruder overweening slave
 bestow thy fawning smiles on equal mates
 and think my patience more than thy desert
 is privilege for thy departure hence
 thank me for this more than for all the favours
 which all too much i have bestow'd on thee
 but if thou linger in my territories
 longer than swiftest expedition
 will give thee time to leave our royal court
 by heaven my wrath shall far exceed the love
 i ever bore my daughter or thyself
 be gone i will not hear thy vain excuse
 but as thou lovest thy life make speed from hence
 exit
valentine and why not death rather than living torment
 to die is to be banish'd from myself
 and silvia is myself banish'd from her
 is self from self a deadly banishment
 what light is light if silvia be not seen
 what joy is joy if silvia be not by
 unless it be to think that she is by
 and feed upon the shadow of perfection
 except i be by silvia in the night
 there is no music in the nightingale
 unless i look on silvia in the day
 there is no day for me to look upon
 she is my essence and i leave to be
 if i be not by her fair influence
 foster'd illumined cherish'd kept alive
 i fly not death to fly his deadly doom
 tarry i here i but attend on death
 but fly i hence i fly away from life
 enter proteus and launce
proteus run boy run run and seek him out
launce soho soho
proteus what seest thou
launce him we go to find there's not a hair on's head
 but tis a valentine
proteus valentine
valentine no
proteus who then his spirit
valentine neither
proteus what then
valentine nothing
launce can nothing speak master shall i strike
proteus who wouldst thou strike
launce nothing
proteus villain forbear
launce why sir i'll strike nothing i pray you
proteus sirrah i say forbear friend valentine a word
valentine my ears are stopt and cannot hear good news
 so much of bad already hath possess'd them
proteus then in dumb silence will i bury mine
 for they are harsh untuneable and bad
valentine is silvia dead
proteus no valentine
valentine no valentine indeed for sacred silvia
 hath she forsworn me
proteus no valentine
valentine no valentine if silvia have forsworn me
 what is your news
launce sir there is a proclamation that you are vanished
proteus that thou art banishedo that's the news
 from hence from silvia and from me thy friend
valentine o i have fed upon this woe already
 and now excess of it will make me surfeit
 doth silvia know that i am banished
proteus ay ay and she hath offer'd to the doom
 which unreversed stands in effectual force
 a sea of melting pearl which some call tears
 those at her father's churlish feet she tender'd
 with them upon her knees her humble self
 wringing her hands whose whiteness so became them
 as if but now they waxed pale for woe
 but neither bended knees pure hands held up
 sad sighs deep groans nor silvershedding tears
 could penetrate her uncompassionate sire
 but valentine if he be ta'en must die
 besides her intercession chafed him so
 when she for thy repeal was suppliant
 that to close prison he commanded her
 with many bitter threats of biding there
valentine no more unless the next word that thou speak'st
 have some malignant power upon my life
 if so i pray thee breathe it in mine ear
 as ending anthem of my endless dolour
proteus cease to lament for that thou canst not help
 and study help for that which thou lament'st
 time is the nurse and breeder of all good
 here if thou stay thou canst not see thy love
 besides thy staying will abridge thy life
 hope is a lover's staff walk hence with that
 and manage it against despairing thoughts
 thy letters may be here though thou art hence
 which being writ to me shall be deliver'd
 even in the milkwhite bosom of thy love
 the time now serves not to expostulate
 come i'll convey thee through the citygate
 and ere i part with thee confer at large
 of all that may concern thy loveaffairs
 as thou lovest silvia though not for thyself
 regard thy danger and along with me
valentine i pray thee launce an if thou seest my boy
 bid him make haste and meet me at the northgate
proteus go sirrah find him out come valentine
valentine o my dear silvia hapless valentine
 exeunt valentine and proteus
launce i am but a fool look you and yet i have the wit to
 think my master is a kind of a knave but that's

 team of horse shall not pluck that from me nor who
 tis i love and yet tis a woman but what woman i

 a maid for she is her master's maid and serves for
 wages she hath more qualities than a waterspaniel
 which is much in a bare christian
 pulling out a paper

 imprimis she can fetch and carry why a horse
 can do no more nay a horse cannot fetch but only
 carry therefore is she better than a jade item
