 which does mend nature change it rather but
 the art itself is nature
perdita so it is
polixenes then make your garden rich in gillyvors
 and do not call them bastards
perdita i'll not put
 the dibble in earth to set one slip of them
 no more than were i painted i would wish
 this youth should say twere well and only therefore
 desire to breed by me here's flowers for you
 hot lavender mints savoury marjoram
 the marigold that goes to bed wi the sun
 and with him rises weeping these are flowers
 of middle summer and i think they are given
 to men of middle age you're very welcome
camillo i should leave grazing were i of your flock
 and only live by gazing
perdita out alas
 you'd be so lean that blasts of january
 would blow you through and through
 now my fair'st friend
 i would i had some flowers o the spring that might
 become your time of day and yours and yours
 that wear upon your virgin branches yet
 your maidenheads growing o proserpina
 for the flowers now that frighted thou let'st fall
 from dis's waggon daffodils
 that come before the swallow dares and take
 the winds of march with beauty violets dim
 but sweeter than the lids of juno's eyes
 or cytherea's breath pale primroses
 that die unmarried ere they can behold
 bight phoebus in his strengtha malady
 most incident to maids bold oxlips and
 the crown imperial lilies of all kinds
 the flowerdeluce being one o these i lack
 to make you garlands of and my sweet friend
 to strew him o'er and o'er
florizel what like a corse
perdita no like a bank for love to lie and play on
 not like a corse or if not to be buried
 but quick and in mine arms come take your flowers
 methinks i play as i have seen them do
 in whitsun pastorals sure this robe of mine
 does change my disposition
florizel what you do
 still betters what is done when you speak sweet
 i'ld have you do it ever when you sing
 i'ld have you buy and sell so so give alms
 pray so and for the ordering your affairs
 to sing them too when you do dance i wish you
 a wave o the sea that you might ever do
 nothing but that move still still so
 and own no other function each your doing
 so singular in each particular
 crowns what you are doing in the present deed
 that all your acts are queens
perdita o doricles
 your praises are too large but that your youth
 and the true blood which peepeth fairly through't
 do plainly give you out an unstain'd shepherd
 with wisdom i might fear my doricles
 you woo'd me the false way
florizel i think you have
 as little skill to fear as i have purpose
 to put you to't but come our dance i pray
 your hand my perdita so turtles pair
 that never mean to part
perdita i'll swear for em
polixenes this is the prettiest lowborn lass that ever
 ran on the greensward nothing she does or seems
 but smacks of something greater than herself
 too noble for this place
camillo he tells her something
 that makes her blood look out good sooth she is
 the queen of curds and cream
clown come on strike up
dorcas mopsa must be your mistress marry garlic
 to mend her kissing with
mopsa now in good time
clown not a word a word we stand upon our manners

 music here a dance of shepherds and
 shepherdesses
polixenes pray good shepherd what fair swain is this
 which dances with your daughter
shepherd they call him doricles and boasts himself
 to have a worthy feeding but i have it
 upon his own report and i believe it
 he looks like sooth he says he loves my daughter
 i think so too for never gazed the moon
 upon the water as he'll stand and read
 as twere my daughter's eyes and to be plain
 i think there is not half a kiss to choose
 who loves another best
polixenes she dances featly
shepherd so she does any thing though i report it
 that should be silent if young doricles
 do light upon her she shall bring him that
 which he not dreams of
 enter servant
servant o master if you did but hear the pedlar at the
 door you would never dance again after a tabour and
 pipe no the bagpipe could not move you he sings
 several tunes faster than you'll tell money he
 utters them as he had eaten ballads and all men's
 ears grew to his tunes
clown he could never come better he shall come in i
 love a ballad but even too well if it be doleful
 matter merrily set down or a very pleasant thing
 indeed and sung lamentably
servant he hath songs for man or woman of all sizes no
 milliner can so fit his customers with gloves he
 has the prettiest lovesongs for maids so without
 bawdry which is strange with such delicate
 burthens of dildos and fadings jump her and thump
 her and where some stretchmouthed rascal would
 as it were mean mischief and break a foul gap into
 the matter he makes the maid to answer whoop do me
 no harm good man puts him off slights him with
 whoop do me no harm good man'
polixenes this is a brave fellow
clown believe me thou talkest of an admirable conceited
 fellow has he any unbraided wares
servant he hath ribbons of an the colours i the rainbow
 points more than all the lawyers in bohemia can
 learnedly handle though they come to him by the
 gross inkles caddisses cambrics lawns why he
 sings em over as they were gods or goddesses you
 would think a smock were a sheangel he so chants
 to the sleevehand and the work about the square on't
clown prithee bring him in and let him approach singing
perdita forewarn him that he use no scurrilous words in s tunes
 exit servant
clown you have of these pedlars that have more in them
 than you'ld think sister
perdita ay good brother or go about to think

 cyprus black as e'er was crow
 gloves as sweet as damask roses
 masks for faces and for noses
 bugle bracelet necklace amber

 golden quoifs and stomachers
 for my lads to give their dears
 pins and pokingsticks of steel
 what maids lack from head to heel
 come buy of me come come buy come buy
 buy lads or else your lasses cry come buy
clown if i were not in love with mopsa thou shouldst take
 no money of me but being enthralled as i am it
 will also be the bondage of certain ribbons and gloves
mopsa i was promised them against the feast but they come
 not too late now
dorcas he hath promised you more than that or there be liars
mopsa he hath paid you all he promised you may be he has
 paid you more which will shame you to give him again
clown is there no manners left among maids will they
 wear their plackets where they should bear their
 faces is there not milkingtime when you are
 going to bed or kilnhole to whistle off these
 secrets but you must be tittletattling before all
 our guests tis well they are whispering clamour
 your tongues and not a word more
mopsa i have done come you promised me a tawdrylace
 and a pair of sweet gloves
clown have i not told thee how i was cozened by the way
 and lost all my money
autolycus and indeed sir there are cozeners abroad
 therefore it behoves men to be wary
clown fear not thou man thou shalt lose nothing here
autolycus i hope so sir for i have about me many parcels of charge
clown what hast here ballads
mopsa pray now buy some i love a ballad in print o'
 life for then we are sure they are true
autolycus here's one to a very doleful tune how a usurer's
 wife was brought to bed of twenty moneybags at a
 burthen and how she longed to eat adders heads and
 toads carbonadoed
mopsa is it true think you
autolycus very true and but a month old
dorcas bless me from marrying a usurer
autolycus here's the midwife's name to't one mistress
 taleporter and five or six honest wives that were
 present why should i carry lies abroad
mopsa pray you now buy it
clown come on lay it by and let's first see moe
 ballads we'll buy the other things anon
autolycus here's another ballad of a fish that appeared upon
 the coast on wednesday the fourscore of april
 forty thousand fathom above water and sung this
 ballad against the hard hearts of maids it was
 thought she was a woman and was turned into a cold
 fish for she would not exchange flesh with one that
 loved her the ballad is very pitiful and as true
dorcas is it true too think you
autolycus five justices hands at it and witnesses more than
 my pack will hold
clown lay it by too another
