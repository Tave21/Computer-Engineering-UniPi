 five or at seven
marina earlier too sir if now i be one
lysimachus why the house you dwell in proclaims you to be a
 creature of sale
marina do you know this house to be a place of such resort
 and will come into t i hear say you are of
 honourable parts and are the governor of this place
lysimachus why hath your principal made known unto you who i am
marina who is my principal
lysimachus why your herbwoman she that sets seeds and roots
 of shame and iniquity o you have heard something
 of my power and so stand aloof for more serious
 wooing but i protest to thee pretty one my
 authority shall not see thee or else look friendly
 upon thee come bring me to some private place
 come come
marina if you were born to honour show it now
 if put upon you make the judgment good
 that thought you worthy of it
lysimachus how's this how's this some more be sage
marina for me
 that am a maid though most ungentle fortune
 have placed me in this sty where since i came
 diseases have been sold dearer than physic
 o that the gods
 would set me free from this unhallow'd place
 though they did change me to the meanest bird
 that flies i the purer air
lysimachus i did not think
 thou couldst have spoke so well ne'er dream'd thou couldst
 had i brought hither a corrupted mind
 thy speech had alter'd it hold here's gold for thee
 persever in that clear way thou goest
 and the gods strengthen thee
marina the good gods preserve you
lysimachus for me be you thoughten
 that i came with no ill intent for to me
 the very doors and windows savour vilely
 fare thee well thou art a piece of virtue and
 i doubt not but thy training hath been noble
 hold here's more gold for thee
 a curse upon him die he like a thief
 that robs thee of thy goodness if thou dost
 hear from me it shall be for thy good
 reenter boult
boult i beseech your honour one piece for me
lysimachus avaunt thou damned doorkeeper
 your house but for this virgin that doth prop it
 would sink and overwhelm you away
 exit
boult how's this we must take another course with you
 if your peevish chastity which is not worth a
 breakfast in the cheapest country under the cope
 shall undo a whole household let me be gelded like
 a spaniel come your ways
marina whither would you have me
boult i must have your maidenhead taken off or the common
 hangman shall execute it come your ways we'll
 have no more gentlemen driven away come your ways i say
 reenter bawd
bawd how now what's the matter
boult worse and worse mistress she has here spoken holy
 words to the lord lysimachus
bawd o abominable
boult she makes our profession as it were to stink afore
 the face of the gods
bawd marry hang her up for ever
boult the nobleman would have dealt with her like a
 nobleman and she sent him away as cold as a
 snowball saying his prayers too
bawd boult take her away use her at thy pleasure
 crack the glass of her virginity and make the rest malleable
boult an if she were a thornier piece of ground than she
 is she shall be ploughed
marina hark hark you gods
bawd she conjures away with her would she had never
 come within my doors marry hang you she's born
 to undo us will you not go the way of womenkind
 marry come up my dish of chastity with rosemary and bays
 exit
boult come mistress come your ways with me
marina whither wilt thou have me
boult to take from you the jewel you hold so dear
marina prithee tell me one thing first
boult come now your one thing
marina what canst thou wish thine enemy to be
boult why i could wish him to be my master or rather my mistress
marina neither of these are so bad as thou art
 since they do better thee in their command
 thou hold'st a place for which the pained'st fiend
 of hell would not in reputation change
 thou art the damned doorkeeper to every
 coistrel that comes inquiring for his tib
 to the choleric fisting of every rogue
 thy ear is liable thy food is such
 as hath been belch'd on by infected lungs
boult what would you have me do go to the wars would
 you where a man may serve seven years for the loss
 of a leg and have not money enough in the end to
 buy him a wooden one
marina do any thing but this thou doest empty
 old receptacles or common shores of filth
 serve by indenture to the common hangman
 any of these ways are yet better than this
 for what thou professest a baboon could he speak
 would own a name too dear o that the gods
 would safely deliver me from this place
 here here's gold for thee
 if that thy master would gain by thee
 proclaim that i can sing weave sew and dance
 with other virtues which i'll keep from boast
 and i will undertake all these to teach
 i doubt not but this populous city will
 yield many scholars
boult but can you teach all this you speak of
marina prove that i cannot take me home again
 and prostitute me to the basest groom
 that doth frequent your house
boult well i will see what i can do for thee if i can
 place thee i will
marina but amongst honest women
boult faith my acquaintance lies little amongst them
 but since my master and mistress have bought you
 there's no going but by their consent therefore i
 will make them acquainted with your purpose and i
 doubt not but i shall find them tractable enough
 come i'll do for thee what i can come your ways

gower marina thus the brothel scapes and chances
 into an honest house our story says
 she sings like one immortal and she dances
 as goddesslike to her admired lays
 deep clerks she dumbs and with her needle composes
 nature's own shape of bud bird branch or berry
 that even her art sisters the natural roses
 her inkle silk twin with the rubied cherry
 that pupils lacks she none of noble race
 who pour their bounty on her and her gain
 she gives the cursed bawd here we her place
 and to her father turn our thoughts again
 where we left him on the sea we there him lost
 whence driven before the winds he is arrived
 here where his daughter dwells and on this coast
 suppose him now at anchor the city strived
 god neptune's annual feast to keep from whence

 his banners sable trimm'd with rich expense
 and to him in his barge with fervor hies
