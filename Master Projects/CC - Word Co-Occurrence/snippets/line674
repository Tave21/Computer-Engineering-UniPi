act iv
scene iv london the palace
 enter king henry vi with a supplication and the
 queen with suffolk's head buckingham and lord say
queen margaret oft have i heard that grief softens the mind
 and makes it fearful and degenerate
 think therefore on revenge and cease to weep
 but who can cease to weep and look on this
 here may his head lie on my throbbing breast
 but where's the body that i should embrace
buckingham what answer makes your grace to the rebels'
 supplication
king henry vi i'll send some holy bishop to entreat
 for god forbid so many simple souls
 should perish by the sword and i myself
 rather than bloody war shall cut them short
 will parley with jack cade their general
 but stay i'll read it over once again
queen margaret ah barbarous villains hath this lovely face
 ruled like a wandering planet over me
 and could it not enforce them to relent
 that were unworthy to behold the same
king henry vi lord say jack cade hath sworn to have thy head
say ay but i hope your highness shall have his
king henry vi how now madam
 still lamenting and mourning for suffolk's death
 i fear me love if that i had been dead
 thou wouldst not have mourn'd so much for me
queen margaret no my love i should not mourn but die for thee
 enter a messenger
king henry vi how now what news why comest thou in such haste
messenger the rebels are in southwark fly my lord
 jack cade proclaims himself lord mortimer
 descended from the duke of clarence house
 and calls your grace usurper openly
 and vows to crown himself in westminster
 his army is a ragged multitude
 of hinds and peasants rude and merciless
 sir humphrey stafford and his brother's death
 hath given them heart and courage to proceed
 all scholars lawyers courtiers gentlemen
 they call false caterpillars and intend their death
