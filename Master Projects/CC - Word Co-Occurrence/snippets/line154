and when he had opened the third seal i heard the third beast say come and see and i beheld and lo a black horse and he that sat on him had a pair of balances in his hand
and i heard a voice in the midst of the four beasts say a measure of wheat for a penny and three measures of barley for a penny and see thou hurt not the oil and the wine
and when he had opened the fourth seal i heard the voice of the fourth beast say come and see
and i looked and behold a pale horse and his name that sat on him was death and hell followed with him and power was given unto them over the fourth part of the earth to kill with sword and with hunger and with death and with the beasts of the earth
and when he had opened the fifth seal i saw under the altar the souls of them that were slain for the word of god and for the testimony which they held
and they cried with a loud voice saying how long o lord holy and true dost thou not judge and avenge our blood on them that dwell on the earth
and white robes were given unto every one of them and it was said unto them that they should rest yet for a little season until their fellowservants also and their brethren that should be killed as they were should be fulfilled
and i beheld when he had opened the sixth seal and lo there was a great earthquake and the sun became black as sackcloth of hair and the moon became as blood
and the stars of heaven fell unto the earth even as a fig tree casteth her untimely figs when she is shaken of a mighty wind
and the heaven departed as a scroll when it is rolled together and every mountain and island were moved out of their places
and the kings of the earth and the great men and the rich men and the chief captains and the mighty men and every bondman and every free man hid themselves in the dens and in the rocks of the mountains
and said to the mountains and rocks fall on us and hide us from the face of him that sitteth on the throne and from the wrath of the lamb
for the great day of his wrath is come and who shall be able to stand
and after these things i saw four angels standing on the four corners of the earth holding the four winds of the earth that the wind should not blow on the earth nor on the sea nor on any tree
and i saw another angel ascending from the east having the seal of the living god and he cried with a loud voice to the four angels to whom it was given to hurt the earth and the sea
saying hurt not the earth neither the sea nor the trees till we have sealed the servants of our god in their foreheads
and i heard the number of them which were sealed and there were sealed an hundred and forty and four thousand of all the tribes of the children of israel
of the tribe of juda were sealed twelve thousand of the tribe of reuben were sealed twelve thousand of the tribe of gad were sealed twelve thousand
of the tribe of aser were sealed twelve thousand of the tribe of nephthalim were sealed twelve thousand of the tribe of manasses were sealed twelve thousand
of the tribe of simeon were sealed twelve thousand of the tribe of levi were sealed twelve thousand of the tribe of issachar were sealed twelve thousand
of the tribe of zabulon were sealed twelve thousand of the tribe of joseph were sealed twelve thousand of the tribe of benjamin were sealed twelve thousand
after this i beheld and lo a great multitude which no man could number of all nations and kindreds and people and tongues stood before the throne and before the lamb clothed with white robes and palms in their hands
and cried with a loud voice saying salvation to our god which sitteth upon the throne and unto the lamb
and all the angels stood round about the throne and about the elders and the four beasts and fell before the throne on their faces and worshipped god
saying amen blessing and glory and wisdom and thanksgiving and honour and power and might be unto our god for ever and ever amen
and one of the elders answered saying unto me what are these which are arrayed in white robes and whence came they
and i said unto him sir thou knowest and he said to me these are they which came out of great tribulation and have washed their robes and made them white in the blood of the lamb
therefore are they before the throne of god and serve him day and night in his temple and he that sitteth on the throne shall dwell among them
they shall hunger no more neither thirst any more neither shall the sun light on them nor any heat
for the lamb which is in the midst of the throne shall feed them and shall lead them unto living fountains of waters and god shall wipe away all tears from their eyes
and when he had opened the seventh seal there was silence in heaven about the space of half an hour
and i saw the seven angels which stood before god and to them were given seven trumpets
and another angel came and stood at the altar having a golden censer and there was given unto him much incense that he should offer it with the prayers of all saints upon the golden altar which was before the throne
and the smoke of the incense which came with the prayers of the saints ascended up before god out of the angel's hand
and the angel took the censer and filled it with fire of the altar and cast it into the earth and there were voices and thunderings and lightnings and an earthquake
and the seven angels which had the seven trumpets prepared themselves to sound
the first angel sounded and there followed hail and fire mingled with blood and they were cast upon the earth and the third part of trees was burnt up and all green grass was burnt up
and the second angel sounded and as it were a great mountain burning with fire was cast into the sea and the third part of the sea became blood
and the third part of the creatures which were in the sea and had life died and the third part of the ships were destroyed
and the third angel sounded and there fell a great star from heaven burning as it were a lamp and it fell upon the third part of the rivers and upon the fountains of waters
and the name of the star is called wormwood and the third part of the waters became wormwood and many men died of the waters because they were made bitter
and the fourth angel sounded and the third part of the sun was smitten and the third part of the moon and the third part of the stars so as the third part of them was darkened and the day shone not for a third part of it and the night likewise
and i beheld and heard an angel flying through the midst of heaven saying with a loud voice woe woe woe to the inhabiters of the earth by reason of the other voices of the trumpet of the three angels which are yet to sound
and the fifth angel sounded and i saw a star fall from heaven unto the earth and to him was given the key of the bottomless pit
and he opened the bottomless pit and there arose a smoke out of the pit as the smoke of a great furnace and the sun and the air were darkened by reason of the smoke of the pit
and there came out of the smoke locusts upon the earth and unto them was given power as the scorpions of the earth have power
and it was commanded them that they should not hurt the grass of the earth neither any green thing neither any tree but only those men which have not the seal of god in their foreheads
and to them it was given that they should not kill them but that they should be tormented five months and their torment was as the torment of a scorpion when he striketh a man
and in those days shall men seek death and shall not find it and shall desire to die and death shall flee from them
and the shapes of the locusts were like unto horses prepared unto battle and on their heads were as it were crowns like gold and their faces were as the faces of men
and they had hair as the hair of women and their teeth were as the teeth of lions
and they had breastplates as it were breastplates of iron and the sound of their wings was as the sound of chariots of many horses running to battle
and they had tails like unto scorpions and there were stings in their tails and their power was to hurt men five months
and they had a king over them which is the angel of the bottomless pit whose name in the hebrew tongue is abaddon but in the greek tongue hath his name apollyon
one woe is past and behold there come two woes more hereafter
and the sixth angel sounded and i heard a voice from the four horns of the golden altar which is before god
saying to the sixth angel which had the trumpet loose the four angels which are bound in the great river euphrates
and the four angels were loosed which were prepared for an hour and a day and a month and a year for to slay the third part of men
and the number of the army of the horsemen were two hundred thousand thousand and i heard the number of them
and thus i saw the horses in the vision and them that sat on them having breastplates of fire and of jacinth and brimstone and the heads of the horses were as the heads of lions and out of their mouths issued fire and smoke and brimstone
by these three was the third part of men killed by the fire and by the smoke and by the brimstone which issued out of their mouths
for their power is in their mouth and in their tails for their tails were like unto serpents and had heads and with them they do hurt
and the rest of the men which were not killed by these plagues yet repented not of the works of their hands that they should not worship devils and idols of gold and silver and brass and stone and of wood which neither can see nor hear nor walk
neither repented they of their murders nor of their sorceries nor of their fornication nor of their thefts
and i saw another mighty angel come down from heaven clothed with a cloud and a rainbow was upon his head and his face was as it were the sun and his feet as pillars of fire
and he had in his hand a little book open and he set his right foot upon the sea and his left foot on the earth
and cried with a loud voice as when a lion roareth and when he had cried seven thunders uttered their voices
and when the seven thunders had uttered their voices i was about to write and i heard a voice from heaven saying unto me seal up those things which the seven thunders uttered and write them not
and the angel which i saw stand upon the sea and upon the earth lifted up his hand to heaven
and sware by him that liveth for ever and ever who created heaven and the things that therein are and the earth and the things that therein are and the sea and the things which are therein that there should be time no longer
but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound the mystery of god should be finished as he hath declared to his servants the prophets
and the voice which i heard from heaven spake unto me again and said go and take the little book which is open in the hand of the angel which standeth upon the sea and upon the earth
and i went unto the angel and said unto him give me the little book and he said unto me take it and eat it up and it shall make thy belly bitter but it shall be in thy mouth sweet as honey
and i took the little book out of the angel's hand and ate it up and it was in my mouth sweet as honey and as soon as i had eaten it my belly was bitter
and he said unto me thou must prophesy again before many peoples and nations and tongues and kings
and there was given me a reed like unto a rod and the angel stood saying rise and measure the temple of god and the altar and them that worship therein
but the court which is without the temple leave out and measure it not for it is given unto the gentiles and the holy city shall they tread under foot forty and two months
and i will give power unto my two witnesses and they shall prophesy a thousand two hundred and threescore days clothed in sackcloth
these are the two olive trees and the two candlesticks standing before the god of the earth
and if any man will hurt them fire proceedeth out of their mouth and devoureth their enemies and if any man will hurt them he must in this manner be killed
these have power to shut heaven that it rain not in the days of their prophecy and have power over waters to turn them to blood and to smite the earth with all plagues as often as they will
and when they shall have finished their testimony the beast that ascendeth out of the bottomless pit shall make war against them and shall overcome them and kill them
and their dead bodies shall lie in the street of the great city which spiritually is called sodom and egypt where also our lord was crucified
and they of the people and kindreds and tongues and nations shall see their dead bodies three days and an half and shall not suffer their dead bodies to be put in graves
and they that dwell upon the earth shall rejoice over them and make merry and shall send gifts one to another because these two prophets tormented them that dwelt on the earth
and after three days and an half the spirit of life from god entered into them and they stood upon their feet and great fear fell upon them which saw them
and they heard a great voice from heaven saying unto them come up hither and they ascended up to heaven in a cloud and their enemies beheld them
and the same hour was there a great earthquake and the tenth part of the city fell and in the earthquake were slain of men seven thousand and the remnant were affrighted and gave glory to the god of heaven
the second woe is past and behold the third woe cometh quickly
and the seventh angel sounded and there were great voices in heaven saying the kingdoms of this world are become the kingdoms of our lord and of his christ and he shall reign for ever and ever
and the four and twenty elders which sat before god on their seats fell upon their faces and worshipped god
saying we give thee thanks o lord god almighty which art and wast and art to come because thou hast taken to thee thy great power and hast reigned
and the nations were angry and thy wrath is come and the time of the dead that they should be judged and that thou shouldest give reward unto thy servants the prophets and to the saints and them that fear thy name small and great and shouldest destroy them which destroy the earth
and the temple of god was opened in heaven and there was seen in his temple the ark of his testament and there were lightnings and voices and thunderings and an earthquake and great hail
and there appeared a great wonder in heaven a woman clothed with the sun and the moon under her feet and upon her head a crown of twelve stars
and she being with child cried travailing in birth and pained to be delivered
and there appeared another wonder in heaven and behold a great red dragon having seven heads and ten horns and seven crowns upon his heads
and his tail drew the third part of the stars of heaven and did cast them to the earth and the dragon stood before the woman which was ready to be delivered for to devour her child as soon as it was born
and she brought forth a man child who was to rule all nations with a rod of iron and her child was caught up unto god and to his throne
and the woman fled into the wilderness where she hath a place prepared of god that they should feed her there a thousand two hundred and threescore days
and there was war in heaven michael and his angels fought against the dragon and the dragon fought and his angels
and prevailed not neither was their place found any more in heaven
and the great dragon was cast out that old serpent called the devil and satan which deceiveth the whole world he was cast out into the earth and his angels were cast out with him
and i heard a loud voice saying in heaven now is come salvation and strength and the kingdom of our god and the power of his christ for the accuser of our brethren is cast down which accused them before our god day and night
and they overcame him by the blood of the lamb and by the word of their testimony and they loved not their lives unto the death
therefore rejoice ye heavens and ye that dwell in them woe to the inhabiters of the earth and of the sea for the devil is come down unto you having great wrath because he knoweth that he hath but a short time
and when the dragon saw that he was cast unto the earth he persecuted the woman which brought forth the man child
and to the woman were given two wings of a great eagle that she might fly into the wilderness into her place where she is nourished for a time and times and half a time from the face of the serpent
and the serpent cast out of his mouth water as a flood after the woman that he might cause her to be carried away of the flood
and the earth helped the woman and the earth opened her mouth and swallowed up the flood which the dragon cast out of his mouth
and the dragon was wroth with the woman and went to make war with the remnant of her seed which keep the commandments of god and have the testimony of jesus christ
and i stood upon the sand of the sea and saw a beast rise up out of the sea having seven heads and ten horns and upon his horns ten crowns and upon his heads the name of blasphemy
and the beast which i saw was like unto a leopard and his feet were as the feet of a bear and his mouth as the mouth of a lion and the dragon gave him his power and his seat and great authority
and i saw one of his heads as it were wounded to death and his deadly wound was healed and all the world wondered after the beast
and they worshipped the dragon which gave power unto the beast and they worshipped the beast saying who is like unto the beast who is able to make war with him
and there was given unto him a mouth speaking great things and blasphemies and power was given unto him to continue forty and two months
and he opened his mouth in blasphemy against god to blaspheme his name and his tabernacle and them that dwell in heaven
and it was given unto him to make war with the saints and to overcome them and power was given him over all kindreds and tongues and nations
and all that dwell upon the earth shall worship him whose names are not written in the book of life of the lamb slain from the foundation of the world
if any man have an ear let him hear
he that leadeth into captivity shall go into captivity he that killeth with the sword must be killed with the sword here is the patience and the faith of the saints
and i beheld another beast coming up out of the earth and he had two horns like a lamb and he spake as a dragon
and he exerciseth all the power of the first beast before him and causeth the earth and them which dwell therein to worship the first beast whose deadly wound was healed
and he doeth great wonders so that he maketh fire come down from heaven on the earth in the sight of men
and deceiveth them that dwell on the earth by the means of those miracles which he had power to do in the sight of the beast saying to them that dwell on the earth that they should make an image to the beast which had the wound by a sword and did live
and he had power to give life unto the image of the beast that the image of the beast should both speak and cause that as many as would not worship the image of the beast should be killed
and he causeth all both small and great rich and poor free and bond to receive a mark in their right hand or in their foreheads
and that no man might buy or sell save he that had the mark or the name of the beast or the number of his name
here is wisdom let him that hath understanding count the number of the beast for it is the number of a man and his number is six hundred threescore and six
and i looked and lo a lamb stood on the mount sion and with him an hundred forty and four thousand having his father's name written in their foreheads
and i heard a voice from heaven as the voice of many waters and as the voice of a great thunder and i heard the voice of harpers harping with their harps
and they sung as it were a new song before the throne and before the four beasts and the elders and no man could learn that song but the hundred and forty and four thousand which were redeemed from the earth
these are they which were not defiled with women for they are virgins these are they which follow the lamb whithersoever he goeth these were redeemed from among men being the firstfruits unto god and to the lamb
and in their mouth was found no guile for they are without fault before the throne of god
and i saw another angel fly in the midst of heaven having the everlasting gospel to preach unto them that dwell on the earth and to every nation and kindred and tongue and people
saying with a loud voice fear god and give glory to him for the hour of his judgment is come and worship him that made heaven and earth and the sea and the fountains of waters
and there followed another angel saying babylon is fallen is fallen that great city because she made all nations drink of the wine of the wrath of her fornication
and the third angel followed them saying with a loud voice if any man worship the beast and his image and receive his mark in his forehead or in his hand
the same shall drink of the wine of the wrath of god which is poured out without mixture into the cup of his indignation and he shall be tormented with fire and brimstone in the presence of the holy angels and in the presence of the lamb
and the smoke of their torment ascendeth up for ever and ever and they have no rest day nor night who worship the beast and his image and whosoever receiveth the mark of his name
here is the patience of the saints here are they that keep the commandments of god and the faith of jesus
and i heard a voice from heaven saying unto me write blessed are the dead which die in the lord from henceforth yea saith the spirit that they may rest from their labours and their works do follow them
and i looked and behold a white cloud and upon the cloud one sat like unto the son of man having on his head a golden crown and in his hand a sharp sickle
and another angel came out of the temple crying with a loud voice to him that sat on the cloud thrust in thy sickle and reap for the time is come for thee to reap for the harvest of the earth is ripe
and he that sat on the cloud thrust in his sickle on the earth and the earth was reaped
and another angel came out of the temple which is in heaven he also having a sharp sickle
and another angel came out from the altar which had power over fire and cried with a loud cry to him that had the sharp sickle saying thrust in thy sharp sickle and gather the clusters of the vine of the earth for her grapes are fully ripe
and the angel thrust in his sickle into the earth and gathered the vine of the earth and cast it into the great winepress of the wrath of god
and the winepress was trodden without the city and blood came out of the winepress even unto the horse bridles by the space of a thousand and six hundred furlongs
and i saw another sign in heaven great and marvellous seven angels having the seven last plagues for in them is filled up the wrath of god
and i saw as it were a sea of glass mingled with fire and them that had gotten the victory over the beast and over his image and over his mark and over the number of his name stand on the sea of glass having the harps of god
and they sing the song of moses the servant of god and the song of the lamb saying great and marvellous are thy works lord god almighty just and true are thy ways thou king of saints
who shall not fear thee o lord and glorify thy name for thou only art holy for all nations shall come and worship before thee for thy judgments are made manifest
and after that i looked and behold the temple of the tabernacle of the testimony in heaven was opened
and the seven angels came out of the temple having the seven plagues clothed in pure and white linen and having their breasts girded with golden girdles
and one of the four beasts gave unto the seven angels seven golden vials full of the wrath of god who liveth for ever and ever
and the temple was filled with smoke from the glory of god and from his power and no man was able to enter into the temple till the seven plagues of the seven angels were fulfilled
and i heard a great voice out of the temple saying to the seven angels go your ways and pour out the vials of the wrath of god upon the earth
and the first went and poured out his vial upon the earth and there fell a noisome and grievous sore upon the men which had the mark of the beast and upon them which worshipped his image
and the second angel poured out his vial upon the sea and it became as the blood of a dead man and every living soul died in the sea
and the third angel poured out his vial upon the rivers and fountains of waters and they became blood
and i heard the angel of the waters say thou art righteous o lord which art and wast and shalt be because thou hast judged thus
for they have shed the blood of saints and prophets and thou hast given them blood to drink for they are worthy
and i heard another out of the altar say even so lord god almighty true and righteous are thy judgments
and the fourth angel poured out his vial upon the sun and power was given unto him to scorch men with fire
and men were scorched with great heat and blasphemed the name of god which hath power over these plagues and they repented not to give him glory
and the fifth angel poured out his vial upon the seat of the beast and his kingdom was full of darkness and they gnawed their tongues for pain
and blasphemed the god of heaven because of their pains and their sores and repented not of their deeds
and the sixth angel poured out his vial upon the great river euphrates and the water thereof was dried up that the way of the kings of the east might be prepared
and i saw three unclean spirits like frogs come out of the mouth of the dragon and out of the mouth of the beast and out of the mouth of the false prophet
for they are the spirits of devils working miracles which go forth unto the kings of the earth and of the whole world to gather them to the battle of that great day of god almighty
behold i come as a thief blessed is he that watcheth and keepeth his garments lest he walk naked and they see his shame
and he gathered them together into a place called in the hebrew tongue armageddon
and the seventh angel poured out his vial into the air and there came a great voice out of the temple of heaven from the throne saying it is done
and there were voices and thunders and lightnings and there was a great earthquake such as was not since men were upon the earth so mighty an earthquake and so great
and the great city was divided into three parts and the cities of the nations fell and great babylon came in remembrance before god to give unto her the cup of the wine of the fierceness of his wrath
and every island fled away and the mountains were not found
and there fell upon men a great hail out of heaven every stone about the weight of a talent and men blasphemed god because of the plague of the hail for the plague thereof was exceeding great
and there came one of the seven angels which had the seven vials and talked with me saying unto me come hither i will shew unto thee the judgment of the great whore that sitteth upon many waters
with whom the kings of the earth have committed fornication and the inhabitants of the earth have been made drunk with the wine of her fornication
so he carried me away in the spirit into the wilderness and i saw a woman sit upon a scarlet coloured beast full of names of blasphemy having seven heads and ten horns
and the woman was arrayed in purple and scarlet colour and decked with gold and precious stones and pearls having a golden cup in her hand full of abominations and filthiness of her fornication
and upon her forehead was a name written mystery babylon the great the mother of harlots and abominations of the earth
and i saw the woman drunken with the blood of the saints and with the blood of the martyrs of jesus and when i saw her i wondered with great admiration
and the angel said unto me wherefore didst thou marvel i will tell thee the mystery of the woman and of the beast that carrieth her which hath the seven heads and ten horns
the beast that thou sawest was and is not and shall ascend out of the bottomless pit and go into perdition and they that dwell on the earth shall wonder whose names were not written in the book of life from the foundation of the world when they behold the beast that was and is not and yet is
and here is the mind which hath wisdom the seven heads are seven mountains on which the woman sitteth
and there are seven kings five are fallen and one is and the other is not yet come and when he cometh he must continue a short space
and the beast that was and is not even he is the eighth and is of the seven and goeth into perdition
and the ten horns which thou sawest are ten kings which have received no kingdom as yet but receive power as kings one hour with the beast
these have one mind and shall give their power and strength unto the beast
these shall make war with the lamb and the lamb shall overcome them for he is lord of lords and king of kings and they that are with him are called and chosen and faithful
and he saith unto me the waters which thou sawest where the whore sitteth are peoples and multitudes and nations and tongues
and the ten horns which thou sawest upon the beast these shall hate the whore and shall make her desolate and naked and shall eat her flesh and burn her with fire
for god hath put in their hearts to fulfil his will and to agree and give their kingdom unto the beast until the words of god shall be fulfilled
and the woman which thou sawest is that great city which reigneth over the kings of the earth
and after these things i saw another angel come down from heaven having great power and the earth was lightened with his glory
and he cried mightily with a strong voice saying babylon the great is fallen is fallen and is become the habitation of devils and the hold of every foul spirit and a cage of every unclean and hateful bird
for all nations have drunk of the wine of the wrath of her fornication and the kings of the earth have committed fornication with her and the merchants of the earth are waxed rich through the abundance of her delicacies
and i heard another voice from heaven saying come out of her my people that ye be not partakers of her sins and that ye receive not of her plagues
