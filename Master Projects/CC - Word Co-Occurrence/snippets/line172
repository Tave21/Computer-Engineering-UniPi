 of what hath come to pass for when she saw
 which never shall be foundyou did suspect
 she had disposed with caesar and that your rage
 would not be purged she sent you word she was dead
 but fearing since how it might work hath sent
 me to proclaim the truth and i am come

act iv
scene xv the same a monument
 enter cleopatra and her maids aloft with
 charmian and iras
cleopatra o charmian i will never go from hence
charmian be comforted dear madam
cleopatra no i will not
 all strange and terrible events are welcome
 but comforts we despise our size of sorrow
 proportion'd to our cause must be as great
 as that which makes it
 enter below diomedes
 how now is he dead
diomedes his death's upon him but not dead
 look out o the other side your monument
 his guard have brought him thither
 enter below mark antony borne by the guard
cleopatra o sun
 burn the great sphere thou movest in
 darkling stand
 the varying shore o the world o antony
 antony antony help charmian help iras help
 help friends below let's draw him hither
mark antony peace
 not caesar's valour hath o'erthrown antony
 but antony's hath triumph'd on itself
cleopatra so it should be that none but antony
 should conquer antony but woe tis so
mark antony i am dying egypt dying only
 i here importune death awhile until
 of many thousand kisses the poor last
 i lay up thy lips
cleopatra i dare not dear
 dear my lord pardoni dare not
 lest i be taken not the imperious show
 of the fullfortuned caesar ever shall
 be brooch'd with me if knife drugs
 serpents have
 edge sting or operation i am safe
 your wife octavia with her modest eyes
 and still conclusion shall acquire no honour
 demuring upon me but come come antony
 help me my womenwe must draw thee up
 assist good friends
mark antony o quick or i am gone
cleopatra here's sport indeed how heavy weighs my lord
 our strength is all gone into heaviness
 that makes the weight had i great juno's power
 the strongwing'd mercury should fetch thee up
 and set thee by jove's side yet come a little
 wishes were ever foolso come come come
 they heave mark antony aloft to cleopatra
 and welcome welcome die where thou hast lived
 quicken with kissing had my lips that power
 thus would i wear them out
all a heavy sight
mark antony i am dying egypt dying
 give me some wine and let me speak a little
cleopatra no let me speak and let me rail so high
 that the false housewife fortune break her wheel
 provoked by my offence
mark antony one word sweet queen
 of caesar seek your honour with your safety o
cleopatra they do not go together
mark antony gentle hear me
 none about caesar trust but proculeius
cleopatra my resolution and my hands i'll trust
 none about caesar
mark antony the miserable change now at my end
 lament nor sorrow at but please your thoughts
 in feeding them with those my former fortunes
 wherein i lived the greatest prince o the world
 the noblest and do now not basely die
 not cowardly put off my helmet to
 my countrymana roman by a roman
 valiantly vanquish'd now my spirit is going
 i can no more
cleopatra noblest of men woo't die
 hast thou no care of me shall i abide
 in this dull world which in thy absence is
 no better than a sty o see my women
 mark antony dies
 the crown o the earth doth melt my lord
 o wither'd is the garland of the war
 the soldier's pole is fall'n young boys and girls
 are level now with men the odds is gone
 and there is nothing left remarkable
 beneath the visiting moon
 faints
charmian o quietness lady
iras she is dead too our sovereign
charmian lady
iras madam
charmian o madam madam madam
iras royal egypt empress
charmian peace peace iras
cleopatra no more but e'en a woman and commanded
 by such poor passion as the maid that milks
 and does the meanest chares it were for me
 to throw my sceptre at the injurious gods
 to tell them that this world did equal theirs
 till they had stol'n our jewel all's but naught
 patience is scottish and impatience does
 become a dog that's mad then is it sin
 to rush into the secret house of death
 ere death dare come to us how do you women
 what what good cheer why how now charmian
 my noble girls ah women women look
 our lamp is spent it's out good sirs take heart
 we'll bury him and then what's brave
 what's noble
 let's do it after the high roman fashion
 and make death proud to take us come away
 this case of that huge spirit now is cold
 ah women women come we have no friend
 but resolution and the briefest end
 exeunt those above bearing off mark antony's body
 antony and cleopatra
