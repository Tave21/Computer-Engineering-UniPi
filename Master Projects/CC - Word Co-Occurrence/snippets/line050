2ki1715 and they rejected his statutes and his covenant that he made with their fathers and his testimonies which he testified against them and they followed vanity and became vain and went after the heathen that were round about them concerning whom the lord had charged them that they should not do like them
2ki1716 and they left all the commandments of the lord their god and made them molten images even two calves and made a grove and worshipped all the host of heaven and served baal
2ki1717 and they caused their sons and their daughters to pass through the fire and used divination and enchantments and sold themselves to do evil in the sight of the lord to provoke him to anger
2ki1718 therefore the lord was very angry with israel and removed them out of his sight there was none left but the tribe of judah only
2ki1719 also judah kept not the commandments of the lord their god but walked in the statutes of israel which they made
2ki1720 and the lord rejected all the seed of israel and afflicted them and delivered them into the hand of spoilers until he had cast them out of his sight
2ki1721 for he rent israel from the house of david and they made jeroboam the son of nebat king and jeroboam drave israel from following the lord and made them sin a great sin
2ki1722 for the children of israel walked in all the sins of jeroboam which he did they departed not from them
2ki1723 until the lord removed israel out of his sight as he had said by all his servants the prophets so was israel carried away out of their own land to assyria unto this day
2ki1724 and the king of assyria brought men from babylon and from cuthah and from ava and from hamath and from sepharvaim and placed them in the cities of samaria instead of the children of israel and they possessed samaria and dwelt in the cities thereof
2ki1725 and so it was at the beginning of their dwelling there that they feared not the lord therefore the lord sent lions among them which slew some of them
2ki1726 wherefore they spake to the king of assyria saying the nations which thou hast removed and placed in the cities of samaria know not the manner of the god of the land therefore he hath sent lions among them and behold they slay them because they know not the manner of the god of the land
2ki1727 then the king of assyria commanded saying carry thither one of the priests whom ye brought from thence and let them go and dwell there and let him teach them the manner of the god of the land
2ki1728 then one of the priests whom they had carried away from samaria came and dwelt in bethel and taught them how they should fear the lord
2ki1729 howbeit every nation made gods of their own and put them in the houses of the high places which the samaritans had made every nation in their cities wherein they dwelt
2ki1730 and the men of babylon made succothbenoth and the men of cuth made nergal and the men of hamath made ashima
2ki1731 and the avites made nibhaz and tartak and the sepharvites burnt their children in fire to adrammelech and anammelech the gods of sepharvaim
2ki1732 so they feared the lord and made unto themselves of the lowest of them priests of the high places which sacrificed for them in the houses of the high places
2ki1733 they feared the lord and served their own gods after the manner of the nations whom they carried away from thence
2ki1734 unto this day they do after the former manners they fear not the lord neither do they after their statutes or after their ordinances or after the law and commandment which the lord commanded the children of jacob whom he named israel
2ki1735 with whom the lord had made a covenant and charged them saying ye shall not fear other gods nor bow yourselves to them nor serve them nor sacrifice to them
2ki1736 but the lord who brought you up out of the land of egypt with great power and a stretched out arm him shall ye fear and him shall ye worship and to him shall ye do sacrifice
2ki1737 and the statutes and the ordinances and the law and the commandment which he wrote for you ye shall observe to do for evermore and ye shall not fear other gods
2ki1738 and the covenant that i have made with you ye shall not forget neither shall ye fear other gods
2ki1739 but the lord your god ye shall fear and he shall deliver you out of the hand of all your enemies
2ki1740 howbeit they did not hearken but they did after their former manner
2ki1741 so these nations feared the lord and served their graven images both their children and their children's children as did their fathers so do they unto this day
2ki181 now it came to pass in the third year of hoshea son of elah king of israel that hezekiah the son of ahaz king of judah began to reign
2ki182 twenty and five years old was he when he began to reign and he reigned twenty and nine years in jerusalem his mother's name also was abi the daughter of zachariah
2ki183 and he did that which was right in the sight of the lord according to all that david his father did
2ki184 he removed the high places and brake the images and cut down the groves and brake in pieces the brasen serpent that moses had made for unto those days the children of israel did burn incense to it and he called it nehushtan
2ki185 he trusted in the lord god of israel so that after him was none like him among all the kings of judah nor any that were before him
2ki186 for he clave to the lord and departed not from following him but kept his commandments which the lord commanded moses
2ki187 and the lord was with him and he prospered whithersoever he went forth and he rebelled against the king of assyria and served him not
2ki188 he smote the philistines even unto gaza and the borders thereof from the tower of the watchmen to the fenced city
2ki189 and it came to pass in the fourth year of king hezekiah which was the seventh year of hoshea son of elah king of israel that shalmaneser king of assyria came up against samaria and besieged it
2ki1810 and at the end of three years they took it even in the sixth year of hezekiah that is the ninth year of hoshea king of israel samaria was taken
2ki1811 and the king of assyria did carry away israel unto assyria and put them in halah and in habor by the river of gozan and in the cities of the medes
2ki1812 because they obeyed not the voice of the lord their god but transgressed his covenant and all that moses the servant of the lord commanded and would not hear them nor do them
2ki1813 now in the fourteenth year of king hezekiah did sennacherib king of assyria come up against all the fenced cities of judah and took them
2ki1814 and hezekiah king of judah sent to the king of assyria to lachish saying i have offended return from me that which thou puttest on me will i bear and the king of assyria appointed unto hezekiah king of judah three hundred talents of silver and thirty talents of gold
2ki1815 and hezekiah gave him all the silver that was found in the house of the lord and in the treasures of the king's house
2ki1816 at that time did hezekiah cut off the gold from the doors of the temple of the lord and from the pillars which hezekiah king of judah had overlaid and gave it to the king of assyria
2ki1817 and the king of assyria sent tartan and rabsaris and rabshakeh from lachish to king hezekiah with a great host against jerusalem and they went up and came to jerusalem and when they were come up they came and stood by the conduit of the upper pool which is in the highway of the fuller's field
2ki1818 and when they had called to the king there came out to them eliakim the son of hilkiah which was over the household and shebna the scribe and joah the son of asaph the recorder
2ki1819 and rabshakeh said unto them speak ye now to hezekiah thus saith the great king the king of assyria what confidence is this wherein thou trustest
2ki1820 thou sayest but they are but vain words i have counsel and strength for the war now on whom dost thou trust that thou rebellest against me
2ki1821 now behold thou trustest upon the staff of this bruised reed even upon egypt on which if a man lean it will go into his hand and pierce it so is pharaoh king of egypt unto all that trust on him
2ki1822 but if ye say unto me we trust in the lord our god is not that he whose high places and whose altars hezekiah hath taken away and hath said to judah and jerusalem ye shall worship before this altar in jerusalem
2ki1823 now therefore i pray thee give pledges to my lord the king of assyria and i will deliver thee two thousand horses if thou be able on thy part to set riders upon them
2ki1824 how then wilt thou turn away the face of one captain of the least of my master's servants and put thy trust on egypt for chariots and for horsemen
2ki1825 am i now come up without the lord against this place to destroy it the lord said to me go up against this land and destroy it
2ki1826 then said eliakim the son of hilkiah and shebna and joah unto rabshakeh speak i pray thee to thy servants in the syrian language for we understand it and talk not with us in the jews language in the ears of the people that are on the wall
2ki1827 but rabshakeh said unto them hath my master sent me to thy master and to thee to speak these words hath he not sent me to the men which sit on the wall that they may eat their own dung and drink their own piss with you
2ki1828 then rabshakeh stood and cried with a loud voice in the jews language and spake saying hear the word of the great king the king of assyria
2ki1829 thus saith the king let not hezekiah deceive you for he shall not be able to deliver you out of his hand
2ki1830 neither let hezekiah make you trust in the lord saying the lord will surely deliver us and this city shall not be delivered into the hand of the king of assyria
2ki1831 hearken not to hezekiah for thus saith the king of assyria make an agreement with me by a present and come out to me and then eat ye every man of his own vine and every one of his fig tree and drink ye every one the waters of his cistern
2ki1832 until i come and take you away to a land like your own land a land of corn and wine a land of bread and vineyards a land of oil olive and of honey that ye may live and not die and hearken not unto hezekiah when he persuadeth you saying the lord will deliver us
2ki1833 hath any of the gods of the nations delivered at all his land out of the hand of the king of assyria
2ki1834 where are the gods of hamath and of arpad where are the gods of sepharvaim hena and ivah have they delivered samaria out of mine hand
2ki1835 who are they among all the gods of the countries that have delivered their country out of mine hand that the lord should deliver jerusalem out of mine hand
2ki1836 but the people held their peace and answered him not a word for the king's commandment was saying answer him not
2ki1837 then came eliakim the son of hilkiah which was over the household and shebna the scribe and joah the son of asaph the recorder to hezekiah with their clothes rent and told him the words of rabshakeh
2ki191 and it came to pass when king hezekiah heard it that he rent his clothes and covered himself with sackcloth and went into the house of the lord
2ki192 and he sent eliakim which was over the household and shebna the scribe and the elders of the priests covered with sackcloth to isaiah the prophet the son of amoz
2ki193 and they said unto him thus saith hezekiah this day is a day of trouble and of rebuke and blasphemy for the children are come to the birth and there is not strength to bring forth
2ki194 it may be the lord thy god will hear all the words of rabshakeh whom the king of assyria his master hath sent to reproach the living god and will reprove the words which the lord thy god hath heard wherefore lift up thy prayer for the remnant that are left
2ki195 so the servants of king hezekiah came to isaiah
2ki196 and isaiah said unto them thus shall ye say to your master thus saith the lord be not afraid of the words which thou hast heard with which the servants of the king of assyria have blasphemed me
2ki197 behold i will send a blast upon him and he shall hear a rumour and shall return to his own land and i will cause him to fall by the sword in his own land
2ki198 so rabshakeh returned and found the king of assyria warring against libnah for he had heard that he was departed from lachish
2ki199 and when he heard say of tirhakah king of ethiopia behold he is come out to fight against thee he sent messengers again unto hezekiah saying
2ki1910 thus shall ye speak to hezekiah king of judah saying let not thy god in whom thou trustest deceive thee saying jerusalem shall not be delivered into the hand of the king of assyria
2ki1911 behold thou hast heard what the kings of assyria have done to all lands by destroying them utterly and shalt thou be delivered
2ki1912 have the gods of the nations delivered them which my fathers have destroyed as gozan and haran and rezeph and the children of eden which were in thelasar
2ki1913 where is the king of hamath and the king of arpad and the king of the city of sepharvaim of hena and ivah
2ki1914 and hezekiah received the letter of the hand of the messengers and read it and hezekiah went up into the house of the lord and spread it before the lord
2ki1915 and hezekiah prayed before the lord and said o lord god of israel which dwellest between the cherubims thou art the god even thou alone of all the kingdoms of the earth thou hast made heaven and earth
2ki1916 lord bow down thine ear and hear open lord thine eyes and see and hear the words of sennacherib which hath sent him to reproach the living god
2ki1917 of a truth lord the kings of assyria have destroyed the nations and their lands
2ki1918 and have cast their gods into the fire for they were no gods but the work of men's hands wood and stone therefore they have destroyed them
2ki1919 now therefore o lord our god i beseech thee save thou us out of his hand that all the kingdoms of the earth may know that thou art the lord god even thou only
2ki1920 then isaiah the son of amoz sent to hezekiah saying thus saith the lord god of israel that which thou hast prayed to me against sennacherib king of assyria i have heard
2ki1921 this is the word that the lord hath spoken concerning him the virgin the daughter of zion hath despised thee and laughed thee to scorn the daughter of jerusalem hath shaken her head at thee
2ki1922 whom hast thou reproached and blasphemed and against whom hast thou exalted thy voice and lifted up thine eyes on high even against the holy one of israel
2ki1923 by thy messengers thou hast reproached the lord and hast said with the multitude of my chariots i am come up to the height of the mountains to the sides of lebanon and will cut down the tall cedar trees thereof and the choice fir trees thereof and i will enter into the lodgings of his borders and into the forest of his carmel
2ki1924 i have digged and drunk strange waters and with the sole of my feet have i dried up all the rivers of besieged places
2ki1925 hast thou not heard long ago how i have done it and of ancient times that i have formed it now have i brought it to pass that thou shouldest be to lay waste fenced cities into ruinous heaps
2ki1926 therefore their inhabitants were of small power they were dismayed and confounded they were as the grass of the field and as the green herb as the grass on the house tops and as corn blasted before it be grown up
2ki1927 but i know thy abode and thy going out and thy coming in and thy rage against me
2ki1928 because thy rage against me and thy tumult is come up into mine ears therefore i will put my hook in thy nose and my bridle in thy lips and i will turn thee back by the way by which thou camest
2ki1929 and this shall be a sign unto thee ye shall eat this year such things as grow of themselves and in the second year that which springeth of the same and in the third year sow ye and reap and plant vineyards and eat the fruits thereof
2ki1930 and the remnant that is escaped of the house of judah shall yet again take root downward and bear fruit upward
2ki1931 for out of jerusalem shall go forth a remnant and they that escape out of mount zion the zeal of the lord of hosts shall do this
2ki1932 therefore thus saith the lord concerning the king of assyria he shall not come into this city nor shoot an arrow there nor come before it with shield nor cast a bank against it
2ki1933 by the way that he came by the same shall he return and shall not come into this city saith the lord
2ki1934 for i will defend this city to save it for mine own sake and for my servant david's sake
2ki1935 and it came to pass that night that the angel of the lord went out and smote in the camp of the assyrians an hundred fourscore and five thousand and when they arose early in the morning behold they were all dead corpses
2ki1936 so sennacherib king of assyria departed and went and returned and dwelt at nineveh
2ki1937 and it came to pass as he was worshipping in the house of nisroch his god that adrammelech and sharezer his sons smote him with the sword and they escaped into the land of armenia and esarhaddon his son reigned in his stead
2ki201 in those days was hezekiah sick unto death and the prophet isaiah the son of amoz came to him and said unto him thus saith the lord set thine house in order for thou shalt die and not live
2ki202 then he turned his face to the wall and prayed unto the lord saying
2ki203 i beseech thee o lord remember now how i have walked before thee in truth and with a perfect heart and have done that which is good in thy sight and hezekiah wept sore
2ki204 and it came to pass afore isaiah was gone out into the middle court that the word of the lord came to him saying
2ki205 turn again and tell hezekiah the captain of my people thus saith the lord the god of david thy father i have heard thy prayer i have seen thy tears behold i will heal thee on the third day thou shalt go up unto the house of the lord
2ki206 and i will add unto thy days fifteen years and i will deliver thee and this city out of the hand of the king of assyria and i will defend this city for mine own sake and for my servant david's sake
2ki207 and isaiah said take a lump of figs and they took and laid it on the boil and he recovered
2ki208 and hezekiah said unto isaiah what shall be the sign that the lord will heal me and that i shall go up into the house of the lord the third day
2ki209 and isaiah said this sign shalt thou have of the lord that the lord will do the thing that he hath spoken shall the shadow go forward ten degrees or go back ten degrees
2ki2010 and hezekiah answered it is a light thing for the shadow to go down ten degrees nay but let the shadow return backward ten degrees
2ki2011 and isaiah the prophet cried unto the lord and he brought the shadow ten degrees backward by which it had gone down in the dial of ahaz
2ki2012 at that time berodachbaladan the son of baladan king of babylon sent letters and a present unto hezekiah for he had heard that hezekiah had been sick
2ki2013 and hezekiah hearkened unto them and shewed them all the house of his precious things the silver and the gold and the spices and the precious ointment and all the house of his armour and all that was found in his treasures there was nothing in his house nor in all his dominion that hezekiah shewed them not
2ki2014 then came isaiah the prophet unto king hezekiah and said unto him what said these men and from whence came they unto thee and hezekiah said they are come from a far country even from babylon
2ki2015 and he said what have they seen in thine house and hezekiah answered all the things that are in mine house have they seen there is nothing among my treasures that i have not shewed them
2ki2016 and isaiah said unto hezekiah hear the word of the lord
2ki2017 behold the days come that all that is in thine house and that which thy fathers have laid up in store unto this day shall be carried into babylon nothing shall be left saith the lord
2ki2018 and of thy sons that shall issue from thee which thou shalt beget shall they take away and they shall be eunuchs in the palace of the king of babylon
2ki2019 then said hezekiah unto isaiah good is the word of the lord which thou hast spoken and he said is it not good if peace and truth be in my days
2ki2020 and the rest of the acts of hezekiah and all his might and how he made a pool and a conduit and brought water into the city are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of judah
2ki2021 and hezekiah slept with his fathers and manasseh his son reigned in his stead
2ki211 manasseh was twelve years old when he began to reign and reigned fifty and five years in jerusalem and his mother's name was hephzibah
2ki212 and he did that which was evil in the sight of the lord after the abominations of the heathen whom the lord cast out before the children of israel
2ki213 for he built up again the high places which hezekiah his father had destroyed and he reared up altars for baal and made a grove as did ahab king of israel and worshipped all the host of heaven and served them
2ki214 and he built altars in the house of the lord of which the lord said in jerusalem will i put my name
2ki215 and he built altars for all the host of heaven in the two courts of the house of the lord
2ki216 and he made his son pass through the fire and observed times and used enchantments and dealt with familiar spirits and wizards he wrought much wickedness in the sight of the lord to provoke him to anger
2ki217 and he set a graven image of the grove that he had made in the house of which the lord said to david and to solomon his son in this house and in jerusalem which i have chosen out of all tribes of israel will i put my name for ever
2ki218 neither will i make the feet of israel move any more out of the land which i gave their fathers only if they will observe to do according to all that i have commanded them and according to all the law that my servant moses commanded them
2ki219 but they hearkened not and manasseh seduced them to do more evil than did the nations whom the lord destroyed before the children of israel
2ki2110 and the lord spake by his servants the prophets saying
2ki2111 because manasseh king of judah hath done these abominations and hath done wickedly above all that the amorites did which were before him and hath made judah also to sin with his idols
2ki2112 therefore thus saith the lord god of israel behold i am bringing such evil upon jerusalem and judah that whosoever heareth of it both his ears shall tingle
2ki2113 and i will stretch over jerusalem the line of samaria and the plummet of the house of ahab and i will wipe jerusalem as a man wipeth a dish wiping it and turning it upside down
2ki2114 and i will forsake the remnant of mine inheritance and deliver them into the hand of their enemies and they shall become a prey and a spoil to all their enemies
2ki2115 because they have done that which was evil in my sight and have provoked me to anger since the day their fathers came forth out of egypt even unto this day
2ki2116 moreover manasseh shed innocent blood very much till he had filled jerusalem from one end to another beside his sin wherewith he made judah to sin in doing that which was evil in the sight of the lord
2ki2117 now the rest of the acts of manasseh and all that he did and his sin that he sinned are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of judah
2ki2118 and manasseh slept with his fathers and was buried in the garden of his own house in the garden of uzza and amon his son reigned in his stead
2ki2119 amon was twenty and two years old when he began to reign and he reigned two years in jerusalem and his mother's name was meshullemeth the daughter of haruz of jotbah
2ki2120 and he did that which was evil in the sight of the lord as his father manasseh did
2ki2121 and he walked in all the way that his father walked in and served the idols that his father served and worshipped them
2ki2122 and he forsook the lord god of his fathers and walked not in the way of the lord
2ki2123 and the servants of amon conspired against him and slew the king in his own house
2ki2124 and the people of the land slew all them that had conspired against king amon and the people of the land made josiah his son king in his stead
2ki2125 now the rest of the acts of amon which he did are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of judah
2ki2126 and he was buried in his sepulchre in the garden of uzza and josiah his son reigned in his stead
2ki221 josiah was eight years old when he began to reign and he reigned thirty and one years in jerusalem and his mother's name was jedidah the daughter of adaiah of boscath
2ki222 and he did that which was right in the sight of the lord and walked in all the way of david his father and turned not aside to the right hand or to the left
2ki223 and it came to pass in the eighteenth year of king josiah that the king sent shaphan the son of azaliah the son of meshullam the scribe to the house of the lord saying
2ki224 go up to hilkiah the high priest that he may sum the silver which is brought into the house of the lord which the keepers of the door have gathered of the people
2ki225 and let them deliver it into the hand of the doers of the work that have the oversight of the house of the lord and let them give it to the doers of the work which is in the house of the lord to repair the breaches of the house
2ki226 unto carpenters and builders and masons and to buy timber and hewn stone to repair the house
2ki227 howbeit there was no reckoning made with them of the money that was delivered into their hand because they dealt faithfully
2ki228 and hilkiah the high priest said unto shaphan the scribe i have found the book of the law in the house of the lord and hilkiah gave the book to shaphan and he read it
2ki229 and shaphan the scribe came to the king and brought the king word again and said thy servants have gathered the money that was found in the house and have delivered it into the hand of them that do the work that have the oversight of the house of the lord
2ki2210 and shaphan the scribe shewed the king saying hilkiah the priest hath delivered me a book and shaphan read it before the king
2ki2211 and it came to pass when the king had heard the words of the book of the law that he rent his clothes
2ki2212 and the king commanded hilkiah the priest and ahikam the son of shaphan and achbor the son of michaiah and shaphan the scribe and asahiah a servant of the king's saying
2ki2213 go ye enquire of the lord for me and for the people and for all judah concerning the words of this book that is found for great is the wrath of the lord that is kindled against us because our fathers have not hearkened unto the words of this book to do according unto all that which is written concerning us
2ki2214 so hilkiah the priest and ahikam and achbor and shaphan and asahiah went unto huldah the prophetess the wife of shallum the son of tikvah the son of harhas keeper of the wardrobe now she dwelt in jerusalem in the college and they communed with her
2ki2215 and she said unto them thus saith the lord god of israel tell the man that sent you to me
2ki2216 thus saith the lord behold i will bring evil upon this place and upon the inhabitants thereof even all the words of the book which the king of judah hath read
2ki2217 because they have forsaken me and have burned incense unto other gods that they might provoke me to anger with all the works of their hands therefore my wrath shall be kindled against this place and shall not be quenched
2ki2218 but to the king of judah which sent you to enquire of the lord thus shall ye say to him thus saith the lord god of israel as touching the words which thou hast heard
2ki2219 because thine heart was tender and thou hast humbled thyself before the lord when thou heardest what i spake against this place and against the inhabitants thereof that they should become a desolation and a curse and hast rent thy clothes and wept before me i also have heard thee saith the lord
2ki2220 behold therefore i will gather thee unto thy fathers and thou shalt be gathered into thy grave in peace and thine eyes shall not see all the evil which i will bring upon this place and they brought the king word again
2ki231 and the king sent and they gathered unto him all the elders of judah and of jerusalem
2ki232 and the king went up into the house of the lord and all the men of judah and all the inhabitants of jerusalem with him and the priests and the prophets and all the people both small and great and he read in their ears all the words of the book of the covenant which was found in the house of the lord
2ki233 and the king stood by a pillar and made a covenant before the lord to walk after the lord and to keep his commandments and his testimonies and his statutes with all their heart and all their soul to perform the words of this covenant that were written in this book and all the people stood to the covenant
2ki234 and the king commanded hilkiah the high priest and the priests of the second order and the keepers of the door to bring forth out of the temple of the lord all the vessels that were made for baal and for the grove and for all the host of heaven and he burned them without jerusalem in the fields of kidron and carried the ashes of them unto bethel
2ki235 and he put down the idolatrous priests whom the kings of judah had ordained to burn incense in the high places in the cities of judah and in the places round about jerusalem them also that burned incense unto baal to the sun and to the moon and to the planets and to all the host of heaven
2ki236 and he brought out the grove from the house of the lord without jerusalem unto the brook kidron and burned it at the brook kidron and stamped it small to powder and cast the powder thereof upon the graves of the children of the people
2ki237 and he brake down the houses of the sodomites that were by the house of the lord where the women wove hangings for the grove
2ki238 and he brought all the priests out of the cities of judah and defiled the high places where the priests had burned incense from geba to beersheba and brake down the high places of the gates that were in the entering in of the gate of joshua the governor of the city which were on a man's left hand at the gate of the city
2ki239 nevertheless the priests of the high places came not up to the altar of the lord in jerusalem but they did eat of the unleavened bread among their brethren
2ki2310 and he defiled topheth which is in the valley of the children of hinnom that no man might make his son or his daughter to pass through the fire to molech
2ki2311 and he took away the horses that the kings of judah had given to the sun at the entering in of the house of the lord by the chamber of nathanmelech the chamberlain which was in the suburbs and burned the chariots of the sun with fire
2ki2312 and the altars that were on the top of the upper chamber of ahaz which the kings of judah had made and the altars which manasseh had made in the two courts of the house of the lord did the king beat down and brake them down from thence and cast the dust of them into the brook kidron
2ki2313 and the high places that were before jerusalem which were on the right hand of the mount of corruption which solomon the king of israel had builded for ashtoreth the abomination of the zidonians and for chemosh the abomination of the moabites and for milcom the abomination of the children of ammon did the king defile
2ki2314 and he brake in pieces the images and cut down the groves and filled their places with the bones of men
2ki2315 moreover the altar that was at bethel and the high place which jeroboam the son of nebat who made israel to sin had made both that altar and the high place he brake down and burned the high place and stamped it small to powder and burned the grove
2ki2316 and as josiah turned himself he spied the sepulchres that were there in the mount and sent and took the bones out of the sepulchres and burned them upon the altar and polluted it according to the word of the lord which the man of god proclaimed who proclaimed these words
2ki2317 then he said what title is that that i see and the men of the city told him it is the sepulchre of the man of god which came from judah and proclaimed these things that thou hast done against the altar of bethel
2ki2318 and he said let him alone let no man move his bones so they let his bones alone with the bones of the prophet that came out of samaria
2ki2319 and all the houses also of the high places that were in the cities of samaria which the kings of israel had made to provoke the lord to anger josiah took away and did to them according to all the acts that he had done in bethel
2ki2320 and he slew all the priests of the high places that were there upon the altars and burned men's bones upon them and returned to jerusalem
2ki2321 and the king commanded all the people saying keep the passover unto the lord your god as it is written in the book of this covenant
2ki2322 surely there was not holden such a passover from the days of the judges that judged israel nor in all the days of the kings of israel nor of the kings of judah
2ki2323 but in the eighteenth year of king josiah wherein this passover was holden to the lord in jerusalem
2ki2324 moreover the workers with familiar spirits and the wizards and the images and the idols and all the abominations that were spied in the land of judah and in jerusalem did josiah put away that he might perform the words of the law which were written in the book that hilkiah the priest found in the house of the lord
2ki2325 and like unto him was there no king before him that turned to the lord with all his heart and with all his soul and with all his might according to all the law of moses neither after him arose there any like him
2ki2326 notwithstanding the lord turned not from the fierceness of his great wrath wherewith his anger was kindled against judah because of all the provocations that manasseh had provoked him withal
2ki2327 and the lord said i will remove judah also out of my sight as i have removed israel and will cast off this city jerusalem which i have chosen and the house of which i said my name shall be there
2ki2328 now the rest of the acts of josiah and all that he did are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of judah
2ki2329 in his days pharaohnechoh king of egypt went up against the king of assyria to the river euphrates and king josiah went against him and he slew him at megiddo when he had seen him
2ki2330 and his servants carried him in a chariot dead from megiddo and brought him to jerusalem and buried him in his own sepulchre and the people of the land took jehoahaz the son of josiah and anointed him and made him king in his father's stead
2ki2331 jehoahaz was twenty and three years old when he began to reign and he reigned three months in jerusalem and his mother's name was hamutal the daughter of jeremiah of libnah
2ki2332 and he did that which was evil in the sight of the lord according to all that his fathers had done
