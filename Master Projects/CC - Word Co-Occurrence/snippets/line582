valentine so by your circumstance i fear you'll prove
proteus tis love you cavil at i am not love
valentine love is your master for he masters you
 and he that is so yoked by a fool
 methinks should not be chronicled for wise
proteus yet writers say as in the sweetest bud
 the eating canker dwells so eating love
 inhabits in the finest wits of all
valentine and writers say as the most forward bud
 is eaten by the canker ere it blow
 even so by love the young and tender wit
 is turn'd to folly blasting in the bud
 losing his verdure even in the prime
 and all the fair effects of future hopes
 but wherefore waste i time to counsel thee
 that art a votary to fond desire
 once more adieu my father at the road
 expects my coming there to see me shipp'd
proteus and thither will i bring thee valentine
valentine sweet proteus no now let us take our leave
 to milan let me hear from thee by letters
 of thy success in love and what news else
 betideth here in absence of thy friend
 and likewise will visit thee with mine
proteus all happiness bechance to thee in milan
valentine as much to you at home and so farewell
 exit
proteus he after honour hunts i after love
 he leaves his friends to dignify them more
 i leave myself my friends and all for love
 thou julia thou hast metamorphosed me
 made me neglect my studies lose my time
 war with good counsel set the world at nought
 made wit with musing weak heart sick with thought
 enter speed
speed sir proteus save you saw you my master
proteus but now he parted hence to embark for milan
speed twenty to one then he is shipp'd already
 and i have play'd the sheep in losing him
proteus indeed a sheep doth very often stray
 an if the shepherd be a while away
speed you conclude that my master is a shepherd then
 and i a sheep
proteus i do
speed why then my horns are his horns whether i wake or sleep
proteus a silly answer and fitting well a sheep
speed this proves me still a sheep
proteus true and thy master a shepherd
speed nay that i can deny by a circumstance
proteus it shall go hard but i'll prove it by another
speed the shepherd seeks the sheep and not the sheep the
 shepherd but i seek my master and my master seeks
 not me therefore i am no sheep
proteus the sheep for fodder follow the shepherd the
 shepherd for food follows not the sheep thou for
 wages followest thy master thy master for wages
 follows not thee therefore thou art a sheep
speed such another proof will make me cry baa'
proteus but dost thou hear gavest thou my letter to julia
speed ay sir i a lost mutton gave your letter to her
 a laced mutton and she a laced mutton gave me a
 lost mutton nothing for my labour
proteus here's too small a pasture for such store of muttons
speed if the ground be overcharged you were best stick her
proteus nay in that you are astray twere best pound you
speed nay sir less than a pound shall serve me for
 carrying your letter
proteus you mistake i mean the pounda pinfold
speed from a pound to a pin fold it over and over
 tis threefold too little for carrying a letter to
 your lover
proteus but what said she
speed first nodding ay
proteus nodaywhy that's noddy
speed you mistook sir i say she did nod and you ask
 me if she did nod and i say ay'
proteus and that set together is noddy
speed now you have taken the pains to set it together
 take it for your pains
proteus no no you shall have it for bearing the letter
speed well i perceive i must be fain to bear with you
proteus why sir how do you bear with me
speed marry sir the letter very orderly having nothing
 but the word noddy for my pains
proteus beshrew me but you have a quick wit
speed and yet it cannot overtake your slow purse
proteus come come open the matter in brief what said she
speed open your purse that the money and the matter may
 be both at once delivered
proteus well sir here is for your pains what said she
speed truly sir i think you'll hardly win her
proteus why couldst thou perceive so much from her
speed sir i could perceive nothing at all from her no
 not so much as a ducat for delivering your letter
 and being so hard to me that brought your mind i
 fear she'll prove as hard to you in telling your
 mind give her no token but stones for she's as
 hard as steel
proteus what said she nothing
speed no not so much as take this for thy pains to
 testify your bounty i thank you you have testerned
 me in requital whereof henceforth carry your
 letters yourself and so sir i'll commend you to my master
proteus go go be gone to save your ship from wreck
 which cannot perish having thee aboard
 being destined to a drier death on shore
 exit speed
 i must go send some better messenger
 i fear my julia would not deign my lines
 receiving them from such a worthless post
 exit
 the two gentlemen of verona
act i
scene ii the same garden of julia's house
 enter julla and lucetta
julia but say lucetta now we are alone
 wouldst thou then counsel me to fall in love
lucetta ay madam so you stumble not unheedfully
julia of all the fair resort of gentlemen
 that every day with parle encounter me
 in thy opinion which is worthiest love
lucetta please you repeat their names i'll show my mind
 according to my shallow simple skill
julia what think'st thou of the fair sir eglamour
lucetta as of a knight wellspoken neat and fine
 but were i you he never should be mine
julia what think'st thou of the rich mercatio
lucetta well of his wealth but of himself so so
julia what think'st thou of the gentle proteus
lucetta lord lord to see what folly reigns in us
julia how now what means this passion at his name
lucetta pardon dear madam tis a passing shame
 that i unworthy body as i am
 should censure thus on lovely gentlemen
julia why not on proteus as of all the rest
lucetta then thus of many good i think him best
julia your reason
lucetta i have no other but a woman's reason
 i think him so because i think him so
julia and wouldst thou have me cast my love on him
lucetta ay if you thought your love not cast away
julia why he of all the rest hath never moved me
lucetta yet he of all the rest i think best loves ye
julia his little speaking shows his love but small
lucetta fire that's closest kept burns most of all
julia they do not love that do not show their love
lucetta o they love least that let men know their love
julia i would i knew his mind
lucetta peruse this paper madam
julia to julia say from whom
lucetta that the contents will show
julia say say who gave it thee
lucetta valentine's page and sent i think from proteus
 he would have given it you but i being in the way
 did in your name receive it pardon the
 fault i pray
julia now by my modesty a goodly broker
 dare you presume to harbour wanton lines
 to whisper and conspire against my youth
 now trust me tis an office of great worth
 and you an officer fit for the place
 or else return no more into my sight
lucetta to plead for love deserves more fee than hate
julia will ye be gone
lucetta that you may ruminate
 exit
julia and yet i would i had o'erlooked the letter
 it were a shame to call her back again
 and pray her to a fault for which i chid her
 what a fool is she that knows i am a maid
 and would not force the letter to my view
 since maids in modesty say no to that
 which they would have the profferer construe ay'
 fie fie how wayward is this foolish love
 that like a testy babe will scratch the nurse
 and presently all humbled kiss the rod
 how churlishly i chid lucetta hence
 when willingly i would have had her here
 how angerly i taught my brow to frown
 when inward joy enforced my heart to smile
 my penance is to call lucetta back
 and ask remission for my folly past
 what ho lucetta
 reenter lucetta
lucetta what would your ladyship
julia is't near dinnertime
lucetta i would it were
 that you might kill your stomach on your meat
 and not upon your maid
julia what is't that you took up so gingerly
lucetta nothing
julia why didst thou stoop then
lucetta to take a paper up that i let fall
julia and is that paper nothing
lucetta nothing concerning me
julia then let it lie for those that it concerns
lucetta madam it will not lie where it concerns
 unless it have a false interpeter
julia some love of yours hath writ to you in rhyme
lucetta that i might sing it madam to a tune
