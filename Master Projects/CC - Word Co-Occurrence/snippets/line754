northumberland your grace mistakes only to be brief
 left i his title out
duke of york the time hath been
 would you have been so brief with him he would
 have been so brief with you to shorten you
 for taking so the head your whole head's length
henry bolingbroke mistake not uncle further than you should
duke of york take not good cousin further than you should
 lest you mistake the heavens are o'er our heads
henry bolingbroke i know it uncle and oppose not myself
 against their will but who comes here
 enter henry percy
 welcome harry what will not this castle yield
henry percy the castle royally is mann'd my lord
 against thy entrance
henry bolingbroke royally
 why it contains no king
henry percy yes my good lord
 it doth contain a king king richard lies
 within the limits of yon lime and stone
 and with him are the lord aumerle lord salisbury
 sir stephen scroop besides a clergyman
 of holy reverence who i cannot learn
northumberland o belike it is the bishop of carlisle
henry bolingbroke noble lords
 go to the rude ribs of that ancient castle
 through brazen trumpet send the breath of parley
 into his ruin'd ears and thus deliver
 henry bolingbroke
 on both his knees doth kiss king richard's hand
 and sends allegiance and true faith of heart
 to his most royal person hither come
 even at his feet to lay my arms and power
 provided that my banishment repeal'd
 and lands restored again be freely granted
 if not i'll use the advantage of my power
 and lay the summer's dust with showers of blood
 rain'd from the wounds of slaughter'd englishmen
 the which how far off from the mind of bolingbroke
 it is such crimson tempest should bedrench
 the fresh green lap of fair king richard's land
 my stooping duty tenderly shall show
 go signify as much while here we march
 upon the grassy carpet of this plain
 let's march without the noise of threatening drum
 that from this castle's tatter'd battlements
 our fair appointments may be well perused
 methinks king richard and myself should meet
 with no less terror than the elements
 of fire and water when their thundering shock
 at meeting tears the cloudy cheeks of heaven
 be he the fire i'll be the yielding water
 the rage be his whilst on the earth i rain
 my waters on the earth and not on him
 march on and mark king richard how he looks
 parle without and answer within then a flourish
 enter on the walls king richard ii the bishop of
 carlisle duke of aumerle sir stephen scroop and
 earl of salisbury
 see see king richard doth himself appear
 as doth the blushing discontented sun
 from out the fiery portal of the east
 when he perceives the envious clouds are bent
 to dim his glory and to stain the track
 of his bright passage to the occident
duke of york yet looks he like a king behold his eye
 as bright as is the eagle's lightens forth
 controlling majesty alack alack for woe
 that any harm should stain so fair a show
king richard ii we are amazed and thus long have we stood
 to watch the fearful bending of thy knee
 to northumberland
 because we thought ourself thy lawful king
 and if we be how dare thy joints forget
 to pay their awful duty to our presence
 if we be not show us the hand of god
 that hath dismissed us from our stewardship
 for well we know no hand of blood and bone
 can gripe the sacred handle of our sceptre
 unless he do profane steal or usurp
 and though you think that all as you have done
 have torn their souls by turning them from us
 and we are barren and bereft of friends
 yet know my master god omnipotent
 is mustering in his clouds on our behalf
 armies of pestilence and they shall strike
 your children yet unborn and unbegot
 that lift your vassal hands against my head
 and threat the glory of my precious crown
 tell bolingbrokefor yond methinks he stands
 that every stride he makes upon my land
 is dangerous treason he is come to open
 the purple testament of bleeding war
 but ere the crown he looks for live in peace
 ten thousand bloody crowns of mothers sons
 shall ill become the flower of england's face
 change the complexion of her maidpale peace
 to scarlet indignation and bedew
 her pastures grass with faithful english blood
northumberland the king of heaven forbid our lord the king
 should so with civil and uncivil arms
 be rush'd upon thy thrice noble cousin
 harry bolingbroke doth humbly kiss thy hand
 and by the honourable tomb he swears
 that stands upon your royal grandsire's bones
 and by the royalties of both your bloods
 currents that spring from one most gracious head
 and by the buried hand of warlike gaunt
 and by the worth and honour of himself
 comprising all that may be sworn or said
 his coming hither hath no further scope
 than for his lineal royalties and to beg
 enfranchisement immediate on his knees
 which on thy royal party granted once
 his glittering arms he will commend to rust
 his barbed steeds to stables and his heart
 to faithful service of your majesty
 this swears he as he is a prince is just
 and as i am a gentleman i credit him
king richard ii northumberland say thus the king returns
 his noble cousin is right welcome hither
 and all the number of his fair demands
 shall be accomplish'd without contradiction
 with all the gracious utterance thou hast
 speak to his gentle hearing kind commends
 we do debase ourselves cousin do we not
 to duke of aumerle
 to look so poorly and to speak so fair
 shall we call back northumberland and send
 defiance to the traitor and so die
duke of aumerle no good my lord let's fight with gentle words
 till time lend friends and friends their helpful swords
king richard ii o god o god that e'er this tongue of mine
 that laid the sentence of dread banishment
 on yon proud man should take it off again
 with words of sooth o that i were as great
 as is my grief or lesser than my name
 or that i could forget what i have been
 or not remember what i must be now
 swell'st thou proud heart i'll give thee scope to beat
 since foes have scope to beat both thee and me
duke of aumerle northumberland comes back from bolingbroke
king richard ii what must the king do now must he submit
 the king shall do it must he be deposed
 the king shall be contented must he lose
 the name of king o god's name let it go
 i'll give my jewels for a set of beads
 my gorgeous palace for a hermitage
 my gay apparel for an almsman's gown
 my figured goblets for a dish of wood
 my sceptre for a palmer's walking staff
 my subjects for a pair of carved saints
 and my large kingdom for a little grave
 a little little grave an obscure grave
 or i'll be buried in the king's highway
 some way of common trade where subjects feet
 may hourly trample on their sovereign's head
 for on my heart they tread now whilst i live
 and buried once why not upon my head
 aumerle thou weep'st my tenderhearted cousin
 we'll make foul weather with despised tears
 our sighs and they shall lodge the summer corn
 and make a dearth in this revolting land
 or shall we play the wantons with our woes
 and make some pretty match with shedding tears
 as thus to drop them still upon one place
 till they have fretted us a pair of graves
 within the earth and therein laidthere lies
 two kinsmen digg'd their graves with weeping eyes
 would not this ill do well well well i see
 i talk but idly and you laugh at me
 most mighty prince my lord northumberland
 what says king bolingbroke will his majesty
 give richard leave to live till richard die
 you make a leg and bolingbroke says ay
northumberland my lord in the base court he doth attend
 to speak with you may it please you to come down
king richard ii down down i come like glistering phaethon
 wanting the manage of unruly jades
 in the base court base court where kings grow base
 to come at traitors calls and do them grace
 in the base court come down down court
 down king
 for nightowls shriek where mounting larks
 should sing
 exeunt from above
henry bolingbroke what says his majesty
northumberland sorrow and grief of heart
 makes him speak fondly like a frantic man
 yet he is come
 enter king richard and his attendants below
henry bolingbroke stand all apart
 and show fair duty to his majesty
 he kneels down
 my gracious lord
king richard ii fair cousin you debase your princely knee
 to make the base earth proud with kissing it
 me rather had my heart might feel your love
 than my unpleased eye see your courtesy
 up cousin up your heart is up i know
