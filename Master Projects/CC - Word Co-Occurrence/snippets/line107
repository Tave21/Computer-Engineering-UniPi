the hand of the lord was upon me and carried me out in the spirit of the lord and set me down in the midst of the valley which was full of bones
and caused me to pass by them round about and behold there were very many in the open valley and lo they were very dry
and he said unto me son of man can these bones live and i answered o lord god thou knowest
again he said unto me prophesy upon these bones and say unto them o ye dry bones hear the word of the lord
thus saith the lord god unto these bones behold i will cause breath to enter into you and ye shall live
and i will lay sinews upon you and will bring up flesh upon you and cover you with skin and put breath in you and ye shall live and ye shall know that i am the lord
so i prophesied as i was commanded and as i prophesied there was a noise and behold a shaking and the bones came together bone to his bone
and when i beheld lo the sinews and the flesh came up upon them and the skin covered them above but there was no breath in them
then said he unto me prophesy unto the wind prophesy son of man and say to the wind thus saith the lord god come from the four winds o breath and breathe upon these slain that they may live
so i prophesied as he commanded me and the breath came into them and they lived and stood up upon their feet an exceeding great army
then he said unto me son of man these bones are the whole house of israel behold they say our bones are dried and our hope is lost we are cut off for our parts
therefore prophesy and say unto them thus saith the lord god behold o my people i will open your graves and cause you to come up out of your graves and bring you into the land of israel
and ye shall know that i am the lord when i have opened your graves o my people and brought you up out of your graves
and shall put my spirit in you and ye shall live and i shall place you in your own land then shall ye know that i the lord have spoken it and performed it saith the lord
the word of the lord came again unto me saying
moreover thou son of man take thee one stick and write upon it for judah and for the children of israel his companions then take another stick and write upon it for joseph the stick of ephraim and for all the house of israel his companions
and join them one to another into one stick and they shall become one in thine hand
and when the children of thy people shall speak unto thee saying wilt thou not shew us what thou meanest by these
say unto them thus saith the lord god behold i will take the stick of joseph which is in the hand of ephraim and the tribes of israel his fellows and will put them with him even with the stick of judah and make them one stick and they shall be one in mine hand
and the sticks whereon thou writest shall be in thine hand before their eyes
and say unto them thus saith the lord god behold i will take the children of israel from among the heathen whither they be gone and will gather them on every side and bring them into their own land
and i will make them one nation in the land upon the mountains of israel and one king shall be king to them all and they shall be no more two nations neither shall they be divided into two kingdoms any more at all
neither shall they defile themselves any more with their idols nor with their detestable things nor with any of their transgressions but i will save them out of all their dwellingplaces wherein they have sinned and will cleanse them so shall they be my people and i will be their god
and david my servant shall be king over them and they all shall have one shepherd they shall also walk in my judgments and observe my statutes and do them
and they shall dwell in the land that i have given unto jacob my servant wherein your fathers have dwelt and they shall dwell therein even they and their children and their children's children for ever and my servant david shall be their prince for ever
moreover i will make a covenant of peace with them it shall be an everlasting covenant with them and i will place them and multiply them and will set my sanctuary in the midst of them for evermore
my tabernacle also shall be with them yea i will be their god and they shall be my people
and the heathen shall know that i the lord do sanctify israel when my sanctuary shall be in the midst of them for evermore
and the word of the lord came unto me saying
son of man set thy face against gog the land of magog the chief prince of meshech and tubal and prophesy against him
and say thus saith the lord god behold i am against thee o gog the chief prince of meshech and tubal
and i will turn thee back and put hooks into thy jaws and i will bring thee forth and all thine army horses and horsemen all of them clothed with all sorts of armour even a great company with bucklers and shields all of them handling swords
persia ethiopia and libya with them all of them with shield and helmet
gomer and all his bands the house of togarmah of the north quarters and all his bands and many people with thee
be thou prepared and prepare for thyself thou and all thy company that are assembled unto thee and be thou a guard unto them
after many days thou shalt be visited in the latter years thou shalt come into the land that is brought back from the sword and is gathered out of many people against the mountains of israel which have been always waste but it is brought forth out of the nations and they shall dwell safely all of them
thou shalt ascend and come like a storm thou shalt be like a cloud to cover the land thou and all thy bands and many people with thee
thus saith the lord god it shall also come to pass that at the same time shall things come into thy mind and thou shalt think an evil thought
and thou shalt say i will go up to the land of unwalled villages i will go to them that are at rest that dwell safely all of them dwelling without walls and having neither bars nor gates
to take a spoil and to take a prey to turn thine hand upon the desolate places that are now inhabited and upon the people that are gathered out of the nations which have gotten cattle and goods that dwell in the midst of the land
sheba and dedan and the merchants of tarshish with all the young lions thereof shall say unto thee art thou come to take a spoil hast thou gathered thy company to take a prey to carry away silver and gold to take away cattle and goods to take a great spoil
therefore son of man prophesy and say unto gog thus saith the lord god in that day when my people of israel dwelleth safely shalt thou not know it
and thou shalt come from thy place out of the north parts thou and many people with thee all of them riding upon horses a great company and a mighty army
and thou shalt come up against my people of israel as a cloud to cover the land it shall be in the latter days and i will bring thee against my land that the heathen may know me when i shall be sanctified in thee o gog before their eyes
thus saith the lord god art thou he of whom i have spoken in old time by my servants the prophets of israel which prophesied in those days many years that i would bring thee against them
and it shall come to pass at the same time when gog shall come against the land of israel saith the lord god that my fury shall come up in my face
for in my jealousy and in the fire of my wrath have i spoken surely in that day there shall be a great shaking in the land of israel
so that the fishes of the sea and the fowls of the heaven and the beasts of the field and all creeping things that creep upon the earth and all the men that are upon the face of the earth shall shake at my presence and the mountains shall be thrown down and the steep places shall fall and every wall shall fall to the ground
and i will call for a sword against him throughout all my mountains saith the lord god every man's sword shall be against his brother
and i will plead against him with pestilence and with blood and i will rain upon him and upon his bands and upon the many people that are with him an overflowing rain and great hailstones fire and brimstone
thus will i magnify myself and sanctify myself and i will be known in the eyes of many nations and they shall know that i am the lord
therefore thou son of man prophesy against gog and say thus saith the lord god behold i am against thee o gog the chief prince of meshech and tubal
and i will turn thee back and leave but the sixth part of thee and will cause thee to come up from the north parts and will bring thee upon the mountains of israel
and i will smite thy bow out of thy left hand and will cause thine arrows to fall out of thy right hand
thou shalt fall upon the mountains of israel thou and all thy bands and the people that is with thee i will give thee unto the ravenous birds of every sort and to the beasts of the field to be devoured
thou shalt fall upon the open field for i have spoken it saith the lord god
and i will send a fire on magog and among them that dwell carelessly in the isles and they shall know that i am the lord
so will i make my holy name known in the midst of my people israel and i will not let them pollute my holy name any more and the heathen shall know that i am the lord the holy one in israel
behold it is come and it is done saith the lord god this is the day whereof i have spoken
and they that dwell in the cities of israel shall go forth and shall set on fire and burn the weapons both the shields and the bucklers the bows and the arrows and the handstaves and the spears and they shall burn them with fire seven years
so that they shall take no wood out of the field neither cut down any out of the forests for they shall burn the weapons with fire and they shall spoil those that spoiled them and rob those that robbed them saith the lord god
and it shall come to pass in that day that i will give unto gog a place there of graves in israel the valley of the passengers on the east of the sea and it shall stop the noses of the passengers and there shall they bury gog and all his multitude and they shall call it the valley of hamongog
and seven months shall the house of israel be burying of them that they may cleanse the land
yea all the people of the land shall bury them and it shall be to them a renown the day that i shall be glorified saith the lord god
and they shall sever out men of continual employment passing through the land to bury with the passengers those that remain upon the face of the earth to cleanse it after the end of seven months shall they search
and the passengers that pass through the land when any seeth a man's bone then shall he set up a sign by it till the buriers have buried it in the valley of hamongog
and also the name of the city shall be hamonah thus shall they cleanse the land
and thou son of man thus saith the lord god speak unto every feathered fowl and to every beast of the field assemble yourselves and come gather yourselves on every side to my sacrifice that i do sacrifice for you even a great sacrifice upon the mountains of israel that ye may eat flesh and drink blood
ye shall eat the flesh of the mighty and drink the blood of the princes of the earth of rams of lambs and of goats of bullocks all of them fatlings of bashan
and ye shall eat fat till ye be full and drink blood till ye be drunken of my sacrifice which i have sacrificed for you
thus ye shall be filled at my table with horses and chariots with mighty men and with all men of war saith the lord god
and i will set my glory among the heathen and all the heathen shall see my judgment that i have executed and my hand that i have laid upon them
so the house of israel shall know that i am the lord their god from that day and forward
and the heathen shall know that the house of israel went into captivity for their iniquity because they trespassed against me therefore hid i my face from them and gave them into the hand of their enemies so fell they all by the sword
according to their uncleanness and according to their transgressions have i done unto them and hid my face from them
therefore thus saith the lord god now will i bring again the captivity of jacob and have mercy upon the whole house of israel and will be jealous for my holy name
after that they have borne their shame and all their trespasses whereby they have trespassed against me when they dwelt safely in their land and none made them afraid
when i have brought them again from the people and gathered them out of their enemies lands and am sanctified in them in the sight of many nations
then shall they know that i am the lord their god which caused them to be led into captivity among the heathen but i have gathered them unto their own land and have left none of them any more there
neither will i hide my face any more from them for i have poured out my spirit upon the house of israel saith the lord god
in the five and twentieth year of our captivity in the beginning of the year in the tenth day of the month in the fourteenth year after that the city was smitten in the selfsame day the hand of the lord was upon me and brought me thither
in the visions of god brought he me into the land of israel and set me upon a very high mountain by which was as the frame of a city on the south
and he brought me thither and behold there was a man whose appearance was like the appearance of brass with a line of flax in his hand and a measuring reed and he stood in the gate

and without the inner gate were the chambers of the singers in the inner court which was at the side of the north gate and their prospect was toward the south one at the side of the east gate having the prospect toward the north
and he said unto me this chamber whose prospect is toward the south is for the priests the keepers of the charge of the house
and the chamber whose prospect is toward the north is for the priests the keepers of the charge of the altar these are the sons of zadok among the sons of levi which come near to the lord to minister unto him

and the breadth of the door was ten cubits and the sides of the door were five cubits on the one side and five cubits on the other side and he measured the length thereof forty cubits and the breadth twenty cubits
then went he inward and measured the post of the door two cubits and the door six cubits and the breadth of the door seven cubits
so he measured the length thereof twenty cubits and the breadth twenty cubits before the temple and he said unto me this is the most holy place
after he measured the wall of the house six cubits and the breadth of every side chamber four cubits round about the house on every side
and the side chambers were three one over another and thirty in order and they entered into the wall which was of the house for the side chambers round about that they might have hold but they had not hold in the wall of the house
and there was an enlarging and a winding about still upward to the side chambers for the winding about of the house went still upward round about the house therefore the breadth of the house was still upward and so increased from the lowest chamber to the highest by the midst
i saw also the height of the house round about the foundations of the side chambers were a full reed of six great cubits
the thickness of the wall which was for the side chamber without was five cubits and that which was left was the place of the side chambers that were within
and between the chambers was the wideness of twenty cubits round about the house on every side
and the doors of the side chambers were toward the place that was left one door toward the north and another door toward the south and the breadth of the place that was left was five cubits round about
now the building that was before the separate place at the end toward the west was seventy cubits broad and the wall of the building was five cubits thick round about and the length thereof ninety cubits
so he measured the house an hundred cubits long and the separate place and the building with the walls thereof an hundred cubits long
also the breadth of the face of the house and of the separate place toward the east an hundred cubits
and he measured the length of the building over against the separate place which was behind it and the galleries thereof on the one side and on the other side an hundred cubits with the inner temple and the porches of the court
the door posts and the narrow windows and the galleries round about on their three stories over against the door cieled with wood round about and from the ground up to the windows and the windows were covered

before the length of an hundred cubits was the north door and the breadth was fifty cubits
over against the twenty cubits which were for the inner court and over against the pavement which was for the utter court was gallery against gallery in three stories
and before the chambers was a walk of ten cubits breadth inward a way of one cubit and their doors toward the north
now the upper chambers were shorter for the galleries were higher than these than the lower and than the middlemost of the building
for they were in three stories but had not pillars as the pillars of the courts therefore the building was straitened more than the lowest and the middlemost from the ground
and the wall that was without over against the chambers toward the utter court on the forepart of the chambers the length thereof was fifty cubits
for the length of the chambers that were in the utter court was fifty cubits and lo before the temple were an hundred cubits
and from under these chambers was the entry on the east side as one goeth into them from the utter court
the chambers were in the thickness of the wall of the court toward the east over against the separate place and over against the building
and the way before them was like the appearance of the chambers which were toward the north as long as they and as broad as they and all their goings out were both according to their fashions and according to their doors
and according to the doors of the chambers that were toward the south was a door in the head of the way even the way directly before the wall toward the east as one entereth into them
then said he unto me the north chambers and the south chambers which are before the separate place they be holy chambers where the priests that approach unto the lord shall eat the most holy things there shall they lay the most holy things and the meat offering and the sin offering and the trespass offering for the place is holy
when the priests enter therein then shall they not go out of the holy place into the utter court but there they shall lay their garments wherein they minister for they are holy and shall put on other garments and shall approach to those things which are for the people
now when he had made an end of measuring the inner house he brought me forth toward the gate whose prospect is toward the east and measured it round about
he measured the east side with the measuring reed five hundred reeds with the measuring reed round about
he measured the north side five hundred reeds with the measuring reed round about
he measured the south side five hundred reeds with the measuring reed
he turned about to the west side and measured five hundred reeds with the measuring reed
he measured it by the four sides it had a wall round about five hundred reeds long and five hundred broad to make a separation between the sanctuary and the profane place
afterward he brought me to the gate even the gate that looketh toward the east
and behold the glory of the god of israel came from the way of the east and his voice was like a noise of many waters and the earth shined with his glory
and it was according to the appearance of the vision which i saw even according to the vision that i saw when i came to destroy the city and the visions were like the vision that i saw by the river chebar and i fell upon my face
and the glory of the lord came into the house by the way of the gate whose prospect is toward the east
so the spirit took me up and brought me into the inner court and behold the glory of the lord filled the house
and i heard him speaking unto me out of the house and the man stood by me
and he said unto me son of man the place of my throne and the place of the soles of my feet where i will dwell in the midst of the children of israel for ever and my holy name shall the house of israel no more defile neither they nor their kings by their whoredom nor by the carcases of their kings in their high places
in their setting of their threshold by my thresholds and their post by my posts and the wall between me and them they have even defiled my holy name by their abominations that they have committed wherefore i have consumed them in mine anger
now let them put away their whoredom and the carcases of their kings far from me and i will dwell in the midst of them for ever
thou son of man shew the house to the house of israel that they may be ashamed of their iniquities and let them measure the pattern
and if they be ashamed of all that they have done shew them the form of the house and the fashion thereof and the goings out thereof and the comings in thereof and all the forms thereof and all the ordinances thereof and all the forms thereof and all the laws thereof and write it in their sight that they may keep the whole form thereof and all the ordinances thereof and do them
this is the law of the house upon the top of the mountain the whole limit thereof round about shall be most holy behold this is the law of the house
and these are the measures of the altar after the cubits the cubit is a cubit and an hand breadth even the bottom shall be a cubit and the breadth a cubit and the border thereof by the edge thereof round about shall be a span and this shall be the higher place of the altar
and from the bottom upon the ground even to the lower settle shall be two cubits and the breadth one cubit and from the lesser settle even to the greater settle shall be four cubits and the breadth one cubit
so the altar shall be four cubits and from the altar and upward shall be four horns

and the settle shall be fourteen cubits long and fourteen broad in the four squares thereof and the border about it shall be half a cubit and the bottom thereof shall be a cubit about and his stairs shall look toward the east
and he said unto me son of man thus saith the lord god these are the ordinances of the altar in the day when they shall make it to offer burnt offerings thereon and to sprinkle blood thereon
and thou shalt give to the priests the levites that be of the seed of zadok which approach unto me to minister unto me saith the lord god a young bullock for a sin offering
and thou shalt take of the blood thereof and put it on the four horns of it and on the four corners of the settle and upon the border round about thus shalt thou cleanse and purge it
thou shalt take the bullock also of the sin offering and he shall burn it in the appointed place of the house without the sanctuary
and on the second day thou shalt offer a kid of the goats without blemish for a sin offering and they shall cleanse the altar as they did cleanse it with the bullock
when thou hast made an end of cleansing it thou shalt offer a young bullock without blemish and a ram out of the flock without blemish
and thou shalt offer them before the lord and the priests shall cast salt upon them and they shall offer them up for a burnt offering unto the lord
seven days shalt thou prepare every day a goat for a sin offering they shall also prepare a young bullock and a ram out of the flock without blemish
