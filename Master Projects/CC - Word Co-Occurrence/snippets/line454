salarino my wind cooling my broth
 would blow me to an ague when i thought
 what harm a wind too great at sea might do
 i should not see the sandy hourglass run
 but i should think of shallows and of flats
 and see my wealthy andrew dock'd in sand
 vailing her hightop lower than her ribs
 to kiss her burial should i go to church
 and see the holy edifice of stone
 and not bethink me straight of dangerous rocks
 which touching but my gentle vessel's side
 would scatter all her spices on the stream
 enrobe the roaring waters with my silks
 and in a word but even now worth this
 and now worth nothing shall i have the thought
 to think on this and shall i lack the thought
 that such a thing bechanced would make me sad
 but tell not me i know antonio
 is sad to think upon his merchandise
antonio believe me no i thank my fortune for it
 my ventures are not in one bottom trusted
 nor to one place nor is my whole estate
 upon the fortune of this present year
 therefore my merchandise makes me not sad
salarino why then you are in love
antonio fie fie
salarino not in love neither then let us say you are sad
 because you are not merry and twere as easy
 for you to laugh and leap and say you are merry
 because you are not sad now by twoheaded janus
 nature hath framed strange fellows in her time
 some that will evermore peep through their eyes
 and laugh like parrots at a bagpiper
 and other of such vinegar aspect
 that they'll not show their teeth in way of smile
 though nestor swear the jest be laughable
 enter bassanio lorenzo and gratiano
salanio here comes bassanio your most noble kinsman
 gratiano and lorenzo fare ye well
 we leave you now with better company
salarino i would have stay'd till i had made you merry
 if worthier friends had not prevented me
antonio your worth is very dear in my regard
 i take it your own business calls on you
 and you embrace the occasion to depart
salarino good morrow my good lords
bassanio good signiors both when shall we laugh say when
 you grow exceeding strange must it be so
salarino we'll make our leisures to attend on yours
 exeunt salarino and salanio
lorenzo my lord bassanio since you have found antonio
 we two will leave you but at dinnertime
 i pray you have in mind where we must meet
bassanio i will not fail you
gratiano you look not well signior antonio
 you have too much respect upon the world
 they lose it that do buy it with much care
 believe me you are marvellously changed
antonio i hold the world but as the world gratiano
 a stage where every man must play a part
 and mine a sad one
gratiano let me play the fool
 with mirth and laughter let old wrinkles come
 and let my liver rather heat with wine
 than my heart cool with mortifying groans
 why should a man whose blood is warm within
 sit like his grandsire cut in alabaster
 sleep when he wakes and creep into the jaundice
 by being peevish i tell thee what antonio
 i love thee and it is my love that speaks
 there are a sort of men whose visages
 do cream and mantle like a standing pond
 and do a wilful stillness entertain
 with purpose to be dress'd in an opinion
 of wisdom gravity profound conceit
 as who should say i am sir oracle
 and when i ope my lips let no dog bark'
 o my antonio i do know of these
 that therefore only are reputed wise
 for saying nothing when i am very sure
 if they should speak would almost damn those ears
 which hearing them would call their brothers fools
 i'll tell thee more of this another time
 but fish not with this melancholy bait
 for this fool gudgeon this opinion
 come good lorenzo fare ye well awhile
 i'll end my exhortation after dinner
lorenzo well we will leave you then till dinnertime
 i must be one of these same dumb wise men
 for gratiano never lets me speak
gratiano well keep me company but two years moe
 thou shalt not know the sound of thine own tongue
antonio farewell i'll grow a talker for this gear
gratiano thanks i faith for silence is only commendable
 in a neat's tongue dried and a maid not vendible
 exeunt gratiano and lorenzo
antonio is that any thing now
bassanio gratiano speaks an infinite deal of nothing more
 than any man in all venice his reasons are as two
 grains of wheat hid in two bushels of chaff you
 shall seek all day ere you find them and when you
 have them they are not worth the search
antonio well tell me now what lady is the same
 to whom you swore a secret pilgrimage
 that you today promised to tell me of
bassanio tis not unknown to you antonio
 how much i have disabled mine estate
 by something showing a more swelling port
 than my faint means would grant continuance
 nor do i now make moan to be abridged
 from such a noble rate but my chief care
 is to come fairly off from the great debts
 wherein my time something too prodigal
 hath left me gaged to you antonio
 i owe the most in money and in love
 and from your love i have a warranty
 to unburden all my plots and purposes
 how to get clear of all the debts i owe
antonio i pray you good bassanio let me know it
 and if it stand as you yourself still do
 within the eye of honour be assured
 my purse my person my extremest means
 lie all unlock'd to your occasions
bassanio in my schooldays when i had lost one shaft
 i shot his fellow of the selfsame flight
 the selfsame way with more advised watch
 to find the other forth and by adventuring both
 i oft found both i urge this childhood proof
 because what follows is pure innocence
 i owe you much and like a wilful youth
 that which i owe is lost but if you please
 to shoot another arrow that self way
 which you did shoot the first i do not doubt
 as i will watch the aim or to find both
 or bring your latter hazard back again
 and thankfully rest debtor for the first
antonio you know me well and herein spend but time
 to wind about my love with circumstance
 and out of doubt you do me now more wrong
 in making question of my uttermost
 than if you had made waste of all i have
 then do but say to me what i should do
 that in your knowledge may by me be done
 and i am prest unto it therefore speak
bassanio in belmont is a lady richly left
 and she is fair and fairer than that word
 of wondrous virtues sometimes from her eyes
 i did receive fair speechless messages
 her name is portia nothing undervalued
 to cato's daughter brutus portia
 nor is the wide world ignorant of her worth
 for the four winds blow in from every coast
 renowned suitors and her sunny locks
 hang on her temples like a golden fleece
 which makes her seat of belmont colchos strand
 and many jasons come in quest of her
 o my antonio had i but the means
 to hold a rival place with one of them
 i have a mind presages me such thrift
 that i should questionless be fortunate
antonio thou know'st that all my fortunes are at sea
 neither have i money nor commodity
 to raise a present sum therefore go forth
 try what my credit can in venice do
 that shall be rack'd even to the uttermost
 to furnish thee to belmont to fair portia
 go presently inquire and so will i
 where money is and i no question make
 to have it of my trust or for my sake
 exeunt
 the merchant of venice
act i
scene ii belmont a room in portia's house
 enter portia and nerissa
portia by my troth nerissa my little body is aweary of
 this great world
nerissa you would be sweet madam if your miseries were in
 the same abundance as your good fortunes are and
 yet for aught i see they are as sick that surfeit
 with too much as they that starve with nothing it
 is no mean happiness therefore to be seated in the
 mean superfluity comes sooner by white hairs but
 competency lives longer
portia good sentences and well pronounced
nerissa they would be better if well followed
portia if to do were as easy as to know what were good to
 do chapels had been churches and poor men's
 cottages princes palaces it is a good divine that
 follows his own instructions i can easier teach
 twenty what were good to be done than be one of the
 twenty to follow mine own teaching the brain may
 devise laws for the blood but a hot temper leaps
 o'er a cold decree such a hare is madness the
 youth to skip o'er the meshes of good counsel the
 cripple but this reasoning is not in the fashion to
 choose me a husband o me the word choose i may
 neither choose whom i would nor refuse whom i
 dislike so is the will of a living daughter curbed
 by the will of a dead father is it not hard
 nerissa that i cannot choose one nor refuse none
