clown i would you did but see how it chafes how it rages
 how it takes up the shore but that's not the
 point o the most piteous cry of the poor souls
 sometimes to see em and not to see em now the
 ship boring the moon with her mainmast and anon
 swallowed with yest and froth as you'ld thrust a
 cork into a hogshead and then for the
 landservice to see how the bear tore out his
 shoulderbone how he cried to me for help and said
 his name was antigonus a nobleman but to make an
 end of the ship to see how the sea flapdragoned
 it but first how the poor souls roared and the
 sea mocked them and how the poor gentleman roared
 and the bear mocked him both roaring louder than
 the sea or weather

 sights the men are not yet cold under water nor

 enter time the chorus
time i that please some try all both joy and terror
 of good and bad that makes and unfolds error
 now take upon me in the name of time
 to use my wings impute it not a crime
 to me or my swift passage that i slide
 o'er sixteen years and leave the growth untried
 of that wide gap since it is in my power
 to o'erthrow law and in one selfborn hour
 to plant and o'erwhelm custom let me pass
 the same i am ere ancient'st order was
 or what is now received i witness to
 the times that brought them in so shall i do
 to the freshest things now reigning and make stale
 the glistering of this present as my tale
 now seems to it your patience this allowing
 i turn my glass and give my scene such growing
 as you had slept between leontes leaving
 the effects of his fond jealousies so grieving
 that he shuts up himself imagine me
 gentle spectators that i now may be
 in fair bohemia and remember well
 i mentioned a son o the king's which florizel
 i now name to you and with speed so pace
 to speak of perdita now grown in grace
 equal with wondering what of her ensues
 i list not prophecy but let time's news
 be known when tis brought forth
 a shepherd's daughter
 and what to her adheres which follows after
 is the argument of time of this allow
 if ever you have spent time worse ere now
 if never yet that time himself doth say
 he wishes earnestly you never may

scene ii bohemia the palace of polixenes
 enter polixenes and camillo
polixenes i pray thee good camillo be no more importunate
 tis a sickness denying thee any thing a death to
 grant this
camillo it is fifteen years since i saw my country though
 i have for the most part been aired abroad i
 desire to lay my bones there besides the penitent
 king my master hath sent for me to whose feeling
 sorrows i might be some allay or i o'erween to
 think so which is another spur to my departure
polixenes as thou lovest me camillo wipe not out the rest of
 thy services by leaving me now the need i have of
 thee thine own goodness hath made better not to
 have had thee than thus to want thee thou having
 made me businesses which none without thee can
 sufficiently manage must either stay to execute
 them thyself or take away with thee the very
 services thou hast done which if i have not enough
 considered as too much i cannot to be more
 thankful to thee shall be my study and my profit
 therein the heaping friendships of that fatal
 country sicilia prithee speak no more whose very
 naming punishes me with the remembrance of that
 penitent as thou callest him and reconciled king
 my brother whose loss of his most precious queen
 and children are even now to be afresh lamented
 say to me when sawest thou the prince florizel my
 son kings are no less unhappy their issue not
 being gracious than they are in losing them when
 they have approved their virtues
camillo sir it is three days since i saw the prince what
 his happier affairs may be are to me unknown but i
 have missingly noted he is of late much retired
 from court and is less frequent to his princely
 exercises than formerly he hath appeared
polixenes i have considered so much camillo and with some
 care so far that i have eyes under my service which
 look upon his removedness from whom i have this
 intelligence that he is seldom from the house of a
 most homely shepherd a man they say that from
 very nothing and beyond the imagination of his
 neighbours is grown into an unspeakable estate
camillo i have heard sir of such a man who hath a
 daughter of most rare note the report of her is
 extended more than can be thought to begin from such a cottage
polixenes that's likewise part of my intelligence but i
 fear the angle that plucks our son thither thou
 shalt accompany us to the place where we will not
 appearing what we are have some question with the
 shepherd from whose simplicity i think it not
 uneasy to get the cause of my son's resort thither
 prithee be my present partner in this business and
 lay aside the thoughts of sicilia
camillo i willingly obey your command
polixenes my best camillo we must disguise ourselves
