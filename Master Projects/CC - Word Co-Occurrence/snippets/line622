 a man doth of a death'shead or a memento mori i
 never see thy face but i think upon hellfire and
 dives that lived in purple for there he is in his
 robes burning burning if thou wert any way
 given to virtue i would swear by thy face my oath
 should be by this fire that's god's angel but
 thou art altogether given over and wert indeed but
 for the light in thy face the son of utter
 darkness when thou rannest up gadshill in the
 night to catch my horse if i did not think thou
 hadst been an ignis fatuus or a ball of wildfire

 perpetual triumph an everlasting bonfirelight
 thou hast saved me a thousand marks in links and
 torches walking with thee in the night betwixt
 tavern and tavern but the sack that thou hast
 drunk me would have bought me lights as good cheap
