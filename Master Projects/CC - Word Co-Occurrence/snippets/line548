 to be the lord on't no more yet of this
 for tis a chronicle of day by day
 not a relation for a breakfast nor
 befitting this first meeting welcome sir
 this cell's my court here have i few attendants
 and subjects none abroad pray you look in
 my dukedom since you have given me again
 i will requite you with as good a thing
 at least bring forth a wonder to content ye
 as much as me my dukedom
 here prospero discovers ferdinand and miranda
 playing at chess
miranda sweet lord you play me false
ferdinand no my dear'st love
 i would not for the world
miranda yes for a score of kingdoms you should wrangle
 and i would call it fair play
alonso if this prove
 a vision of the island one dear son
 shall i twice lose
sebastian a most high miracle
ferdinand though the seas threaten they are merciful
 i have cursed them without cause
 kneels
alonso now all the blessings
 of a glad father compass thee about
 arise and say how thou camest here
miranda o wonder
 how many goodly creatures are there here
 how beauteous mankind is o brave new world
 that has such people in't
prospero tis new to thee
alonso what is this maid with whom thou wast at play
 your eld'st acquaintance cannot be three hours
 is she the goddess that hath sever'd us
 and brought us thus together
ferdinand sir she is mortal
 but by immortal providence she's mine
 i chose her when i could not ask my father
 for his advice nor thought i had one she
 is daughter to this famous duke of milan
 of whom so often i have heard renown
 but never saw before of whom i have
 received a second life and second father
 this lady makes him to me
alonso i am hers
 but o how oddly will it sound that i
 must ask my child forgiveness
prospero there sir stop
 let us not burthen our remembrance with
 a heaviness that's gone
gonzalo i have inly wept
 or should have spoke ere this look down you god
 and on this couple drop a blessed crown
 for it is you that have chalk'd forth the way
 which brought us hither
alonso i say amen gonzalo
gonzalo was milan thrust from milan that his issue
 should become kings of naples o rejoice
 beyond a common joy and set it down
 with gold on lasting pillars in one voyage
 did claribel her husband find at tunis
 and ferdinand her brother found a wife
 where he himself was lost prospero his dukedom
 in a poor isle and all of us ourselves
 when no man was his own
alonso to ferdinand and miranda give me your hands
 let grief and sorrow still embrace his heart
 that doth not wish you joy
gonzalo be it so amen
 reenter ariel with the master and boatswain
 amazedly following
 o look sir look sir here is more of us
 i prophesied if a gallows were on land
 this fellow could not drown now blasphemy
 that swear'st grace o'erboard not an oath on shore
 hast thou no mouth by land what is the news
boatswain the best news is that we have safely found
 our king and company the next our ship
 which but three glasses since we gave out split
 is tight and yare and bravely rigg'd as when
 we first put out to sea
ariel aside to prospero sir all this service
 have i done since i went
prospero aside to ariel my tricksy spirit
alonso these are not natural events they strengthen
 from strange to stranger say how came you hither
boatswain if i did think sir i were well awake
 i'ld strive to tell you we were dead of sleep
 andhow we know notall clapp'd under hatches
 where but even now with strange and several noises
 of roaring shrieking howling jingling chains
 and more diversity of sounds all horrible
 we were awaked straightway at liberty
 where we in all her trim freshly beheld
 our royal good and gallant ship our master
 capering to eye her on a trice so please you
 even in a dream were we divided from them
 and were brought moping hither
ariel aside to prospero was't well done
prospero aside to ariel bravely my diligence thou shalt be free
alonso this is as strange a maze as e'er men trod
 and there is in this business more than nature
 was ever conduct of some oracle
 must rectify our knowledge
prospero sir my liege
 do not infest your mind with beating on
 the strangeness of this business at pick'd leisure
 which shall be shortly single i'll resolve you
 which to you shall seem probable of every
 these happen'd accidents till when be cheerful
 and think of each thing well
 aside to ariel
 come hither spirit
 set caliban and his companions free
 untie the spell
 exit ariel
 how fares my gracious sir
 there are yet missing of your company
 some few odd lads that you remember not
 reenter ariel driving in caliban stephano
 and trinculo in their stolen apparel
stephano every man shift for all the rest and
 let no man take care for himself for all is
 but fortune coragio bullymonster coragio
trinculo if these be true spies which i wear in my head
 here's a goodly sight
caliban o setebos these be brave spirits indeed
 how fine my master is i am afraid
 he will chastise me
sebastian ha ha
 what things are these my lord antonio
 will money buy em
antonio very like one of them
 is a plain fish and no doubt marketable
prospero mark but the badges of these men my lords
 then say if they be true this misshapen knave
 his mother was a witch and one so strong
 that could control the moon make flows and ebbs
 and deal in her command without her power
 these three have robb'd me and this demidevil
 for he's a bastard onehad plotted with them
 to take my life two of these fellows you
 must know and own this thing of darkness
 acknowledge mine
caliban i shall be pinch'd to death
alonso is not this stephano my drunken butler
sebastian he is drunk now where had he wine
alonso and trinculo is reeling ripe where should they
 find this grand liquor that hath gilded em
 how camest thou in this pickle
trinculo i have been in such a pickle since i
 saw you last that i fear me will never out of
 my bones i shall not fear flyblowing
sebastian why how now stephano
stephano o touch me not i am not stephano but a cramp
prospero you'ld be king o the isle sirrah
stephano i should have been a sore one then
alonso this is a strange thing as e'er i look'd on
 pointing to caliban
prospero he is as disproportion'd in his manners
 as in his shape go sirrah to my cell
 take with you your companions as you look
 to have my pardon trim it handsomely
caliban ay that i will and i'll be wise hereafter
 and seek for grace what a thricedouble ass
 was i to take this drunkard for a god
 and worship this dull fool
prospero go to away
alonso hence and bestow your luggage where you found it
sebastian or stole it rather
 exeunt caliban stephano and trinculo
prospero sir i invite your highness and your train
 to my poor cell where you shall take your rest
 for this one night which part of it i'll waste
 with such discourse as i not doubt shall make it
 go quick away the story of my life
 and the particular accidents gone by
 since i came to this isle and in the morn
 i'll bring you to your ship and so to naples
 where i have hope to see the nuptial
 of these our dearbeloved solemnized
 and thence retire me to my milan where
 every third thought shall be my grave
alonso i long
 to hear the story of your life which must
 take the ear strangely
prospero i'll deliver all
 and promise you calm seas auspicious gales
 and sail so expeditious that shall catch
 your royal fleet far off
 aside to ariel
 my ariel chick
 that is thy charge then to the elements
 be free and fare thou well please you draw near
 exeunt
 the tempest
 epilogue
 spoken by prospero
 now my charms are all o'erthrown
