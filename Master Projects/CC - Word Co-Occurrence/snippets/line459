 who chooseth me must give and hazard all he hath'
 how shall i know if i do choose the right
portia the one of them contains my picture prince
 if you choose that then i am yours withal
morocco some god direct my judgment let me see
 i will survey the inscriptions back again
 what says this leaden casket
 who chooseth me must give and hazard all he hath'
 must give for what for lead hazard for lead
 this casket threatens men that hazard all
 do it in hope of fair advantages
 a golden mind stoops not to shows of dross
 i'll then nor give nor hazard aught for lead
 what says the silver with her virgin hue
 who chooseth me shall get as much as he deserves'
 as much as he deserves pause there morocco
 and weigh thy value with an even hand
 if thou be'st rated by thy estimation
 thou dost deserve enough and yet enough
 may not extend so far as to the lady
 and yet to be afeard of my deserving
 were but a weak disabling of myself
 as much as i deserve why that's the lady
 i do in birth deserve her and in fortunes
 in graces and in qualities of breeding
 but more than these in love i do deserve
 what if i stray'd no further but chose here
 let's see once more this saying graved in gold
 who chooseth me shall gain what many men desire'
 why that's the lady all the world desires her
 from the four corners of the earth they come
 to kiss this shrine this mortalbreathing saint
 the hyrcanian deserts and the vasty wilds
 of wide arabia are as thoroughfares now
 for princes to come view fair portia
 the watery kingdom whose ambitious head
 spits in the face of heaven is no bar
 to stop the foreign spirits but they come
 as o'er a brook to see fair portia
 one of these three contains her heavenly picture
 is't like that lead contains her twere damnation
 to think so base a thought it were too gross
 to rib her cerecloth in the obscure grave
 or shall i think in silver she's immured
 being ten times undervalued to tried gold
 o sinful thought never so rich a gem
 was set in worse than gold they have in england
 a coin that bears the figure of an angel
 stamped in gold but that's insculp'd upon
 but here an angel in a golden bed
 lies all within deliver me the key
 here do i choose and thrive i as i may
portia there take it prince and if my form lie there
 then i am yours
 he unlocks the golden casket
morocco o hell what have we here
 a carrion death within whose empty eye
 there is a written scroll i'll read the writing
 reads
 all that glitters is not gold
 often have you heard that told
 many a man his life hath sold
 but my outside to behold
 gilded tombs do worms enfold
 had you been as wise as bold
 young in limbs in judgment old
 your answer had not been inscroll'd
 fare you well your suit is cold
 cold indeed and labour lost
 then farewell heat and welcome frost
 portia adieu i have too grieved a heart
 to take a tedious leave thus losers part
 exit with his train flourish of cornets
portia a gentle riddance draw the curtains go
 let all of his complexion choose me so

scene viii venice a street
 enter salarino and salanio
salarino why man i saw bassanio under sail
 with him is gratiano gone along
 and in their ship i am sure lorenzo is not
salanio the villain jew with outcries raised the duke
 who went with him to search bassanio's ship
salarino he came too late the ship was under sail
 but there the duke was given to understand
 that in a gondola were seen together
 lorenzo and his amorous jessica
 besides antonio certified the duke
 they were not with bassanio in his ship
salanio i never heard a passion so confused
 so strange outrageous and so variable
 as the dog jew did utter in the streets
 my daughter o my ducats o my daughter
 fled with a christian o my christian ducats
 justice the law my ducats and my daughter
 a sealed bag two sealed bags of ducats
 of double ducats stolen from me by my daughter
 and jewels two stones two rich and precious stones
 stolen by my daughter justice find the girl
 she hath the stones upon her and the ducats'
salarino why all the boys in venice follow him
 crying his stones his daughter and his ducats
salanio let good antonio look he keep his day
 or he shall pay for this
salarino marry well remember'd
 i reason'd with a frenchman yesterday
 who told me in the narrow seas that part
 the french and english there miscarried
 a vessel of our country richly fraught
 i thought upon antonio when he told me
 and wish'd in silence that it were not his
salanio you were best to tell antonio what you hear
 yet do not suddenly for it may grieve him
salarino a kinder gentleman treads not the earth
 i saw bassanio and antonio part
 bassanio told him he would make some speed
 of his return he answer'd do not so
 slubber not business for my sake bassanio
 but stay the very riping of the time
 and for the jew's bond which he hath of me
 let it not enter in your mind of love
 be merry and employ your chiefest thoughts
 to courtship and such fair ostents of love
 as shall conveniently become you there'
 and even there his eye being big with tears
 turning his face he put his hand behind him
 and with affection wondrous sensible
 he wrung bassanio's hand and so they parted
salanio i think he only loves the world for him
 i pray thee let us go and find him out
 and quicken his embraced heaviness
 with some delight or other
salarino do we so

act ii
scene ix belmont a room in portia's house
 enter nerissa with a servitor
nerissa quick quick i pray thee draw the curtain straight
 the prince of arragon hath ta'en his oath
 and comes to his election presently
 flourish of cornets enter the prince of arragon
 portia and their trains
portia behold there stand the caskets noble prince
 if you choose that wherein i am contain'd
 straight shall our nuptial rites be solemnized
 but if you fail without more speech my lord
 you must be gone from hence immediately
arragon i am enjoin'd by oath to observe three things
 first never to unfold to any one
 which casket twas i chose next if i fail
 of the right casket never in my life
 to woo a maid in way of marriage lastly
 if i do fail in fortune of my choice
 immediately to leave you and be gone
portia to these injunctions every one doth swear
 that comes to hazard for my worthless self
arragon and so have i address'd me fortune now
 to my heart's hope gold silver and base lead
 who chooseth me must give and hazard all he hath'
 you shall look fairer ere i give or hazard
 what says the golden chest ha let me see
 who chooseth me shall gain what many men desire'
 what many men desire that many may be meant
 by the fool multitude that choose by show
 not learning more than the fond eye doth teach
 which pries not to the interior but like the martlet
 builds in the weather on the outward wall
 even in the force and road of casualty
 i will not choose what many men desire
 because i will not jump with common spirits
 and rank me with the barbarous multitudes
 why then to thee thou silver treasurehouse
 tell me once more what title thou dost bear
 who chooseth me shall get as much as he deserves'
 and well said too for who shall go about
 to cozen fortune and be honourable
 without the stamp of merit let none presume
 to wear an undeserved dignity
 o that estates degrees and offices
 were not derived corruptly and that clear honour
 were purchased by the merit of the wearer
 how many then should cover that stand bare
 how many be commanded that command
 how much low peasantry would then be glean'd
 from the true seed of honour and how much honour
 pick'd from the chaff and ruin of the times
 to be newvarnish'd well but to my choice
 who chooseth me shall get as much as he deserves'
 i will assume desert give me a key for this
 and instantly unlock my fortunes here
 he opens the silver casket
portia too long a pause for that which you find there
arragon what's here the portrait of a blinking idiot
 presenting me a schedule i will read it
 how much unlike art thou to portia
 how much unlike my hopes and my deservings
 who chooseth me shall have as much as he deserves'
