 thou hast made me now a man never before
 this happy child did i get any thing
 this oracle of comfort has so pleased me
 that when i am in heaven i shall desire
 to see what this child does and praise my maker
 i thank ye all to you my good lord mayor
 and your good brethren i am much beholding
 i have received much honour by your presence
 and ye shall find me thankful lead the way lords
 ye must all see the queen and she must thank ye
 she will be sick else this day no man think
 has business at his house for all shall stay
 this little one shall make it holiday

 epilogue
 tis ten to one this play can never please
 all that are here some come to take their ease
 and sleep an act or two but those we fear
 we have frighted with our trumpets so tis clear
 they'll say tis naught others to hear the city
 abused extremely and to cry that's witty'
 which we have not done neither that i fear
 all the expected good we're like to hear
 for this play at this time is only in
 the merciful construction of good women
 for such a one we show'd em if they smile
 and say twill do i know within a while
 all the best men are ours for tis ill hap
 if they hold when their ladies bid em clap

 exeunt chatillon and pembroke
queen elinor what now my son have i not ever said
 how that ambitious constance would not cease
 till she had kindled france and all the world
 upon the right and party of her son
 this might have been prevented and made whole
 with very easy arguments of love
 which now the manage of two kingdoms must
 with fearful bloody issue arbitrate
king john our strong possession and our right for us
queen elinor your strong possession much more than your right
 or else it must go wrong with you and me
 so much my conscience whispers in your ear
 which none but heaven and you and i shall hear
 enter a sheriff
essex my liege here is the strangest controversy
 come from country to be judged by you
 that e'er i heard shall i produce the men
king john let them approach
 our abbeys and our priories shall pay
 this expedition's charge
 enter robert and the bastard
 what men are you
bastard your faithful subject i a gentleman
 born in northamptonshire and eldest son
 as i suppose to robert faulconbridge
 a soldier by the honourgiving hand
 of coeurdelion knighted in the field
king john what art thou
robert the son and heir to that same faulconbridge
king john is that the elder and art thou the heir
 you came not of one mother then it seems
bastard most certain of one mother mighty king
 that is well known and as i think one father
 but for the certain knowledge of that truth
 i put you o'er to heaven and to my mother
 of that i doubt as all men's children may
queen elinor out on thee rude man thou dost shame thy mother
 and wound her honour with this diffidence
bastard i madam no i have no reason for it
 that is my brother's plea and none of mine
 the which if he can prove a pops me out
 at least from fair five hundred pound a year
 heaven guard my mother's honour and my land
king john a good blunt fellow why being younger born
 doth he lay claim to thine inheritance
bastard i know not why except to get the land
 but once he slander'd me with bastardy
 but whether i be as true begot or no
 that still i lay upon my mother's head
 but that i am as well begot my liege
 fair fall the bones that took the pains for me
 compare our faces and be judge yourself
 if old sir robert did beget us both
 and were our father and this son like him
 o old sir robert father on my knee
 i give heaven thanks i was not like to thee
king john why what a madcap hath heaven lent us here
queen elinor he hath a trick of coeurdelion's face
 the accent of his tongue affecteth him
 do you not read some tokens of my son
 in the large composition of this man
king john mine eye hath well examined his parts
 and finds them perfect richard sirrah speak
 what doth move you to claim your brother's land
bastard because he hath a halfface like my father
 with half that face would he have all my land
 a halffaced groat five hundred pound a year
robert my gracious liege when that my father lived
 your brother did employ my father much
bastard well sir by this you cannot get my land
 your tale must be how he employ'd my mother
robert and once dispatch'd him in an embassy
 to germany there with the emperor
 to treat of high affairs touching that time
 the advantage of his absence took the king
 and in the mean time sojourn'd at my father's
 where how he did prevail i shame to speak
 but truth is truth large lengths of seas and shores
 between my father and my mother lay
 as i have heard my father speak himself
 when this same lusty gentleman was got
 upon his deathbed he by will bequeath'd
 his lands to me and took it on his death
 that this my mother's son was none of his
 and if he were he came into the world
 full fourteen weeks before the course of time
 then good my liege let me have what is mine
 my father's land as was my father's will
king john sirrah your brother is legitimate
 your father's wife did after wedlock bear him
 and if she did play false the fault was hers
 which fault lies on the hazards of all husbands
 that marry wives tell me how if my brother
 who as you say took pains to get this son
 had of your father claim'd this son for his
 in sooth good friend your father might have kept
 this calf bred from his cow from all the world
 in sooth he might then if he were my brother's
