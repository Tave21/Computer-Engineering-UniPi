 your most obedient counsellor yet that dare
 less appear so in comforting your evils
 than such as most seem yours i say i come
 from your good queen
leontes good queen
paulina good queen my lord
 good queen i say good queen
 and would by combat make her good so were i
 a man the worst about you
leontes force her hence
paulina let him that makes but trifles of his eyes
 first hand me on mine own accord i'll off
 but first i'll do my errand the good queen
 for she is good hath brought you forth a daughter
 here tis commends it to your blessing
 laying down the child
leontes out
 a mankind witch hence with her out o door
 a most intelligencing bawd
paulina not so
 i am as ignorant in that as you
 in so entitling me and no less honest
 than you are mad which is enough i'll warrant
 as this world goes to pass for honest
leontes traitors
 will you not push her out give her the bastard
 thou dotard thou art womantired unroosted
 by thy dame partlet here take up the bastard
 take't up i say give't to thy crone
paulina for ever
 unvenerable be thy hands if thou
 takest up the princess by that forced baseness
 which he has put upon't
leontes he dreads his wife
paulina so i would you did then twere past all doubt
 you'ld call your children yours
leontes a nest of traitors
antigonus i am none by this good light
paulina nor i nor any
 but one that's here and that's himself for he
 the sacred honour of himself his queen's
 his hopeful son's his babe's betrays to slander
 whose sting is sharper than the sword's
 and will not
 for as the case now stands it is a curse
 he cannot be compell'd to'tonce remove
 the root of his opinion which is rotten
 as ever oak or stone was sound
leontes a callat
 of boundless tongue who late hath beat her husband
 and now baits me this brat is none of mine
 it is the issue of polixenes
 hence with it and together with the dam
 commit them to the fire
paulina it is yours
 and might we lay the old proverb to your charge
 so like you tis the worse behold my lords
 although the print be little the whole matter
 and copy of the father eye nose lip
 the trick of's frown his forehead nay the valley
 the pretty dimples of his chin and cheek
 his smiles
 the very mould and frame of hand nail finger
 and thou good goddess nature which hast made it
 so like to him that got it if thou hast
 the ordering of the mind too mongst all colours
 no yellow in't lest she suspect as he does
 her children not her husband's
leontes a gross hag
 and lozel thou art worthy to be hang'd
 that wilt not stay her tongue
antigonus hang all the husbands
 that cannot do that feat you'll leave yourself
 hardly one subject
leontes once more take her hence
paulina a most unworthy and unnatural lord
 can do no more
leontes i'll ha thee burnt
paulina i care not
 it is an heretic that makes the fire
 not she which burns in't i'll not call you tyrant
 but this most cruel usage of your queen
 not able to produce more accusation
 than your own weakhinged fancy something savours
 of tyranny and will ignoble make you
 yea scandalous to the world
leontes on your allegiance
 out of the chamber with her were i a tyrant
 where were her life she durst not call me so
 if she did know me one away with her
paulina i pray you do not push me i'll be gone
 look to your babe my lord tis yours
 jove send her
 a better guiding spirit what needs these hands
 you that are thus so tender o'er his follies
 will never do him good not one of you
 so so farewell we are gone
 exit
leontes thou traitor hast set on thy wife to this
 my child away with't even thou that hast
 a heart so tender o'er it take it hence
 and see it instantly consumed with fire
 even thou and none but thou take it up straight
 within this hour bring me word tis done
 and by good testimony or i'll seize thy life
 with what thou else call'st thine if thou refuse
 and wilt encounter with my wrath say so
 the bastard brains with these my proper hands
 shall i dash out go take it to the fire
 for thou set'st on thy wife
antigonus i did not sir
 these lords my noble fellows if they please
 can clear me in't
lords we can my royal liege
 he is not guilty of her coming hither
leontes you're liars all
first lord beseech your highness give us better credit
 we have always truly served you and beseech you
 so to esteem of us and on our knees we beg
 as recompense of our dear services
 past and to come that you do change this purpose
 which being so horrible so bloody must
 lead on to some foul issue we all kneel
leontes i am a feather for each wind that blows
 shall i live on to see this bastard kneel
 and call me father better burn it now
 than curse it then but be it let it live
 it shall not neither you sir come you hither
 you that have been so tenderly officious
 with lady margery your midwife there
 to save this bastard's lifefor tis a bastard
 so sure as this beard's grey
 what will you adventure
 to save this brat's life
antigonus any thing my lord
 that my ability may undergo
 and nobleness impose at least thus much
 i'll pawn the little blood which i have left
 to save the innocent any thing possible
leontes it shall be possible swear by this sword
 thou wilt perform my bidding
antigonus i will my lord
leontes mark and perform it see'st thou for the fail
 of any point in't shall not only be
 death to thyself but to thy lewdtongued wife
 whom for this time we pardon we enjoin thee
 as thou art liegeman to us that thou carry
 this female bastard hence and that thou bear it
 to some remote and desert place quite out
 of our dominions and that there thou leave it
 without more mercy to its own protection
 and favour of the climate as by strange fortune
 it came to us i do in justice charge thee
 on thy soul's peril and thy body's torture
 that thou commend it strangely to some place
 where chance may nurse or end it take it up
antigonus i swear to do this though a present death
 had been more merciful come on poor babe
 some powerful spirit instruct the kites and ravens
 to be thy nurses wolves and bears they say
 casting their savageness aside have done
 like offices of pity sir be prosperous
 in more than this deed does require and blessing
 against this cruelty fight on thy side
 poor thing condemn'd to loss
 exit with the child
leontes no i'll not rear
 another's issue
 enter a servant
servant please your highness posts
 from those you sent to the oracle are come
 an hour since cleomenes and dion
 being well arrived from delphos are both landed
 hasting to the court
first lord so please you sir their speed
 hath been beyond account
leontes twentythree days
 they have been absent tis good speed foretells
 the great apollo suddenly will have
 the truth of this appear prepare you lords
 summon a session that we may arraign
 our most disloyal lady for as she hath
 been publicly accused so shall she have
 a just and open trial while she lives
 my heart will be a burthen to me leave me
 and think upon my bidding
 exeunt
 the winter's tale
act iii
scene i a seaport in sicilia
 enter cleomenes and dion
cleomenes the climate's delicate the air most sweet
 fertile the isle the temple much surpassing
 the common praise it bears
dion i shall report
 for most it caught me the celestial habits
 methinks i so should term them and the reverence
 of the grave wearers o the sacrifice
 how ceremonious solemn and unearthly
 it was i the offering
