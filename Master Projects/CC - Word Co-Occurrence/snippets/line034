and abimelech and the company that was with him rushed forward and stood in the entering of the gate of the city and the two other companies ran upon all the people that were in the fields and slew them
and abimelech fought against the city all that day and he took the city and slew the people that was therein and beat down the city and sowed it with salt
and when all the men of the tower of shechem heard that they entered into an hold of the house of the god berith
and it was told abimelech that all the men of the tower of shechem were gathered together
and abimelech gat him up to mount zalmon he and all the people that were with him and abimelech took an axe in his hand and cut down a bough from the trees and took it and laid it on his shoulder and said unto the people that were with him what ye have seen me do make haste and do as i have done
and all the people likewise cut down every man his bough and followed abimelech and put them to the hold and set the hold on fire upon them so that all the men of the tower of shechem died also about a thousand men and women
then went abimelech to thebez and encamped against thebez and took it
but there was a strong tower within the city and thither fled all the men and women and all they of the city and shut it to them and gat them up to the top of the tower
and abimelech came unto the tower and fought against it and went hard unto the door of the tower to burn it with fire
and a certain woman cast a piece of a millstone upon abimelech's head and all to brake his skull
then he called hastily unto the young man his armourbearer and said unto him draw thy sword and slay me that men say not of me a woman slew him and his young man thrust him through and he died
and when the men of israel saw that abimelech was dead they departed every man unto his place
thus god rendered the wickedness of abimelech which he did unto his father in slaying his seventy brethren
and all the evil of the men of shechem did god render upon their heads and upon them came the curse of jotham the son of jerubbaal
and after abimelech there arose to defend israel tola the son of puah the son of dodo a man of issachar and he dwelt in shamir in mount ephraim
and he judged israel twenty and three years and died and was buried in shamir
and after him arose jair a gileadite and judged israel twenty and two years
and he had thirty sons that rode on thirty ass colts and they had thirty cities which are called havothjair unto this day which are in the land of gilead
and jair died and was buried in camon
and the children of israel did evil again in the sight of the lord and served baalim and ashtaroth and the gods of syria and the gods of zidon and the gods of moab and the gods of the children of ammon and the gods of the philistines and forsook the lord and served not him
and the anger of the lord was hot against israel and he sold them into the hands of the philistines and into the hands of the children of ammon
and that year they vexed and oppressed the children of israel eighteen years all the children of israel that were on the other side jordan in the land of the amorites which is in gilead
moreover the children of ammon passed over jordan to fight also against judah and against benjamin and against the house of ephraim so that israel was sore distressed
and the children of israel cried unto the lord saying we have sinned against thee both because we have forsaken our god and also served baalim
and the lord said unto the children of israel did not i deliver you from the egyptians and from the amorites from the children of ammon and from the philistines
the zidonians also and the amalekites and the maonites did oppress you and ye cried to me and i delivered you out of their hand
yet ye have forsaken me and served other gods wherefore i will deliver you no more
go and cry unto the gods which ye have chosen let them deliver you in the time of your tribulation
and the children of israel said unto the lord we have sinned do thou unto us whatsoever seemeth good unto thee deliver us only we pray thee this day
and they put away the strange gods from among them and served the lord and his soul was grieved for the misery of israel
then the children of ammon were gathered together and encamped in gilead and the children of israel assembled themselves together and encamped in mizpeh
and the people and princes of gilead said one to another what man is he that will begin to fight against the children of ammon he shall be head over all the inhabitants of gilead
now jephthah the gileadite was a mighty man of valour and he was the son of an harlot and gilead begat jephthah
and gilead's wife bare him sons and his wife's sons grew up and they thrust out jephthah and said unto him thou shalt not inherit in our father's house for thou art the son of a strange woman
then jephthah fled from his brethren and dwelt in the land of tob and there were gathered vain men to jephthah and went out with him
and it came to pass in process of time that the children of ammon made war against israel
and it was so that when the children of ammon made war against israel the elders of gilead went to fetch jephthah out of the land of tob
and they said unto jephthah come and be our captain that we may fight with the children of ammon
and jephthah said unto the elders of gilead did not ye hate me and expel me out of my father's house and why are ye come unto me now when ye are in distress
and the elders of gilead said unto jephthah therefore we turn again to thee now that thou mayest go with us and fight against the children of ammon and be our head over all the inhabitants of gilead
and jephthah said unto the elders of gilead if ye bring me home again to fight against the children of ammon and the lord deliver them before me shall i be your head
and the elders of gilead said unto jephthah the lord be witness between us if we do not so according to thy words
then jephthah went with the elders of gilead and the people made him head and captain over them and jephthah uttered all his words before the lord in mizpeh
and jephthah sent messengers unto the king of the children of ammon saying what hast thou to do with me that thou art come against me to fight in my land
and the king of the children of ammon answered unto the messengers of jephthah because israel took away my land when they came up out of egypt from arnon even unto jabbok and unto jordan now therefore restore those lands again peaceably
and jephthah sent messengers again unto the king of the children of ammon
and said unto him thus saith jephthah israel took not away the land of moab nor the land of the children of ammon
but when israel came up from egypt and walked through the wilderness unto the red sea and came to kadesh
then israel sent messengers unto the king of edom saying let me i pray thee pass through thy land but the king of edom would not hearken thereto and in like manner they sent unto the king of moab but he would not consent and israel abode in kadesh
then they went along through the wilderness and compassed the land of edom and the land of moab and came by the east side of the land of moab and pitched on the other side of arnon but came not within the border of moab for arnon was the border of moab
and israel sent messengers unto sihon king of the amorites the king of heshbon and israel said unto him let us pass we pray thee through thy land into my place
but sihon trusted not israel to pass through his coast but sihon gathered all his people together and pitched in jahaz and fought against israel
and the lord god of israel delivered sihon and all his people into the hand of israel and they smote them so israel possessed all the land of the amorites the inhabitants of that country
and they possessed all the coasts of the amorites from arnon even unto jabbok and from the wilderness even unto jordan
so now the lord god of israel hath dispossessed the amorites from before his people israel and shouldest thou possess it
wilt not thou possess that which chemosh thy god giveth thee to possess so whomsoever the lord our god shall drive out from before us them will we possess
and now art thou any thing better than balak the son of zippor king of moab did he ever strive against israel or did he ever fight against them
while israel dwelt in heshbon and her towns and in aroer and her towns and in all the cities that be along by the coasts of arnon three hundred years why therefore did ye not recover them within that time
wherefore i have not sinned against thee but thou doest me wrong to war against me the lord the judge be judge this day between the children of israel and the children of ammon
howbeit the king of the children of ammon hearkened not unto the words of jephthah which he sent him
then the spirit of the lord came upon jephthah and he passed over gilead and manasseh and passed over mizpeh of gilead and from mizpeh of gilead he passed over unto the children of ammon
and jephthah vowed a vow unto the lord and said if thou shalt without fail deliver the children of ammon into mine hands
then it shall be that whatsoever cometh forth of the doors of my house to meet me when i return in peace from the children of ammon shall surely be the lord's and i will offer it up for a burnt offering
so jephthah passed over unto the children of ammon to fight against them and the lord delivered them into his hands
and he smote them from aroer even till thou come to minnith even twenty cities and unto the plain of the vineyards with a very great slaughter thus the children of ammon were subdued before the children of israel
and jephthah came to mizpeh unto his house and behold his daughter came out to meet him with timbrels and with dances and she was his only child beside her he had neither son nor daughter
and it came to pass when he saw her that he rent his clothes and said alas my daughter thou hast brought me very low and thou art one of them that trouble me for i have opened my mouth unto the lord and i cannot go back
and she said unto him my father if thou hast opened thy mouth unto the lord do to me according to that which hath proceeded out of thy mouth forasmuch as the lord hath taken vengeance for thee of thine enemies even of the children of ammon
and she said unto her father let this thing be done for me let me alone two months that i may go up and down upon the mountains and bewail my virginity i and my fellows
and he said go and he sent her away for two months and she went with her companions and bewailed her virginity upon the mountains
and it came to pass at the end of two months that she returned unto her father who did with her according to his vow which he had vowed and she knew no man and it was a custom in israel
that the daughters of israel went yearly to lament the daughter of jephthah the gileadite four days in a year
and the men of ephraim gathered themselves together and went northward and said unto jephthah wherefore passedst thou over to fight against the children of ammon and didst not call us to go with thee we will burn thine house upon thee with fire
and jephthah said unto them i and my people were at great strife with the children of ammon and when i called you ye delivered me not out of their hands
and when i saw that ye delivered me not i put my life in my hands and passed over against the children of ammon and the lord delivered them into my hand wherefore then are ye come up unto me this day to fight against me
then jephthah gathered together all the men of gilead and fought with ephraim and the men of gilead smote ephraim because they said ye gileadites are fugitives of ephraim among the ephraimites and among the manassites
and the gileadites took the passages of jordan before the ephraimites and it was so that when those ephraimites which were escaped said let me go over that the men of gilead said unto him art thou an ephraimite if he said nay
then said they unto him say now shibboleth and he said sibboleth for he could not frame to pronounce it right then they took him and slew him at the passages of jordan and there fell at that time of the ephraimites forty and two thousand
and jephthah judged israel six years then died jephthah the gileadite and was buried in one of the cities of gilead
and after him ibzan of bethlehem judged israel
and he had thirty sons and thirty daughters whom he sent abroad and took in thirty daughters from abroad for his sons and he judged israel seven years
then died ibzan and was buried at bethlehem
and after him elon a zebulonite judged israel and he judged israel ten years
and elon the zebulonite died and was buried in aijalon in the country of zebulun
and after him abdon the son of hillel a pirathonite judged israel
and he had forty sons and thirty nephews that rode on threescore and ten ass colts and he judged israel eight years
and abdon the son of hillel the pirathonite died and was buried in pirathon in the land of ephraim in the mount of the amalekites
and the children of israel did evil again in the sight of the lord and the lord delivered them into the hand of the philistines forty years
and there was a certain man of zorah of the family of the danites whose name was manoah and his wife was barren and bare not
and the angel of the lord appeared unto the woman and said unto her behold now thou art barren and bearest not but thou shalt conceive and bear a son
now therefore beware i pray thee and drink not wine nor strong drink and eat not any unclean thing
for lo thou shalt conceive and bear a son and no razor shall come on his head for the child shall be a nazarite unto god from the womb and he shall begin to deliver israel out of the hand of the philistines
then the woman came and told her husband saying a man of god came unto me and his countenance was like the countenance of an angel of god very terrible but i asked him not whence he was neither told he me his name
but he said unto me behold thou shalt conceive and bear a son and now drink no wine nor strong drink neither eat any unclean thing for the child shall be a nazarite to god from the womb to the day of his death
then manoah intreated the lord and said o my lord let the man of god which thou didst send come again unto us and teach us what we shall do unto the child that shall be born
and god hearkened to the voice of manoah and the angel of god came again unto the woman as she sat in the field but manoah her husband was not with her
and the woman made haste and ran and shewed her husband and said unto him behold the man hath appeared unto me that came unto me the other day
and manoah arose and went after his wife and came to the man and said unto him art thou the man that spakest unto the woman and he said i am
and manoah said now let thy words come to pass how shall we order the child and how shall we do unto him
and the angel of the lord said unto manoah of all that i said unto the woman let her beware
she may not eat of any thing that cometh of the vine neither let her drink wine or strong drink nor eat any unclean thing all that i commanded her let her observe
and manoah said unto the angel of the lord i pray thee let us detain thee until we shall have made ready a kid for thee
and the angel of the lord said unto manoah though thou detain me i will not eat of thy bread and if thou wilt offer a burnt offering thou must offer it unto the lord for manoah knew not that he was an angel of the lord
and manoah said unto the angel of the lord what is thy name that when thy sayings come to pass we may do thee honour
and the angel of the lord said unto him why askest thou thus after my name seeing it is secret
so manoah took a kid with a meat offering and offered it upon a rock unto the lord and the angel did wonderously and manoah and his wife looked on
for it came to pass when the flame went up toward heaven from off the altar that the angel of the lord ascended in the flame of the altar and manoah and his wife looked on it and fell on their faces to the ground
but the angel of the lord did no more appear to manoah and to his wife then manoah knew that he was an angel of the lord
and manoah said unto his wife we shall surely die because we have seen god
but his wife said unto him if the lord were pleased to kill us he would not have received a burnt offering and a meat offering at our hands neither would he have shewed us all these things nor would as at this time have told us such things as these
and the woman bare a son and called his name samson and the child grew and the lord blessed him
and the spirit of the lord began to move him at times in the camp of dan between zorah and eshtaol
and samson went down to timnath and saw a woman in timnath of the daughters of the philistines
and he came up and told his father and his mother and said i have seen a woman in timnath of the daughters of the philistines now therefore get her for me to wife
then his father and his mother said unto him is there never a woman among the daughters of thy brethren or among all my people that thou goest to take a wife of the uncircumcised philistines and samson said unto his father get her for me for she pleaseth me well
but his father and his mother knew not that it was of the lord that he sought an occasion against the philistines for at that time the philistines had dominion over israel
then went samson down and his father and his mother to timnath and came to the vineyards of timnath and behold a young lion roared against him
and the spirit of the lord came mightily upon him and he rent him as he would have rent a kid and he had nothing in his hand but he told not his father or his mother what he had done
and he went down and talked with the woman and she pleased samson well
and after a time he returned to take her and he turned aside to see the carcase of the lion and behold there was a swarm of bees and honey in the carcase of the lion
and he took thereof in his hands and went on eating and came to his father and mother and he gave them and they did eat but he told not them that he had taken the honey out of the carcase of the lion
so his father went down unto the woman and samson made there a feast for so used the young men to do
and it came to pass when they saw him that they brought thirty companions to be with him
and samson said unto them i will now put forth a riddle unto you if ye can certainly declare it me within the seven days of the feast and find it out then i will give you thirty sheets and thirty change of garments
but if ye cannot declare it me then shall ye give me thirty sheets and thirty change of garments and they said unto him put forth thy riddle that we may hear it
and he said unto them out of the eater came forth meat and out of the strong came forth sweetness and they could not in three days expound the riddle
and it came to pass on the seventh day that they said unto samson's wife entice thy husband that he may declare unto us the riddle lest we burn thee and thy father's house with fire have ye called us to take that we have is it not so
and samson's wife wept before him and said thou dost but hate me and lovest me not thou hast put forth a riddle unto the children of my people and hast not told it me and he said unto her behold i have not told it my father nor my mother and shall i tell it thee
and she wept before him the seven days while their feast lasted and it came to pass on the seventh day that he told her because she lay sore upon him and she told the riddle to the children of her people
and the men of the city said unto him on the seventh day before the sun went down what is sweeter than honey and what is stronger than a lion and he said unto them if ye had not plowed with my heifer ye had not found out my riddle
and the spirit of the lord came upon him and he went down to ashkelon and slew thirty men of them and took their spoil and gave change of garments unto them which expounded the riddle and his anger was kindled and he went up to his father's house
but samson's wife was given to his companion whom he had used as his friend
but it came to pass within a while after in the time of wheat harvest that samson visited his wife with a kid and he said i will go in to my wife into the chamber but her father would not suffer him to go in
and her father said i verily thought that thou hadst utterly hated her therefore i gave her to thy companion is not her younger sister fairer than she take her i pray thee instead of her
and samson said concerning them now shall i be more blameless than the philistines though i do them a displeasure
and samson went and caught three hundred foxes and took firebrands and turned tail to tail and put a firebrand in the midst between two tails
and when he had set the brands on fire he let them go into the standing corn of the philistines and burnt up both the shocks and also the standing corn with the vineyards and olives
then the philistines said who hath done this and they answered samson the son in law of the timnite because he had taken his wife and given her to his companion and the philistines came up and burnt her and her father with fire
and samson said unto them though ye have done this yet will i be avenged of you and after that i will cease
and he smote them hip and thigh with a great slaughter and he went down and dwelt in the top of the rock etam
then the philistines went up and pitched in judah and spread themselves in lehi
and the men of judah said why are ye come up against us and they answered to bind samson are we come up to do to him as he hath done to us
then three thousand men of judah went to the top of the rock etam and said to samson knowest thou not that the philistines are rulers over us what is this that thou hast done unto us and he said unto them as they did unto me so have i done unto them
and they said unto him we are come down to bind thee that we may deliver thee into the hand of the philistines and samson said unto them swear unto me that ye will not fall upon me yourselves
and they spake unto him saying no but we will bind thee fast and deliver thee into their hand but surely we will not kill thee and they bound him with two new cords and brought him up from the rock
and when he came unto lehi the philistines shouted against him and the spirit of the lord came mightily upon him and the cords that were upon his arms became as flax that was burnt with fire and his bands loosed from off his hands
and he found a new jawbone of an ass and put forth his hand and took it and slew a thousand men therewith
and samson said with the jawbone of an ass heaps upon heaps with the jaw of an ass have i slain a thousand men
and it came to pass when he had made an end of speaking that he cast away the jawbone out of his hand and called that place ramathlehi
and he was sore athirst and called on the lord and said thou hast given this great deliverance into the hand of thy servant and now shall i die for thirst and fall into the hand of the uncircumcised
but god clave an hollow place that was in the jaw and there came water thereout and when he had drunk his spirit came again and he revived wherefore he called the name thereof enhakkore which is in lehi unto this day
and he judged israel in the days of the philistines twenty years
then went samson to gaza and saw there an harlot and went in unto her
and it was told the gazites saying samson is come hither and they compassed him in and laid wait for him all night in the gate of the city and were quiet all the night saying in the morning when it is day we shall kill him
and samson lay till midnight and arose at midnight and took the doors of the gate of the city and the two posts and went away with them bar and all and put them upon his shoulders and carried them up to the top of an hill that is before hebron
and it came to pass afterward that he loved a woman in the valley of sorek whose name was delilah
and the lords of the philistines came up unto her and said unto her entice him and see wherein his great strength lieth and by what means we may prevail against him that we may bind him to afflict him and we will give thee every one of us eleven hundred pieces of silver
and delilah said to samson tell me i pray thee wherein thy great strength lieth and wherewith thou mightest be bound to afflict thee
and samson said unto her if they bind me with seven green withs that were never dried then shall i be weak and be as another man
then the lords of the philistines brought up to her seven green withs which had not been dried and she bound him with them
now there were men lying in wait abiding with her in the chamber and she said unto him the philistines be upon thee samson and he brake the withs as a thread of tow is broken when it toucheth the fire so his strength was not known
and delilah said unto samson behold thou hast mocked me and told me lies now tell me i pray thee wherewith thou mightest be bound
and he said unto her if they bind me fast with new ropes that never were occupied then shall i be weak and be as another man
delilah therefore took new ropes and bound him therewith and said unto him the philistines be upon thee samson and there were liers in wait abiding in the chamber and he brake them from off his arms like a thread
and delilah said unto samson hitherto thou hast mocked me and told me lies tell me wherewith thou mightest be bound and he said unto her if thou weavest the seven locks of my head with the web
and she fastened it with the pin and said unto him the philistines be upon thee samson and he awaked out of his sleep and went away with the pin of the beam and with the web
and she said unto him how canst thou say i love thee when thine heart is not with me thou hast mocked me these three times and hast not told me wherein thy great strength lieth
and it came to pass when she pressed him daily with her words and urged him so that his soul was vexed unto death
that he told her all his heart and said unto her there hath not come a razor upon mine head for i have been a nazarite unto god from my mother's womb if i be shaven then my strength will go from me and i shall become weak and be like any other man
and when delilah saw that he had told her all his heart she sent and called for the lords of the philistines saying come up this once for he hath shewed me all his heart then the lords of the philistines came up unto her and brought money in their hand
and she made him sleep upon her knees and she called for a man and she caused him to shave off the seven locks of his head and she began to afflict him and his strength went from him
and she said the philistines be upon thee samson and he awoke out of his sleep and said i will go out as at other times before and shake myself and he wist not that the lord was departed from him
but the philistines took him and put out his eyes and brought him down to gaza and bound him with fetters of brass and he did grind in the prison house
howbeit the hair of his head began to grow again after he was shaven
then the lords of the philistines gathered them together for to offer a great sacrifice unto dagon their god and to rejoice for they said our god hath delivered samson our enemy into our hand
and when the people saw him they praised their god for they said our god hath delivered into our hands our enemy and the destroyer of our country which slew many of us
and it came to pass when their hearts were merry that they said call for samson that he may make us sport and they called for samson out of the prison house and he made them sport and they set him between the pillars
and samson said unto the lad that held him by the hand suffer me that i may feel the pillars whereupon the house standeth that i may lean upon them
now the house was full of men and women and all the lords of the philistines were there and there were upon the roof about three thousand men and women that beheld while samson made sport
and samson called unto the lord and said o lord god remember me i pray thee and strengthen me i pray thee only this once o god that i may be at once avenged of the philistines for my two eyes
and samson took hold of the two middle pillars upon which the house stood and on which it was borne up of the one with his right hand and of the other with his left
and samson said let me die with the philistines and he bowed himself with all his might and the house fell upon the lords and upon all the people that were therein so the dead which he slew at his death were more than they which he slew in his life
then his brethren and all the house of his father came down and took him and brought him up and buried him between zorah and eshtaol in the buryingplace of manoah his father and he judged israel twenty years
and there was a man of mount ephraim whose name was micah
and he said unto his mother the eleven hundred shekels of silver that were taken from thee about which thou cursedst and spakest of also in mine ears behold the silver is with me i took it and his mother said blessed be thou of the lord my son
and when he had restored the eleven hundred shekels of silver to his mother his mother said i had wholly dedicated the silver unto the lord from my hand for my son to make a graven image and a molten image now therefore i will restore it unto thee
yet he restored the money unto his mother and his mother took two hundred shekels of silver and gave them to the founder who made thereof a graven image and a molten image and they were in the house of micah
and the man micah had an house of gods and made an ephod and teraphim and consecrated one of his sons who became his priest
in those days there was no king in israel but every man did that which was right in his own eyes
and there was a young man out of bethlehemjudah of the family of judah who was a levite and he sojourned there
and the man departed out of the city from bethlehemjudah to sojourn where he could find a place and he came to mount ephraim to the house of micah as he journeyed
and micah said unto him whence comest thou and he said unto him i am a levite of bethlehemjudah and i go to sojourn where i may find a place
and micah said unto him dwell with me and be unto me a father and a priest and i will give thee ten shekels of silver by the year and a suit of apparel and thy victuals so the levite went in
and the levite was content to dwell with the man and the young man was unto him as one of his sons
and micah consecrated the levite and the young man became his priest and was in the house of micah
then said micah now know i that the lord will do me good seeing i have a levite to my priest
in those days there was no king in israel and in those days the tribe of the danites sought them an inheritance to dwell in for unto that day all their inheritance had not fallen unto them among the tribes of israel
and the children of dan sent of their family five men from their coasts men of valour from zorah and from eshtaol to spy out the land and to search it and they said unto them go search the land who when they came to mount ephraim to the house of micah they lodged there
when they were by the house of micah they knew the voice of the young man the levite and they turned in thither and said unto him who brought thee hither and what makest thou in this place and what hast thou here
and he said unto them thus and thus dealeth micah with me and hath hired me and i am his priest
