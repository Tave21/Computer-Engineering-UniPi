macbeth i hear it by the way but i will send
 there's not a one of them but in his house
 i keep a servant fee'd i will tomorrow
 and betimes i will to the weird sisters
 more shall they speak for now i am bent to know
 by the worst means the worst for mine own good
 all causes shall give way i am in blood
 stepp'd in so far that should i wade no more
 returning were as tedious as go o'er
 strange things i have in head that will to hand
 which must be acted ere they may be scann'd
lady macbeth you lack the season of all natures sleep
macbeth come we'll to sleep my strange and selfabuse
 is the initiate fear that wants hard use
 we are yet but young in deed

act iii
scene v a heath
 thunder enter the three witches meeting hecate
first witch why how now hecate you look angerly
hecate have i not reason beldams as you are
 saucy and overbold how did you dare
 to trade and traffic with macbeth
 in riddles and affairs of death
 and i the mistress of your charms
 the close contriver of all harms
 was never call'd to bear my part
 or show the glory of our art
 and which is worse all you have done
 hath been but for a wayward son
 spiteful and wrathful who as others do
 loves for his own ends not for you
 but make amends now get you gone
 and at the pit of acheron
 meet me i the morning thither he
 will come to know his destiny
 your vessels and your spells provide
 your charms and every thing beside
 i am for the air this night i'll spend
 unto a dismal and a fatal end
 great business must be wrought ere noon
 upon the corner of the moon
 there hangs a vaporous drop profound
 i'll catch it ere it come to ground
 and that distill'd by magic sleights
 shall raise such artificial sprites
 as by the strength of their illusion
 shall draw him on to his confusion
 he shall spurn fate scorn death and bear
 he hopes bove wisdom grace and fear
 and you all know security
 is mortals chiefest enemy
 music and a song within come away come
 away &c
 hark i am call'd my little spirit see
 sits in a foggy cloud and stays for me
 exit
first witch come let's make haste she'll soon be back again

act iii
scene vi forres the palace
 enter lennox and another lord
lennox my former speeches have but hit your thoughts
 which can interpret further only i say
 things have been strangely borne the
 gracious duncan
 was pitied of macbeth marry he was dead
 and the rightvaliant banquo walk'd too late
 whom you may say if't please you fleance kill'd
 for fleance fled men must not walk too late
 who cannot want the thought how monstrous
 it was for malcolm and for donalbain
 to kill their gracious father damned fact
 how it did grieve macbeth did he not straight
 in pious rage the two delinquents tear
 that were the slaves of drink and thralls of sleep
 was not that nobly done ay and wisely too
 for twould have anger'd any heart alive
 to hear the men deny't so that i say
 he has borne all things well and i do think
 that had he duncan's sons under his key
 as an't please heaven he shall notthey
 should find
 what twere to kill a father so should fleance
 but peace for from broad words and cause he fail'd
 his presence at the tyrant's feast i hear
 macduff lives in disgrace sir can you tell
 where he bestows himself
lord the son of duncan
 from whom this tyrant holds the due of birth
 lives in the english court and is received
 of the most pious edward with such grace
 that the malevolence of fortune nothing
 takes from his high respect thither macduff
 is gone to pray the holy king upon his aid
 to wake northumberland and warlike siward
 that by the help of thesewith him above
 to ratify the workwe may again
 give to our tables meat sleep to our nights
 free from our feasts and banquets bloody knives
 do faithful homage and receive free honours
 all which we pine for now and this report
 hath so exasperate the king that he
 prepares for some attempt of war
lennox sent he to macduff
lord he did and with an absolute sir not i'
 the cloudy messenger turns me his back
 and hums as who should say you'll rue the time
 that clogs me with this answer'
lennox and that well might
 advise him to a caution to hold what distance
 his wisdom can provide some holy angel
 fly to the court of england and unfold
 his message ere he come that a swift blessing
 may soon return to this our suffering country
 under a hand accursed
lord i'll send my prayers with him

 though palaces and pyramids do slope
 their heads to their foundations though the treasure
 of nature's germens tumble all together
 even till destruction sicken answer me
