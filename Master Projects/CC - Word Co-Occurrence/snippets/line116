and were baptized of him in jordan confessing their sins
but when he saw many of the pharisees and sadducees come to his baptism he said unto them o generation of vipers who hath warned you to flee from the wrath to come
bring forth therefore fruits meet for repentance
and think not to say within yourselves we have abraham to our father for i say unto you that god is able of these stones to raise up children unto abraham
and now also the axe is laid unto the root of the trees therefore every tree which bringeth not forth good fruit is hewn down and cast into the fire
i indeed baptize you with water unto repentance but he that cometh after me is mightier than i whose shoes i am not worthy to bear he shall baptize you with the holy ghost and with fire
whose fan is in his hand and he will throughly purge his floor and gather his wheat into the garner but he will burn up the chaff with unquenchable fire
then cometh jesus from galilee to jordan unto john to be baptized of him
but john forbad him saying i have need to be baptized of thee and comest thou to me
and jesus answering said unto him suffer it to be so now for thus it becometh us to fulfil all righteousness then he suffered him
and jesus when he was baptized went up straightway out of the water and lo the heavens were opened unto him and he saw the spirit of god descending like a dove and lighting upon him
and lo a voice from heaven saying this is my beloved son in whom i am well pleased
then was jesus led up of the spirit into the wilderness to be tempted of the devil
and when he had fasted forty days and forty nights he was afterward an hungred
and when the tempter came to him he said if thou be the son of god command that these stones be made bread
but he answered and said it is written man shall not live by bread alone but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of god
then the devil taketh him up into the holy city and setteth him on a pinnacle of the temple
and saith unto him if thou be the son of god cast thyself down for it is written he shall give his angels charge concerning thee and in their hands they shall bear thee up lest at any time thou dash thy foot against a stone
jesus said unto him it is written again thou shalt not tempt the lord thy god
again the devil taketh him up into an exceeding high mountain and sheweth him all the kingdoms of the world and the glory of them
and saith unto him all these things will i give thee if thou wilt fall down and worship me
then saith jesus unto him get thee hence satan for it is written thou shalt worship the lord thy god and him only shalt thou serve
then the devil leaveth him and behold angels came and ministered unto him
now when jesus had heard that john was cast into prison he departed into galilee
and leaving nazareth he came and dwelt in capernaum which is upon the sea coast in the borders of zabulon and nephthalim
that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by esaias the prophet saying
the land of zabulon and the land of nephthalim by the way of the sea beyond jordan galilee of the gentiles
the people which sat in darkness saw great light and to them which sat in the region and shadow of death light is sprung up
from that time jesus began to preach and to say repent for the kingdom of heaven is at hand
and jesus walking by the sea of galilee saw two brethren simon called peter and andrew his brother casting a net into the sea for they were fishers
and he saith unto them follow me and i will make you fishers of men
and they straightway left their nets and followed him
and going on from thence he saw other two brethren james the son of zebedee and john his brother in a ship with zebedee their father mending their nets and he called them
and they immediately left the ship and their father and followed him
and jesus went about all galilee teaching in their synagogues and preaching the gospel of the kingdom and healing all manner of sickness and all manner of disease among the people
and his fame went throughout all syria and they brought unto him all sick people that were taken with divers diseases and torments and those which were possessed with devils and those which were lunatick and those that had the palsy and he healed them
and there followed him great multitudes of people from galilee and from decapolis and from jerusalem and from judaea and from beyond jordan
and seeing the multitudes he went up into a mountain and when he was set his disciples came unto him
and he opened his mouth and taught them saying
blessed are the poor in spirit for theirs is the kingdom of heaven
blessed are they that mourn for they shall be comforted
blessed are the meek for they shall inherit the earth
blessed are they which do hunger and thirst after righteousness for they shall be filled
blessed are the merciful for they shall obtain mercy
blessed are the pure in heart for they shall see god
blessed are the peacemakers for they shall be called the children of god
blessed are they which are persecuted for righteousness sake for theirs is the kingdom of heaven
blessed are ye when men shall revile you and persecute you and shall say all manner of evil against you falsely for my sake
rejoice and be exceeding glad for great is your reward in heaven for so persecuted they the prophets which were before you
ye are the salt of the earth but if the salt have lost his savour wherewith shall it be salted it is thenceforth good for nothing but to be cast out and to be trodden under foot of men
ye are the light of the world a city that is set on an hill cannot be hid
neither do men light a candle and put it under a bushel but on a candlestick and it giveth light unto all that are in the house
let your light so shine before men that they may see your good works and glorify your father which is in heaven
think not that i am come to destroy the law or the prophets i am not come to destroy but to fulfil
for verily i say unto you till heaven and earth pass one jot or one tittle shall in no wise pass from the law till all be fulfilled
whosoever therefore shall break one of these least commandments and shall teach men so he shall be called the least in the kingdom of heaven but whosoever shall do and teach them the same shall be called great in the kingdom of heaven
for i say unto you that except your righteousness shall exceed the righteousness of the scribes and pharisees ye shall in no case enter into the kingdom of heaven
ye have heard that it was said by them of old time thou shalt not kill and whosoever shall kill shall be in danger of the judgment
but i say unto you that whosoever is angry with his brother without a cause shall be in danger of the judgment and whosoever shall say to his brother raca shall be in danger of the council but whosoever shall say thou fool shall be in danger of hell fire
therefore if thou bring thy gift to the altar and there rememberest that thy brother hath ought against thee
leave there thy gift before the altar and go thy way first be reconciled to thy brother and then come and offer thy gift
agree with thine adversary quickly whiles thou art in the way with him lest at any time the adversary deliver thee to the judge and the judge deliver thee to the officer and thou be cast into prison
verily i say unto thee thou shalt by no means come out thence till thou hast paid the uttermost farthing
ye have heard that it was said by them of old time thou shalt not commit adultery
but i say unto you that whosoever looketh on a woman to lust after her hath committed adultery with her already in his heart
and if thy right eye offend thee pluck it out and cast it from thee for it is profitable for thee that one of thy members should perish and not that thy whole body should be cast into hell
and if thy right hand offend thee cut it off and cast it from thee for it is profitable for thee that one of thy members should perish and not that thy whole body should be cast into hell
it hath been said whosoever shall put away his wife let him give her a writing of divorcement
but i say unto you that whosoever shall put away his wife saving for the cause of fornication causeth her to commit adultery and whosoever shall marry her that is divorced committeth adultery
again ye have heard that it hath been said by them of old time thou shalt not forswear thyself but shalt perform unto the lord thine oaths
but i say unto you swear not at all neither by heaven for it is god's throne
nor by the earth for it is his footstool neither by jerusalem for it is the city of the great king
neither shalt thou swear by thy head because thou canst not make one hair white or black
but let your communication be yea yea nay nay for whatsoever is more than these cometh of evil
ye have heard that it hath been said an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth
but i say unto you that ye resist not evil but whosoever shall smite thee on thy right cheek turn to him the other also
and if any man will sue thee at the law and take away thy coat let him have thy cloak also
and whosoever shall compel thee to go a mile go with him twain
give to him that asketh thee and from him that would borrow of thee turn not thou away
ye have heard that it hath been said thou shalt love thy neighbour and hate thine enemy
but i say unto you love your enemies bless them that curse you do good to them that hate you and pray for them which despitefully use you and persecute you
that ye may be the children of your father which is in heaven for he maketh his sun to rise on the evil and on the good and sendeth rain on the just and on the unjust
for if ye love them which love you what reward have ye do not even the publicans the same
and if ye salute your brethren only what do ye more than others do not even the publicans so
be ye therefore perfect even as your father which is in heaven is perfect
take heed that ye do not your alms before men to be seen of them otherwise ye have no reward of your father which is in heaven
therefore when thou doest thine alms do not sound a trumpet before thee as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and in the streets that they may have glory of men verily i say unto you they have their reward
but when thou doest alms let not thy left hand know what thy right hand doeth
that thine alms may be in secret and thy father which seeth in secret himself shall reward thee openly
and when thou prayest thou shalt not be as the hypocrites are for they love to pray standing in the synagogues and in the corners of the streets that they may be seen of men verily i say unto you they have their reward
but thou when thou prayest enter into thy closet and when thou hast shut thy door pray to thy father which is in secret and thy father which seeth in secret shall reward thee openly
but when ye pray use not vain repetitions as the heathen do for they think that they shall be heard for their much speaking
be not ye therefore like unto them for your father knoweth what things ye have need of before ye ask him
after this manner therefore pray ye our father which art in heaven hallowed be thy name
thy kingdom come thy will be done in earth as it is in heaven
give us this day our daily bread
and forgive us our debts as we forgive our debtors
and lead us not into temptation but deliver us from evil for thine is the kingdom and the power and the glory for ever amen
for if ye forgive men their trespasses your heavenly father will also forgive you
but if ye forgive not men their trespasses neither will your father forgive your trespasses
moreover when ye fast be not as the hypocrites of a sad countenance for they disfigure their faces that they may appear unto men to fast verily i say unto you they have their reward
but thou when thou fastest anoint thine head and wash thy face
that thou appear not unto men to fast but unto thy father which is in secret and thy father which seeth in secret shall reward thee openly
lay not up for yourselves treasures upon earth where moth and rust doth corrupt and where thieves break through and steal
but lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven where neither moth nor rust doth corrupt and where thieves do not break through nor steal
for where your treasure is there will your heart be also
the light of the body is the eye if therefore thine eye be single thy whole body shall be full of light
but if thine eye be evil thy whole body shall be full of darkness if therefore the light that is in thee be darkness how great is that darkness
no man can serve two masters for either he will hate the one and love the other or else he will hold to the one and despise the other ye cannot serve god and mammon
therefore i say unto you take no thought for your life what ye shall eat or what ye shall drink nor yet for your body what ye shall put on is not the life more than meat and the body than raiment
behold the fowls of the air for they sow not neither do they reap nor gather into barns yet your heavenly father feedeth them are ye not much better than they
which of you by taking thought can add one cubit unto his stature
and why take ye thought for raiment consider the lilies of the field how they grow they toil not neither do they spin
and yet i say unto you that even solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these
wherefore if god so clothe the grass of the field which to day is and to morrow is cast into the oven shall he not much more clothe you o ye of little faith
therefore take no thought saying what shall we eat or what shall we drink or wherewithal shall we be clothed
for after all these things do the gentiles seek for your heavenly father knoweth that ye have need of all these things
but seek ye first the kingdom of god and his righteousness and all these things shall be added unto you
take therefore no thought for the morrow for the morrow shall take thought for the things of itself sufficient unto the day is the evil thereof
judge not that ye be not judged
for with what judgment ye judge ye shall be judged and with what measure ye mete it shall be measured to you again
and why beholdest thou the mote that is in thy brother's eye but considerest not the beam that is in thine own eye
or how wilt thou say to thy brother let me pull out the mote out of thine eye and behold a beam is in thine own eye
thou hypocrite first cast out the beam out of thine own eye and then shalt thou see clearly to cast out the mote out of thy brother's eye
give not that which is holy unto the dogs neither cast ye your pearls before swine lest they trample them under their feet and turn again and rend you
ask and it shall be given you seek and ye shall find knock and it shall be opened unto you
for every one that asketh receiveth and he that seeketh findeth and to him that knocketh it shall be opened
or what man is there of you whom if his son ask bread will he give him a stone
or if he ask a fish will he give him a serpent
if ye then being evil know how to give good gifts unto your children how much more shall your father which is in heaven give good things to them that ask him
therefore all things whatsoever ye would that men should do to you do ye even so to them for this is the law and the prophets
enter ye in at the strait gate for wide is the gate and broad is the way that leadeth to destruction and many there be which go in thereat
because strait is the gate and narrow is the way which leadeth unto life and few there be that find it
beware of false prophets which come to you in sheep's clothing but inwardly they are ravening wolves
ye shall know them by their fruits do men gather grapes of thorns or figs of thistles
even so every good tree bringeth forth good fruit but a corrupt tree bringeth forth evil fruit
a good tree cannot bring forth evil fruit neither can a corrupt tree bring forth good fruit
every tree that bringeth not forth good fruit is hewn down and cast into the fire
wherefore by their fruits ye shall know them
not every one that saith unto me lord lord shall enter into the kingdom of heaven but he that doeth the will of my father which is in heaven
many will say to me in that day lord lord have we not prophesied in thy name and in thy name have cast out devils and in thy name done many wonderful works
and then will i profess unto them i never knew you depart from me ye that work iniquity
therefore whosoever heareth these sayings of mine and doeth them i will liken him unto a wise man which built his house upon a rock
and the rain descended and the floods came and the winds blew and beat upon that house and it fell not for it was founded upon a rock
and every one that heareth these sayings of mine and doeth them not shall be likened unto a foolish man which built his house upon the sand
and the rain descended and the floods came and the winds blew and beat upon that house and it fell and great was the fall of it
and it came to pass when jesus had ended these sayings the people were astonished at his doctrine
for he taught them as one having authority and not as the scribes
when he was come down from the mountain great multitudes followed him
and behold there came a leper and worshipped him saying lord if thou wilt thou canst make me clean
and jesus put forth his hand and touched him saying i will be thou clean and immediately his leprosy was cleansed
and jesus saith unto him see thou tell no man but go thy way shew thyself to the priest and offer the gift that moses commanded for a testimony unto them
and when jesus was entered into capernaum there came unto him a centurion beseeching him
and saying lord my servant lieth at home sick of the palsy grievously tormented
and jesus saith unto him i will come and heal him
the centurion answered and said lord i am not worthy that thou shouldest come under my roof but speak the word only and my servant shall be healed
for i am a man under authority having soldiers under me and i say to this man go and he goeth and to another come and he cometh and to my servant do this and he doeth it
when jesus heard it he marvelled and said to them that followed verily i say unto you i have not found so great faith no not in israel
and i say unto you that many shall come from the east and west and shall sit down with abraham and isaac and jacob in the kingdom of heaven
but the children of the kingdom shall be cast out into outer darkness there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth
and jesus said unto the centurion go thy way and as thou hast believed so be it done unto thee and his servant was healed in the selfsame hour
and when jesus was come into peter's house he saw his wife's mother laid and sick of a fever
and he touched her hand and the fever left her and she arose and ministered unto them
when the even was come they brought unto him many that were possessed with devils and he cast out the spirits with his word and healed all that were sick
that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by esaias the prophet saying himself took our infirmities and bare our sicknesses
now when jesus saw great multitudes about him he gave commandment to depart unto the other side
and a certain scribe came and said unto him master i will follow thee whithersoever thou goest
and jesus saith unto him the foxes have holes and the birds of the air have nests but the son of man hath not where to lay his head
and another of his disciples said unto him lord suffer me first to go and bury my father
but jesus said unto him follow me and let the dead bury their dead
and when he was entered into a ship his disciples followed him
and behold there arose a great tempest in the sea insomuch that the ship was covered with the waves but he was asleep
and his disciples came to him and awoke him saying lord save us we perish
and he saith unto them why are ye fearful o ye of little faith then he arose and rebuked the winds and the sea and there was a great calm
but the men marvelled saying what manner of man is this that even the winds and the sea obey him
and when he was come to the other side into the country of the gergesenes there met him two possessed with devils coming out of the tombs exceeding fierce so that no man might pass by that way
and behold they cried out saying what have we to do with thee jesus thou son of god art thou come hither to torment us before the time
and there was a good way off from them an herd of many swine feeding
so the devils besought him saying if thou cast us out suffer us to go away into the herd of swine
and he said unto them go and when they were come out they went into the herd of swine and behold the whole herd of swine ran violently down a steep place into the sea and perished in the waters
and they that kept them fled and went their ways into the city and told every thing and what was befallen to the possessed of the devils
and behold the whole city came out to meet jesus and when they saw him they besought him that he would depart out of their coasts
and he entered into a ship and passed over and came into his own city
and behold they brought to him a man sick of the palsy lying on a bed and jesus seeing their faith said unto the sick of the palsy son be of good cheer thy sins be forgiven thee
and behold certain of the scribes said within themselves this man blasphemeth
and jesus knowing their thoughts said wherefore think ye evil in your hearts
for whether is easier to say thy sins be forgiven thee or to say arise and walk
but that ye may know that the son of man hath power on earth to forgive sins then saith he to the sick of the palsy arise take up thy bed and go unto thine house
and he arose and departed to his house
but when the multitudes saw it they marvelled and glorified god which had given such power unto men
and as jesus passed forth from thence he saw a man named matthew sitting at the receipt of custom and he saith unto him follow me and he arose and followed him
and it came to pass as jesus sat at meat in the house behold many publicans and sinners came and sat down with him and his disciples
and when the pharisees saw it they said unto his disciples why eateth your master with publicans and sinners
but when jesus heard that he said unto them they that be whole need not a physician but they that are sick
but go ye and learn what that meaneth i will have mercy and not sacrifice for i am not come to call the righteous but sinners to repentance
then came to him the disciples of john saying why do we and the pharisees fast oft but thy disciples fast not
and jesus said unto them can the children of the bridechamber mourn as long as the bridegroom is with them but the days will come when the bridegroom shall be taken from them and then shall they fast
no man putteth a piece of new cloth unto an old garment for that which is put in to fill it up taketh from the garment and the rent is made worse
neither do men put new wine into old bottles else the bottles break and the wine runneth out and the bottles perish but they put new wine into new bottles and both are preserved
while he spake these things unto them behold there came a certain ruler and worshipped him saying my daughter is even now dead but come and lay thy hand upon her and she shall live
