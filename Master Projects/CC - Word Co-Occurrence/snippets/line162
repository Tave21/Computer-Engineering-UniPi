act ii
scene vi near misenum
 flourish enter pompey and menas at one door
 with drum and trumpet at another octavius caesar
 mark antony lepidus domitius enobarbus mecaenas
 with soldiers marching
pompey your hostages i have so have you mine
 and we shall talk before we fight
octavius caesar most meet
 that first we come to words and therefore have we
 our written purposes before us sent
 which if thou hast consider'd let us know
 if twill tie up thy discontented sword
 and carry back to sicily much tall youth
 that else must perish here
pompey to you all three
 the senators alone of this great world
 chief factors for the gods i do not know
 wherefore my father should revengers want
 having a son and friends since julius caesar
 who at philippi the good brutus ghosted
 there saw you labouring for him what was't
 that moved pale cassius to conspire and what
 made the allhonour'd honest roman brutus
 with the arm'd rest courtiers and beauteous freedom
 to drench the capitol but that they would
 have one man but a man and that is it
 hath made me rig my navy at whose burthen
 the anger'd ocean foams with which i meant
 to scourge the ingratitude that despiteful rome
 cast on my noble father
octavius caesar take your time
mark antony thou canst not fear us pompey with thy sails
 we'll speak with thee at sea at land thou know'st
 how much we do o'ercount thee
pompey at land indeed
 thou dost o'ercount me of my father's house
 but since the cuckoo builds not for himself
 remain in't as thou mayst
lepidus be pleased to tell us
 for this is from the presenthow you take
 the offers we have sent you
octavius caesar there's the point
mark antony which do not be entreated to but weigh
 what it is worth embraced
octavius caesar and what may follow
 to try a larger fortune
pompey you have made me offer
 of sicily sardinia and i must
 rid all the sea of pirates then to send
 measures of wheat to rome this greed upon
 to part with unhack'd edges and bear back
 our targes undinted
octavius caesar 
 
mark antony that's our offer
 
lepidus 
pompey know then
 i came before you here a man prepared
 to take this offer but mark antony
 put me to some impatience though i lose
 the praise of it by telling you must know
 when caesar and your brother were at blows
 your mother came to sicily and did find
 her welcome friendly
mark antony i have heard it pompey
 and am well studied for a liberal thanks
 which i do owe you
pompey let me have your hand
 i did not think sir to have met you here
mark antony the beds i the east are soft and thanks to you
 that call'd me timelier than my purpose hither
 for i have gain'd by t
octavius caesar since i saw you last
 there is a change upon you
pompey well i know not
 what counts harsh fortune casts upon my face
 but in my bosom shall she never come
 to make my heart her vassal
lepidus well met here
pompey i hope so lepidus thus we are agreed
 i crave our composition may be written
 and seal'd between us
octavius caesar that's the next to do
pompey we'll feast each other ere we part and let's
 draw lots who shall begin
mark antony that will i pompey
pompey no antony take the lot but first
 or last your fine egyptian cookery
 shall have the fame i have heard that julius caesar
 grew fat with feasting there
mark antony you have heard much
pompey i have fair meanings sir
mark antony and fair words to them
pompey then so much have i heard
 and i have heard apollodorus carried
domitius enobarbus no more of that he did so
pompey what i pray you
domitius enobarbus a certain queen to caesar in a mattress
pompey i know thee now how farest thou soldier
domitius enobarbus well
 and well am like to do for i perceive
 four feasts are toward
pompey let me shake thy hand
 i never hated thee i have seen thee fight
 when i have envied thy behavior
domitius enobarbus sir
 i never loved you much but i ha praised ye
 when you have well deserved ten times as much
 as i have said you did
pompey enjoy thy plainness
 it nothing ill becomes thee
 aboard my galley i invite you all
 will you lead lords
octavius caesar 
 
mark antony show us the way sir
 
lepidus 
pompey come
 exeunt all but menas and enobarbus
menas aside thy father pompey would ne'er have
 made this treatyyou and i have known sir
domitius enobarbus at sea i think
menas we have sir
domitius enobarbus you have done well by water
menas and you by land
domitius enobarbus i will praise any man that will praise me though it
 cannot be denied what i have done by land
menas nor what i have done by water
domitius enobarbus yes something you can deny for your own
 safety you have been a great thief by sea
menas and you by land
domitius enobarbus there i deny my land service but give me your
 hand menas if our eyes had authority here they
 might take two thieves kissing
menas all men's faces are true whatsome'er their hands are
domitius enobarbus but there is never a fair woman has a true face
menas no slander they steal hearts
domitius enobarbus we came hither to fight with you
menas for my part i am sorry it is turned to a drinking
 pompey doth this day laugh away his fortune
domitius enobarbus if he do sure he cannot weep't back again
menas you've said sir we looked not for mark antony
 here pray you is he married to cleopatra
domitius enobarbus caesar's sister is called octavia
menas true sir she was the wife of caius marcellus
domitius enobarbus but she is now the wife of marcus antonius
menas pray ye sir
domitius enobarbus tis true
menas then is caesar and he for ever knit together
domitius enobarbus if i were bound to divine of this unity i would
 not prophesy so
menas i think the policy of that purpose made more in the
 marriage than the love of the parties
domitius enobarbus i think so too but you shall find the band that
 seems to tie their friendship together will be the
 very strangler of their amity octavia is of a
 holy cold and still conversation
menas who would not have his wife so
domitius enobarbus not he that himself is not so which is mark antony
 he will to his egyptian dish again then shall the
 sighs of octavia blow the fire up in caesar and as
 i said before that which is the strength of their
 amity shall prove the immediate author of their
 variance antony will use his affection where it is
 he married but his occasion here
menas and thus it may be come sir will you aboard
 i have a health for you
domitius enobarbus i shall take it sir we have used our throats in egypt
menas come let's away
