 which robs my tongue from breathing native breath
king richard ii it boots thee not to be compassionate
 after our sentence plaining comes too late
thomas mowbray then thus i turn me from my country's light
 to dwell in solemn shades of endless night
king richard ii return again and take an oath with thee
 lay on our royal sword your banish'd hands
 swear by the duty that you owe to god
 our part therein we banish with yourselves
 to keep the oath that we administer
 you never shall so help you truth and god
 embrace each other's love in banishment
 nor never look upon each other's face
 nor never write regreet nor reconcile
 this louring tempest of your homebred hate
 nor never by advised purpose meet
 to plot contrive or complot any ill
 gainst us our state our subjects or our land
henry bolingbroke i swear
thomas mowbray and i to keep all this
henry bolingbroke norfolk so far as to mine enemy
 by this time had the king permitted us
 one of our souls had wander'd in the air
 banish'd this frail sepulchre of our flesh
 as now our flesh is banish'd from this land
 confess thy treasons ere thou fly the realm
 since thou hast far to go bear not along
 the clogging burthen of a guilty soul
thomas mowbray no bolingbroke if ever i were traitor
 my name be blotted from the book of life
 and i from heaven banish'd as from hence
 but what thou art god thou and i do know
 and all too soon i fear the king shall rue
 farewell my liege now no way can i stray
 save back to england all the world's my way
 exit
king richard ii uncle even in the glasses of thine eyes
 i see thy grieved heart thy sad aspect
 hath from the number of his banish'd years
 pluck'd four away
 to henry bolingbroke
 six frozen winter spent
 return with welcome home from banishment
henry bolingbroke how long a time lies in one little word
 four lagging winters and four wanton springs
 end in a word such is the breath of kings
john of gaunt i thank my liege that in regard of me
 he shortens four years of my son's exile
 but little vantage shall i reap thereby
 for ere the six years that he hath to spend
 can change their moons and bring their times about
 my oildried lamp and timebewasted light
 shall be extinct with age and endless night
 my inch of taper will be burnt and done
 and blindfold death not let me see my son
king richard ii why uncle thou hast many years to live
john of gaunt but not a minute king that thou canst give
 shorten my days thou canst with sullen sorrow
 and pluck nights from me but not lend a morrow
 thou canst help time to furrow me with age
 but stop no wrinkle in his pilgrimage
 thy word is current with him for my death
 but dead thy kingdom cannot buy my breath
king richard ii thy son is banish'd upon good advice
 whereto thy tongue a partyverdict gave
 why at our justice seem'st thou then to lour
john of gaunt things sweet to taste prove in digestion sour
 you urged me as a judge but i had rather
 you would have bid me argue like a father
 o had it been a stranger not my child
 to smooth his fault i should have been more mild
 a partial slander sought i to avoid
 and in the sentence my own life destroy'd
 alas i look'd when some of you should say
 i was too strict to make mine own away
 but you gave leave to my unwilling tongue
 against my will to do myself this wrong
king richard ii cousin farewell and uncle bid him so
 six years we banish him and he shall go
 flourish exeunt king richard ii and train
duke of aumerle cousin farewell what presence must not know
 from where you do remain let paper show
lord marshal my lord no leave take i for i will ride
 as far as land will let me by your side
john of gaunt o to what purpose dost thou hoard thy words
 that thou return'st no greeting to thy friends
henry bolingbroke i have too few to take my leave of you
 when the tongue's office should be prodigal
 to breathe the abundant dolour of the heart
john of gaunt thy grief is but thy absence for a time
henry bolingbroke joy absent grief is present for that time
john of gaunt what is six winters they are quickly gone
henry bolingbroke to men in joy but grief makes one hour ten
john of gaunt call it a travel that thou takest for pleasure
henry bolingbroke my heart will sigh when i miscall it so
 which finds it an inforced pilgrimage
john of gaunt the sullen passage of thy weary steps
 esteem as foil wherein thou art to set
 the precious jewel of thy home return
henry bolingbroke nay rather every tedious stride i make
 will but remember me what a deal of world
 i wander from the jewels that i love
 must i not serve a long apprenticehood
 to foreign passages and in the end
 having my freedom boast of nothing else
 but that i was a journeyman to grief
john of gaunt all places that the eye of heaven visits
 are to a wise man ports and happy havens
 teach thy necessity to reason thus
 there is no virtue like necessity
 think not the king did banish thee
 but thou the king woe doth the heavier sit
 where it perceives it is but faintly borne
 go say i sent thee forth to purchase honour
 and not the king exiled thee or suppose
 devouring pestilence hangs in our air
 and thou art flying to a fresher clime
 look what thy soul holds dear imagine it
 to lie that way thou go'st not whence thou comest
 suppose the singing birds musicians
 the grass whereon thou tread'st the presence strew'd
 the flowers fair ladies and thy steps no more
 than a delightful measure or a dance
 for gnarling sorrow hath less power to bite
 the man that mocks at it and sets it light
henry bolingbroke o who can hold a fire in his hand
 by thinking on the frosty caucasus
 or cloy the hungry edge of appetite
 by bare imagination of a feast
 or wallow naked in december snow
 by thinking on fantastic summer's heat
 o no the apprehension of the good
 gives but the greater feeling to the worse
 fell sorrow's tooth doth never rankle more
 than when he bites but lanceth not the sore
john of gaunt come come my son i'll bring thee on thy way
 had i thy youth and cause i would not stay
henry bolingbroke then england's ground farewell sweet soil adieu
 my mother and my nurse that bears me yet
 where'er i wander boast of this i can
 though banish'd yet a trueborn englishman
 exeunt
 king richard ii
act i
scene iv the court
 enter king richard ii with bagot and green at one
 door and the duke of aumerle at another
king richard ii we did observe cousin aumerle
 how far brought you high hereford on his way
duke of aumerle i brought high hereford if you call him so
 but to the next highway and there i left him
king richard ii and say what store of parting tears were shed
duke of aumerle faith none for me except the northeast wind
 which then blew bitterly against our faces
 awaked the sleeping rheum and so by chance
 did grace our hollow parting with a tear
king richard ii what said our cousin when you parted with him
duke of aumerle farewell'
 and for my heart disdained that my tongue
 should so profane the word that taught me craft
 to counterfeit oppression of such grief
 that words seem'd buried in my sorrow's grave
 marry would the word farewell have lengthen'd hours
 and added years to his short banishment
 he should have had a volume of farewells
 but since it would not he had none of me
king richard ii he is our cousin cousin but tis doubt
 when time shall call him home from banishment
 whether our kinsman come to see his friends
 ourself and bushy bagot here and green
 observed his courtship to the common people
 how he did seem to dive into their hearts
 with humble and familiar courtesy
 what reverence he did throw away on slaves
 wooing poor craftsmen with the craft of smiles
 and patient underbearing of his fortune
 as twere to banish their affects with him
 off goes his bonnet to an oysterwench
 a brace of draymen bid god speed him well
 and had the tribute of his supple knee
 with thanks my countrymen my loving friends'
 as were our england in reversion his
 and he our subjects next degree in hope
green well he is gone and with him go these thoughts
 now for the rebels which stand out in ireland
 expedient manage must be made my liege
 ere further leisure yield them further means
 for their advantage and your highness loss
king richard ii we will ourself in person to this war
 and for our coffers with too great a court
 and liberal largess are grown somewhat light
 we are inforced to farm our royal realm
 the revenue whereof shall furnish us
 for our affairs in hand if that come short
 our substitutes at home shall have blank charters
 whereto when they shall know what men are rich
 they shall subscribe them for large sums of gold
 and send them after to supply our wants
 for we will make for ireland presently
