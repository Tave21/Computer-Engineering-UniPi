 his lands then seized on by the conqueror
 her suit is now to repossess those lands
 which we in justice cannot well deny
 because in quarrel of the house of york
 the worthy gentleman did lose his life
gloucester your highness shall do well to grant her suit
 it were dishonour to deny it her
king edward iv it were no less but yet i'll make a pause
gloucester aside to clarence yea is it so
 i see the lady hath a thing to grant
 before the king will grant her humble suit
clarence aside to gloucester he knows the game how true
 he keeps the wind
gloucester aside to clarence silence
king edward iv widow we will consider of your suit
 and come some other time to know our mind
lady grey right gracious lord i cannot brook delay
 may it please your highness to resolve me now
 and what your pleasure is shall satisfy me
gloucester aside to clarence ay widow then i'll warrant
 you all your lands
 an if what pleases him shall pleasure you
 fight closer or good faith you'll catch a blow
clarence aside to gloucester i fear her not unless she
 chance to fall
gloucester aside to clarence god forbid that for he'll
 take vantages
king edward iv how many children hast thou widow tell me
clarence aside to gloucester i think he means to beg a
 child of her
gloucester aside to clarence nay whip me then he'll rather
 give her two
lady grey three my most gracious lord
gloucester aside to clarence you shall have four if you'll
 be ruled by him
king edward iv twere pity they should lose their father's lands
lady grey be pitiful dread lord and grant it then
king edward iv lords give us leave i'll try this widow's wit
gloucester aside to clarence ay good leave have you for
 you will have leave
 till youth take leave and leave you to the crutch
 gloucester and clarence retire
king edward iv now tell me madam do you love your children
lady grey ay full as dearly as i love myself
king edward iv and would you not do much to do them good
lady grey to do them good i would sustain some harm
king edward iv then get your husband's lands to do them good
lady grey therefore i came unto your majesty
king edward iv i'll tell you how these lands are to be got
lady grey so shall you bind me to your highness service
king edward iv what service wilt thou do me if i give them
lady grey what you command that rests in me to do
king edward iv but you will take exceptions to my boon
lady grey no gracious lord except i cannot do it
king edward iv ay but thou canst do what i mean to ask
lady grey why then i will do what your grace commands
gloucester aside to clarence he plies her hard and much rain
 wears the marble
clarence aside to gloucester as red as fire nay then
 her wax must melt
lady grey why stops my lord shall i not hear my task
king edward iv an easy task tis but to love a king
lady grey that's soon perform'd because i am a subject
king edward iv why then thy husband's lands i freely give thee
lady grey i take my leave with many thousand thanks
gloucester aside to clarence the match is made she seals it
 with a curtsy
king edward iv but stay thee tis the fruits of love i mean
lady grey the fruits of love i mean my loving liege
king edward iv ay but i fear me in another sense
 what love think'st thou i sue so much to get
lady grey my love till death my humble thanks my prayers
 that love which virtue begs and virtue grants
king edward iv no by my troth i did not mean such love
lady grey why then you mean not as i thought you did
king edward iv but now you partly may perceive my mind
lady grey my mind will never grant what i perceive
 your highness aims at if i aim aright
king edward iv to tell thee plain i aim to lie with thee
lady grey to tell you plain i had rather lie in prison
king edward iv why then thou shalt not have thy husband's lands
lady grey why then mine honesty shall be my dower
 for by that loss i will not purchase them
king edward iv therein thou wrong'st thy children mightily
lady grey herein your highness wrongs both them and me
 but mighty lord this merry inclination
 accords not with the sadness of my suit
 please you dismiss me either with ay or no'
king edward iv ay if thou wilt say ay to my request
 no if thou dost say no to my demand
lady grey then no my lord my suit is at an end
gloucester aside to clarence the widow likes him not she
 knits her brows
clarence aside to gloucester he is the bluntest wooer in
 christendom
king edward iv aside her looks do argue her replete with modesty
 her words do show her wit incomparable
 all her perfections challenge sovereignty
 one way or other she is for a king
 and she shall be my love or else my queen
 say that king edward take thee for his queen
lady grey tis better said than done my gracious lord
 i am a subject fit to jest withal
 but far unfit to be a sovereign
king edward iv sweet widow by my state i swear to thee
 i speak no more than what my soul intends
 and that is to enjoy thee for my love
lady grey and that is more than i will yield unto
 i know i am too mean to be your queen
 and yet too good to be your concubine
king edward iv you cavil widow i did mean my queen
lady grey twill grieve your grace my sons should call you father
king edward iv no more than when my daughters call thee mother
 thou art a widow and thou hast some children
 and by god's mother i being but a bachelor
 have other some why tis a happy thing
 to be the father unto many sons
 answer no more for thou shalt be my queen
gloucester aside to clarence the ghostly father now hath done
 his shrift
clarence aside to gloucester when he was made a shriver
 twas for shift
king edward iv brothers you muse what chat we two have had
gloucester the widow likes it not for she looks very sad
king edward iv you'll think it strange if i should marry her
clarence to whom my lord
king edward iv why clarence to myself
gloucester that would be ten days wonder at the least
clarence that's a day longer than a wonder lasts
gloucester by so much is the wonder in extremes
king edward iv well jest on brothers i can tell you both
 her suit is granted for her husband's lands
 enter a nobleman
nobleman my gracious lord henry your foe is taken
 and brought your prisoner to your palace gate
king edward iv see that he be convey'd unto the tower
 and go we brothers to the man that took him
 to question of his apprehension
 widow go you along lords use her honourably
 exeunt all but gloucester
gloucester ay edward will use women honourably
 would he were wasted marrow bones and all
 that from his loins no hopeful branch may spring
 to cross me from the golden time i look for
 and yet between my soul's desire and me
 the lustful edward's title buried
 is clarence henry and his son young edward
 and all the unlook'd for issue of their bodies
 to take their rooms ere i can place myself
 a cold premeditation for my purpose
 why then i do but dream on sovereignty
 like one that stands upon a promontory
 and spies a faroff shore where he would tread
 wishing his foot were equal with his eye
 and chides the sea that sunders him from thence
 saying he'll lade it dry to have his way
 so do i wish the crown being so far off
 and so i chide the means that keeps me from it
 and so i say i'll cut the causes off
 flattering me with impossibilities
 my eye's too quick my heart o'erweens too much
 unless my hand and strength could equal them
 well say there is no kingdom then for richard
 what other pleasure can the world afford
 i'll make my heaven in a lady's lap
 and deck my body in gay ornaments
 and witch sweet ladies with my words and looks
 o miserable thought and more unlikely
 than to accomplish twenty golden crowns
 why love forswore me in my mother's womb
 and for i should not deal in her soft laws
 she did corrupt frail nature with some bribe
 to shrink mine arm up like a wither'd shrub
 to make an envious mountain on my back
 where sits deformity to mock my body
 to shape my legs of an unequal size
 to disproportion me in every part
 like to a chaos or an unlick'd bearwhelp
 that carries no impression like the dam
 and am i then a man to be beloved
 o monstrous fault to harbour such a thought
 then since this earth affords no joy to me
 but to command to cheque to o'erbear such
 as are of better person than myself
 i'll make my heaven to dream upon the crown
 and whiles i live to account this world but hell
 until my misshaped trunk that bears this head
 be round impaled with a glorious crown
 and yet i know not how to get the crown
 for many lives stand between me and home
 and ilike one lost in a thorny wood
 that rends the thorns and is rent with the thorns
 seeking a way and straying from the way
 not knowing how to find the open air
 but toiling desperately to find it out
 torment myself to catch the english crown
 and from that torment i will free myself
 or hew my way out with a bloody axe
 why i can smile and murder whiles i smile
 and cry content to that which grieves my heart
