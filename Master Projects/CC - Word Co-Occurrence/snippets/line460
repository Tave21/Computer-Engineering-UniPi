 did i deserve no more than a fool's head
 is that my prize are my deserts no better
portia to offend and judge are distinct offices
 and of opposed natures
arragon what is here
 reads
 the fire seven times tried this
 seven times tried that judgment is
 that did never choose amiss
 some there be that shadows kiss
 such have but a shadow's bliss
 there be fools alive i wis
 silver'd o'er and so was this
 take what wife you will to bed
 i will ever be your head
 so be gone you are sped
 still more fool i shall appear
 by the time i linger here
 with one fool's head i came to woo
 but i go away with two
 sweet adieu i'll keep my oath
 patiently to bear my wroth
 exeunt arragon and train
portia thus hath the candle singed the moth
 o these deliberate fools when they do choose
 they have the wisdom by their wit to lose
nerissa the ancient saying is no heresy
 hanging and wiving goes by destiny
portia come draw the curtain nerissa
 enter a servant
servant where is my lady
portia here what would my lord
servant madam there is alighted at your gate
 a young venetian one that comes before
 to signify the approaching of his lord
 from whom he bringeth sensible regreets

 so likely an ambassador of love
 a day in april never came so sweet
 to show how costly summer was at hand
 as this forespurrer comes before his lord

 thou wilt say anon he is some kin to thee
 thou spend'st such highday wit in praising him

act iii
scene i venice a street
 enter salanio and salarino
salanio now what news on the rialto
salarino why yet it lives there uncheck'd that antonio hath
 a ship of rich lading wrecked on the narrow seas
 the goodwins i think they call the place a very
 dangerous flat and fatal where the carcasses of many
 a tall ship lie buried as they say if my gossip
 report be an honest woman of her word
salanio i would she were as lying a gossip in that as ever
 knapped ginger or made her neighbours believe she
 wept for the death of a third husband but it is
 true without any slips of prolixity or crossing the
 plain highway of talk that the good antonio the
 honest antonioo that i had a title good enough
 to keep his name company
salarino come the full stop
salanio ha what sayest thou why the end is he hath
 lost a ship
salarino i would it might prove the end of his losses
salanio let me say amen betimes lest the devil cross my
 prayer for here he comes in the likeness of a jew
 enter shylock
 how now shylock what news among the merchants
shylock you know none so well none so well as you of my
 daughter's flight
salarino that's certain i for my part knew the tailor
 that made the wings she flew withal
salanio and shylock for his own part knew the bird was
 fledged and then it is the complexion of them all
 to leave the dam
shylock she is damned for it
salanio that's certain if the devil may be her judge
shylock my own flesh and blood to rebel
salanio out upon it old carrion rebels it at these years
shylock i say my daughter is my flesh and blood
salarino there is more difference between thy flesh and hers
 than between jet and ivory more between your bloods
 than there is between red wine and rhenish but
 tell us do you hear whether antonio have had any
 loss at sea or no
shylock there i have another bad match a bankrupt a
 prodigal who dare scarce show his head on the
 rialto a beggar that was used to come so smug upon
 the mart let him look to his bond he was wont to
 call me usurer let him look to his bond he was
 wont to lend money for a christian courtesy let him
 look to his bond
salarino why i am sure if he forfeit thou wilt not take
 his flesh what's that good for
shylock to bait fish withal if it will feed nothing else
 it will feed my revenge he hath disgraced me and
 hindered me half a million laughed at my losses
 mocked at my gains scorned my nation thwarted my
 bargains cooled my friends heated mine
 enemies and what's his reason i am a jew hath
 not a jew eyes hath not a jew hands organs
 dimensions senses affections passions fed with
 the same food hurt with the same weapons subject
 to the same diseases healed by the same means
 warmed and cooled by the same winter and summer as
 a christian is if you prick us do we not bleed
 if you tickle us do we not laugh if you poison
 us do we not die and if you wrong us shall we not
 revenge if we are like you in the rest we will
 resemble you in that if a jew wrong a christian
 what is his humility revenge if a christian
 wrong a jew what should his sufferance be by
 christian example why revenge the villany you
 teach me i will execute and it shall go hard but i
 will better the instruction
 enter a servant
servant gentlemen my master antonio is at his house and
 desires to speak with you both

act iii
scene ii belmont a room in portia's house
 enter bassanio portia gratiano nerissa and
 attendants
portia i pray you tarry pause a day or two
 before you hazard for in choosing wrong
 i lose your company therefore forbear awhile
 there's something tells me but it is not love
 i would not lose you and you know yourself
 hate counsels not in such a quality
 but lest you should not understand me well
 and yet a maiden hath no tongue but thought
 i would detain you here some month or two
 before you venture for me i could teach you
 how to choose right but i am then forsworn
 so will i never be so may you miss me
 but if you do you'll make me wish a sin
 that i had been forsworn beshrew your eyes
 they have o'erlook'd me and divided me
 one half of me is yours the other half yours
 mine own i would say but if mine then yours
 and so all yours o these naughty times
