act iii
scene ii the same pandarus orchard
 enter pandarus and troilus's boy meeting
pandarus how now where's thy master at my cousin
 cressida's
boy no sir he stays for you to conduct him thither
pandarus o here he comes
 enter troilus
 how now how now
troilus sirrah walk off
 exit boy
pandarus have you seen my cousin
troilus no pandarus i stalk about her door
 like a strange soul upon the stygian banks
 staying for waftage o be thou my charon
 and give me swift transportance to those fields
 where i may wallow in the lilybeds
 proposed for the deserver o gentle pandarus
 from cupid's shoulder pluck his painted wings
 and fly with me to cressid
pandarus walk here i the orchard i'll bring her straight
 exit
troilus i am giddy expectation whirls me round
 the imaginary relish is so sweet
 that it enchants my sense what will it be
 when that the watery palate tastes indeed
 love's thrice repured nectar death i fear me
 swooning destruction or some joy too fine
 too subtlepotent tuned too sharp in sweetness
 for the capacity of my ruder powers
 i fear it much and i do fear besides
 that i shall lose distinction in my joys
 as doth a battle when they charge on heaps
 the enemy flying
 reenter pandarus
pandarus she's making her ready she'll come straight you
 must be witty now she does so blush and fetches
 her wind so short as if she were frayed with a
 sprite i'll fetch her it is the prettiest
 villain she fetches her breath as short as a
 newta'en sparrow
 exit
troilus even such a passion doth embrace my bosom
 my heart beats thicker than a feverous pulse
 and all my powers do their bestowing lose
 like vassalage at unawares encountering
 the eye of majesty
 reenter pandarus with cressida
pandarus come come what need you blush shame's a baby
 here she is now swear the oaths now to her that
 you have sworn to me what are you gone again
 you must be watched ere you be made tame must you
 come your ways come your ways an you draw backward
 we'll put you i the fills why do you not speak to
 her come draw this curtain and let's see your
 picture alas the day how loath you are to offend
 daylight an twere dark you'ld close sooner
 so so rub on and kiss the mistress how now
 a kiss in feefarm build there carpenter the air
 is sweet nay you shall fight your hearts out ere
 i part you the falcon as the tercel for all the
 ducks i the river go to go to
troilus you have bereft me of all words lady
pandarus words pay no debts give her deeds but she'll
 bereave you o the deeds too if she call your
 activity in question what billing again here's
 in witness whereof the parties interchangeably'
 come in come in i'll go get a fire
