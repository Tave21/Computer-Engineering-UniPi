1chr157 of the sons of gershom joel the chief and his brethren an hundred and thirty
1chr158 of the sons of elizaphan shemaiah the chief and his brethren two hundred
1chr159 of the sons of hebron eliel the chief and his brethren fourscore
1chr1510 of the sons of uzziel amminadab the chief and his brethren an hundred and twelve
1chr1511 and david called for zadok and abiathar the priests and for the levites for uriel asaiah and joel shemaiah and eliel and amminadab
1chr1512 and said unto them ye are the chief of the fathers of the levites sanctify yourselves both ye and your brethren that ye may bring up the ark of the lord god of israel unto the place that i have prepared for it
1chr1513 for because ye did it not at the first the lord our god made a breach upon us for that we sought him not after the due order
1chr1514 so the priests and the levites sanctified themselves to bring up the ark of the lord god of israel
1chr1515 and the children of the levites bare the ark of god upon their shoulders with the staves thereon as moses commanded according to the word of the lord
1chr1516 and david spake to the chief of the levites to appoint their brethren to be the singers with instruments of musick psalteries and harps and cymbals sounding by lifting up the voice with joy
1chr1517 so the levites appointed heman the son of joel and of his brethren asaph the son of berechiah and of the sons of merari their brethren ethan the son of kushaiah
1chr1518 and with them their brethren of the second degree zechariah ben and jaaziel and shemiramoth and jehiel and unni eliab and benaiah and maaseiah and mattithiah and elipheleh and mikneiah and obededom and jeiel the porters
1chr1519 so the singers heman asaph and ethan were appointed to sound with cymbals of brass
1chr1520 and zechariah and aziel and shemiramoth and jehiel and unni and eliab and maaseiah and benaiah with psalteries on alamoth
1chr1521 and mattithiah and elipheleh and mikneiah and obededom and jeiel and azaziah with harps on the sheminith to excel
1chr1522 and chenaniah chief of the levites was for song he instructed about the song because he was skilful
1chr1523 and berechiah and elkanah were doorkeepers for the ark
1chr1524 and shebaniah and jehoshaphat and nethaneel and amasai and zechariah and benaiah and eliezer the priests did blow with the trumpets before the ark of god and obededom and jehiah were doorkeepers for the ark
1chr1525 so david and the elders of israel and the captains over thousands went to bring up the ark of the covenant of the lord out of the house of obededom with joy
1chr1526 and it came to pass when god helped the levites that bare the ark of the covenant of the lord that they offered seven bullocks and seven rams
1chr1527 and david was clothed with a robe of fine linen and all the levites that bare the ark and the singers and chenaniah the master of the song with the singers david also had upon him an ephod of linen
1chr1528 thus all israel brought up the ark of the covenant of the lord with shouting and with sound of the cornet and with trumpets and with cymbals making a noise with psalteries and harps
1chr1529 and it came to pass as the ark of the covenant of the lord came to the city of david that michal the daughter of saul looking out at a window saw king david dancing and playing and she despised him in her heart
1chr161 so they brought the ark of god and set it in the midst of the tent that david had pitched for it and they offered burnt sacrifices and peace offerings before god
1chr162 and when david had made an end of offering the burnt offerings and the peace offerings he blessed the people in the name of the lord
1chr163 and he dealt to every one of israel both man and woman to every one a loaf of bread and a good piece of flesh and a flagon of wine
1chr164 and he appointed certain of the levites to minister before the ark of the lord and to record and to thank and praise the lord god of israel
1chr165 asaph the chief and next to him zechariah jeiel and shemiramoth and jehiel and mattithiah and eliab and benaiah and obededom and jeiel with psalteries and with harps but asaph made a sound with cymbals
1chr166 benaiah also and jahaziel the priests with trumpets continually before the ark of the covenant of god
1chr167 then on that day david delivered first this psalm to thank the lord into the hand of asaph and his brethren
1chr168 give thanks unto the lord call upon his name make known his deeds among the people
1chr169 sing unto him sing psalms unto him talk ye of all his wondrous works
1chr1610 glory ye in his holy name let the heart of them rejoice that seek the lord
1chr1611 seek the lord and his strength seek his face continually
1chr1612 remember his marvellous works that he hath done his wonders and the judgments of his mouth
1chr1613 o ye seed of israel his servant ye children of jacob his chosen ones
1chr1614 he is the lord our god his judgments are in all the earth
1chr1615 be ye mindful always of his covenant the word which he commanded to a thousand generations
1chr1616 even of the covenant which he made with abraham and of his oath unto isaac
1chr1617 and hath confirmed the same to jacob for a law and to israel for an everlasting covenant
1chr1618 saying unto thee will i give the land of canaan the lot of your inheritance
1chr1619 when ye were but few even a few and strangers in it
1chr1620 and when they went from nation to nation and from one kingdom to another people
1chr1621 he suffered no man to do them wrong yea he reproved kings for their sakes
1chr1622 saying touch not mine anointed and do my prophets no harm
1chr1623 sing unto the lord all the earth shew forth from day to day his salvation
1chr1624 declare his glory among the heathen his marvellous works among all nations
1chr1625 for great is the lord and greatly to be praised he also is to be feared above all gods
1chr1626 for all the gods of the people are idols but the lord made the heavens
1chr1627 glory and honour are in his presence strength and gladness are in his place
1chr1628 give unto the lord ye kindreds of the people give unto the lord glory and strength
1chr1629 give unto the lord the glory due unto his name bring an offering and come before him worship the lord in the beauty of holiness
1chr1630 fear before him all the earth the world also shall be stable that it be not moved
1chr1631 let the heavens be glad and let the earth rejoice and let men say among the nations the lord reigneth
1chr1632 let the sea roar and the fulness thereof let the fields rejoice and all that is therein
1chr1633 then shall the trees of the wood sing out at the presence of the lord because he cometh to judge the earth
1chr1634 o give thanks unto the lord for he is good for his mercy endureth for ever
1chr1635 and say ye save us o god of our salvation and gather us together and deliver us from the heathen that we may give thanks to thy holy name and glory in thy praise
1chr1636 blessed be the lord god of israel for ever and ever and all the people said amen and praised the lord
1chr1637 so he left there before the ark of the covenant of the lord asaph and his brethren to minister before the ark continually as every day's work required
1chr1638 and obededom with their brethren threescore and eight obededom also the son of jeduthun and hosah to be porters
1chr1639 and zadok the priest and his brethren the priests before the tabernacle of the lord in the high place that was at gibeon
1chr1640 to offer burnt offerings unto the lord upon the altar of the burnt offering continually morning and evening and to do according to all that is written in the law of the lord which he commanded israel
1chr1641 and with them heman and jeduthun and the rest that were chosen who were expressed by name to give thanks to the lord because his mercy endureth for ever
1chr1642 and with them heman and jeduthun with trumpets and cymbals for those that should make a sound and with musical instruments of god and the sons of jeduthun were porters
1chr1643 and all the people departed every man to his house and david returned to bless his house
1chr171 now it came to pass as david sat in his house that david said to nathan the prophet lo i dwell in an house of cedars but the ark of the covenant of the lord remaineth under curtains
1chr172 then nathan said unto david do all that is in thine heart for god is with thee
1chr173 and it came to pass the same night that the word of god came to nathan saying
1chr174 go and tell david my servant thus saith the lord thou shalt not build me an house to dwell in
1chr175 for i have not dwelt in an house since the day that i brought up israel unto this day but have gone from tent to tent and from one tabernacle to another
1chr176 wheresoever i have walked with all israel spake i a word to any of the judges of israel whom i commanded to feed my people saying why have ye not built me an house of cedars
1chr177 now therefore thus shalt thou say unto my servant david thus saith the lord of hosts i took thee from the sheepcote even from following the sheep that thou shouldest be ruler over my people israel
1chr178 and i have been with thee whithersoever thou hast walked and have cut off all thine enemies from before thee and have made thee a name like the name of the great men that are in the earth
1chr179 also i will ordain a place for my people israel and will plant them and they shall dwell in their place and shall be moved no more neither shall the children of wickedness waste them any more as at the beginning
1chr1710 and since the time that i commanded judges to be over my people israel moreover i will subdue all thine enemies furthermore i tell thee that the lord will build thee an house
1chr1711 and it shall come to pass when thy days be expired that thou must go to be with thy fathers that i will raise up thy seed after thee which shall be of thy sons and i will establish his kingdom
1chr1712 he shall build me an house and i will stablish his throne for ever
1chr1713 i will be his father and he shall be my son and i will not take my mercy away from him as i took it from him that was before thee
1chr1714 but i will settle him in mine house and in my kingdom for ever and his throne shall be established for evermore
1chr1715 according to all these words and according to all this vision so did nathan speak unto david
1chr1716 and david the king came and sat before the lord and said who am i o lord god and what is mine house that thou hast brought me hitherto
1chr1717 and yet this was a small thing in thine eyes o god for thou hast also spoken of thy servant's house for a great while to come and hast regarded me according to the estate of a man of high degree o lord god
1chr1718 what can david speak more to thee for the honour of thy servant for thou knowest thy servant
1chr1719 o lord for thy servant's sake and according to thine own heart hast thou done all this greatness in making known all these great things
1chr1720 o lord there is none like thee neither is there any god beside thee according to all that we have heard with our ears
1chr1721 and what one nation in the earth is like thy people israel whom god went to redeem to be his own people to make thee a name of greatness and terribleness by driving out nations from before thy people whom thou hast redeemed out of egypt
1chr1722 for thy people israel didst thou make thine own people for ever and thou lord becamest their god
1chr1723 therefore now lord let the thing that thou hast spoken concerning thy servant and concerning his house be established for ever and do as thou hast said
1chr1724 let it even be established that thy name may be magnified for ever saying the lord of hosts is the god of israel even a god to israel and let the house of david thy servant be established before thee
1chr1725 for thou o my god hast told thy servant that thou wilt build him an house therefore thy servant hath found in his heart to pray before thee
1chr1726 and now lord thou art god and hast promised this goodness unto thy servant
1chr1727 now therefore let it please thee to bless the house of thy servant that it may be before thee for ever for thou blessest o lord and it shall be blessed for ever
1chr181 now after this it came to pass that david smote the philistines and subdued them and took gath and her towns out of the hand of the philistines
1chr182 and he smote moab and the moabites became david's servants and brought gifts
1chr183 and david smote hadarezer king of zobah unto hamath as he went to stablish his dominion by the river euphrates
1chr184 and david took from him a thousand chariots and seven thousand horsemen and twenty thousand footmen david also houghed all the chariot horses but reserved of them an hundred chariots
1chr185 and when the syrians of damascus came to help hadarezer king of zobah david slew of the syrians two and twenty thousand men
1chr186 then david put garrisons in syriadamascus and the syrians became david's servants and brought gifts thus the lord preserved david whithersoever he went
1chr187 and david took the shields of gold that were on the servants of hadarezer and brought them to jerusalem
1chr188 likewise from tibhath and from chun cities of hadarezer brought david very much brass wherewith solomon made the brasen sea and the pillars and the vessels of brass
1chr189 now when tou king of hamath heard how david had smitten all the host of hadarezer king of zobah
1chr1810 he sent hadoram his son to king david to enquire of his welfare and to congratulate him because he had fought against hadarezer and smitten him for hadarezer had war with tou and with him all manner of vessels of gold and silver and brass
1chr1811 them also king david dedicated unto the lord with the silver and the gold that he brought from all these nations from edom and from moab and from the children of ammon and from the philistines and from amalek
1chr1812 moreover abishai the son of zeruiah slew of the edomites in the valley of salt eighteen thousand
1chr1813 and he put garrisons in edom and all the edomites became david's servants thus the lord preserved david whithersoever he went
1chr1814 so david reigned over all israel and executed judgment and justice among all his people
1chr1815 and joab the son of zeruiah was over the host and jehoshaphat the son of ahilud recorder
1chr1816 and zadok the son of ahitub and abimelech the son of abiathar were the priests and shavsha was scribe
1chr1817 and benaiah the son of jehoiada was over the cherethites and the pelethites and the sons of david were chief about the king
1chr191 now it came to pass after this that nahash the king of the children of ammon died and his son reigned in his stead
1chr192 and david said i will shew kindness unto hanun the son of nahash because his father shewed kindness to me and david sent messengers to comfort him concerning his father so the servants of david came into the land of the children of ammon to hanun to comfort him
1chr193 but the princes of the children of ammon said to hanun thinkest thou that david doth honour thy father that he hath sent comforters unto thee are not his servants come unto thee for to search and to overthrow and to spy out the land
1chr194 wherefore hanun took david's servants and shaved them and cut off their garments in the midst hard by their buttocks and sent them away
1chr195 then there went certain and told david how the men were served and he sent to meet them for the men were greatly ashamed and the king said tarry at jericho until your beards be grown and then return
1chr196 and when the children of ammon saw that they had made themselves odious to david hanun and the children of ammon sent a thousand talents of silver to hire them chariots and horsemen out of mesopotamia and out of syriamaachah and out of zobah
1chr197 so they hired thirty and two thousand chariots and the king of maachah and his people who came and pitched before medeba and the children of ammon gathered themselves together from their cities and came to battle
1chr198 and when david heard of it he sent joab and all the host of the mighty men
1chr199 and the children of ammon came out and put the battle in array before the gate of the city and the kings that were come were by themselves in the field
1chr1910 now when joab saw that the battle was set against him before and behind he chose out of all the choice of israel and put them in array against the syrians
1chr1911 and the rest of the people he delivered unto the hand of abishai his brother and they set themselves in array against the children of ammon
1chr1912 and he said if the syrians be too strong for me then thou shalt help me but if the children of ammon be too strong for thee then i will help thee
1chr1913 be of good courage and let us behave ourselves valiantly for our people and for the cities of our god and let the lord do that which is good in his sight
1chr1914 so joab and the people that were with him drew nigh before the syrians unto the battle and they fled before him
1chr1915 and when the children of ammon saw that the syrians were fled they likewise fled before abishai his brother and entered into the city then joab came to jerusalem
1chr1916 and when the syrians saw that they were put to the worse before israel they sent messengers and drew forth the syrians that were beyond the river and shophach the captain of the host of hadarezer went before them
1chr1917 and it was told david and he gathered all israel and passed over jordan and came upon them and set the battle in array against them so when david had put the battle in array against the syrians they fought with him
1chr1918 but the syrians fled before israel and david slew of the syrians seven thousand men which fought in chariots and forty thousand footmen and killed shophach the captain of the host
1chr1919 and when the servants of hadarezer saw that they were put to the worse before israel they made peace with david and became his servants neither would the syrians help the children of ammon any more
1chr201 and it came to pass that after the year was expired at the time that kings go out to battle joab led forth the power of the army and wasted the country of the children of ammon and came and besieged rabbah but david tarried at jerusalem and joab smote rabbah and destroyed it
1chr202 and david took the crown of their king from off his head and found it to weigh a talent of gold and there were precious stones in it and it was set upon david's head and he brought also exceeding much spoil out of the city
1chr203 and he brought out the people that were in it and cut them with saws and with harrows of iron and with axes even so dealt david with all the cities of the children of ammon and david and all the people returned to jerusalem
1chr204 and it came to pass after this that there arose war at gezer with the philistines at which time sibbechai the hushathite slew sippai that was of the children of the giant and they were subdued
1chr205 and there was war again with the philistines and elhanan the son of jair slew lahmi the brother of goliath the gittite whose spear staff was like a weaver's beam
1chr206 and yet again there was war at gath where was a man of great stature whose fingers and toes were four and twenty six on each hand and six on each foot and he also was the son of the giant
1chr207 but when he defied israel jonathan the son of shimea david's brother slew him
1chr208 these were born unto the giant in gath and they fell by the hand of david and by the hand of his servants
1chr211 and satan stood up against israel and provoked david to number israel
1chr212 and david said to joab and to the rulers of the people go number israel from beersheba even to dan and bring the number of them to me that i may know it
1chr213 and joab answered the lord make his people an hundred times so many more as they be but my lord the king are they not all my lord's servants why then doth my lord require this thing why will he be a cause of trespass to israel
1chr214 nevertheless the king's word prevailed against joab wherefore joab departed and went throughout all israel and came to jerusalem
1chr215 and joab gave the sum of the number of the people unto david and all they of israel were a thousand thousand and an hundred thousand men that drew sword and judah was four hundred threescore and ten thousand men that drew sword
1chr216 but levi and benjamin counted he not among them for the king's word was abominable to joab
1chr217 and god was displeased with this thing therefore he smote israel
1chr218 and david said unto god i have sinned greatly because i have done this thing but now i beseech thee do away the iniquity of thy servant for i have done very foolishly
1chr219 and the lord spake unto gad david's seer saying
1chr2110 go and tell david saying thus saith the lord i offer thee three things choose thee one of them that i may do it unto thee
1chr2111 so gad came to david and said unto him thus saith the lord choose thee
1chr2112 either three years famine or three months to be destroyed before thy foes while that the sword of thine enemies overtaketh thee or else three days the sword of the lord even the pestilence in the land and the angel of the lord destroying throughout all the coasts of israel now therefore advise thyself what word i shall bring again to him that sent me
1chr2113 and david said unto gad i am in a great strait let me fall now into the hand of the lord for very great are his mercies but let me not fall into the hand of man
1chr2114 so the lord sent pestilence upon israel and there fell of israel seventy thousand men
1chr2115 and god sent an angel unto jerusalem to destroy it and as he was destroying the lord beheld and he repented him of the evil and said to the angel that destroyed it is enough stay now thine hand and the angel of the lord stood by the threshingfloor of ornan the jebusite
1chr2116 and david lifted up his eyes and saw the angel of the lord stand between the earth and the heaven having a drawn sword in his hand stretched out over jerusalem then david and the elders of israel who were clothed in sackcloth fell upon their faces
1chr2117 and david said unto god is it not i that commanded the people to be numbered even i it is that have sinned and done evil indeed but as for these sheep what have they done let thine hand i pray thee o lord my god be on me and on my father's house but not on thy people that they should be plagued
1chr2118 then the angel of the lord commanded gad to say to david that david should go up and set up an altar unto the lord in the threshingfloor of ornan the jebusite
1chr2119 and david went up at the saying of gad which he spake in the name of the lord
1chr2120 and ornan turned back and saw the angel and his four sons with him hid themselves now ornan was threshing wheat
1chr2121 and as david came to ornan ornan looked and saw david and went out of the threshingfloor and bowed himself to david with his face to the ground
1chr2122 then david said to ornan grant me the place of this threshingfloor that i may build an altar therein unto the lord thou shalt grant it me for the full price that the plague may be stayed from the people
1chr2123 and ornan said unto david take it to thee and let my lord the king do that which is good in his eyes lo i give thee the oxen also for burnt offerings and the threshing instruments for wood and the wheat for the meat offering i give it all
1chr2124 and king david said to ornan nay but i will verily buy it for the full price for i will not take that which is thine for the lord nor offer burnt offerings without cost
1chr2125 so david gave to ornan for the place six hundred shekels of gold by weight
1chr2126 and david built there an altar unto the lord and offered burnt offerings and peace offerings and called upon the lord and he answered him from heaven by fire upon the altar of burnt offering
1chr2127 and the lord commanded the angel and he put up his sword again into the sheath thereof
1chr2128 at that time when david saw that the lord had answered him in the threshingfloor of ornan the jebusite then he sacrificed there
1chr2129 for the tabernacle of the lord which moses made in the wilderness and the altar of the burnt offering were at that season in the high place at gibeon
1chr2130 but david could not go before it to enquire of god for he was afraid because of the sword of the angel of the lord
1chr221 then david said this is the house of the lord god and this is the altar of the burnt offering for israel
1chr222 and david commanded to gather together the strangers that were in the land of israel and he set masons to hew wrought stones to build the house of god
1chr223 and david prepared iron in abundance for the nails for the doors of the gates and for the joinings and brass in abundance without weight
1chr224 also cedar trees in abundance for the zidonians and they of tyre brought much cedar wood to david
1chr225 and david said solomon my son is young and tender and the house that is to be builded for the lord must be exceeding magnifical of fame and of glory throughout all countries i will therefore now make preparation for it so david prepared abundantly before his death
1chr226 then he called for solomon his son and charged him to build an house for the lord god of israel
1chr227 and david said to solomon my son as for me it was in my mind to build an house unto the name of the lord my god
1chr228 but the word of the lord came to me saying thou hast shed blood abundantly and hast made great wars thou shalt not build an house unto my name because thou hast shed much blood upon the earth in my sight
1chr229 behold a son shall be born to thee who shall be a man of rest and i will give him rest from all his enemies round about for his name shall be solomon and i will give peace and quietness unto israel in his days
1chr2210 he shall build an house for my name and he shall be my son and i will be his father and i will establish the throne of his kingdom over israel for ever
1chr2211 now my son the lord be with thee and prosper thou and build the house of the lord thy god as he hath said of thee
1chr2212 only the lord give thee wisdom and understanding and give thee charge concerning israel that thou mayest keep the law of the lord thy god
1chr2213 then shalt thou prosper if thou takest heed to fulfil the statutes and judgments which the lord charged moses with concerning israel be strong and of good courage dread not nor be dismayed
1chr2214 now behold in my trouble i have prepared for the house of the lord an hundred thousand talents of gold and a thousand thousand talents of silver and of brass and iron without weight for it is in abundance timber also and stone have i prepared and thou mayest add thereto
1chr2215 moreover there are workmen with thee in abundance hewers and workers of stone and timber and all manner of cunning men for every manner of work
1chr2216 of the gold the silver and the brass and the iron there is no number arise therefore and be doing and the lord be with thee
1chr2217 david also commanded all the princes of israel to help solomon his son saying
1chr2218 is not the lord your god with you and hath he not given you rest on every side for he hath given the inhabitants of the land into mine hand and the land is subdued before the lord and before his people
1chr2219 now set your heart and your soul to seek the lord your god arise therefore and build ye the sanctuary of the lord god to bring the ark of the covenant of the lord and the holy vessels of god into the house that is to be built to the name of the lord
1chr231 so when david was old and full of days he made solomon his son king over israel
1chr232 and he gathered together all the princes of israel with the priests and the levites
1chr233 now the levites were numbered from the age of thirty years and upward and their number by their polls man by man was thirty and eight thousand
1chr234 of which twenty and four thousand were to set forward the work of the house of the lord and six thousand were officers and judges
1chr235 moreover four thousand were porters and four thousand praised the lord with the instruments which i made said david to praise therewith
1chr236 and david divided them into courses among the sons of levi namely gershon kohath and merari
1chr237 of the gershonites were laadan and shimei
1chr238 the sons of laadan the chief was jehiel and zetham and joel three
1chr239 the sons of shimei shelomith and haziel and haran three these were the chief of the fathers of laadan
1chr2310 and the sons of shimei were jahath zina and jeush and beriah these four were the sons of shimei
1chr2311 and jahath was the chief and zizah the second but jeush and beriah had not many sons therefore they were in one reckoning according to their father's house
1chr2312 the sons of kohath amram izhar hebron and uzziel four
1chr2313 the sons of amram aaron and moses and aaron was separated that he should sanctify the most holy things he and his sons for ever to burn incense before the lord to minister unto him and to bless in his name for ever
1chr2314 now concerning moses the man of god his sons were named of the tribe of levi
