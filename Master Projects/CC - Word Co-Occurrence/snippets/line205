 but as we often see against some storm
 a silence in the heavens the rack stand still
 the bold winds speechless and the orb below
 as hush as death anon the dreadful thunder
 doth rend the region so after pyrrhus pause
 aroused vengeance sets him new awork
 and never did the cyclops hammers fall
 on mars's armour forged for proof eterne
 with less remorse than pyrrhus bleeding sword
 now falls on priam
 out out thou strumpet fortune all you gods
 in general synod take away her power
 break all the spokes and fellies from her wheel
 and bowl the round nave down the hill of heaven
 as low as to the fiends'
lord polonius this is too long
hamlet it shall to the barber's with your beard prithee
 say on he's for a jig or a tale of bawdry or he
 sleeps say on come to hecuba
first player but who o who had seen the mobled queen'
hamlet the mobled queen'
lord polonius that's good mobled queen is good
first player run barefoot up and down threatening the flames
 with bisson rheum a clout upon that head
 where late the diadem stood and for a robe
 about her lank and all o'erteemed loins
 a blanket in the alarm of fear caught up
 who this had seen with tongue in venom steep'd
 gainst fortune's state would treason have
 pronounced
 but if the gods themselves did see her then
 when she saw pyrrhus make malicious sport
 in mincing with his sword her husband's limbs
 the instant burst of clamour that she made
 unless things mortal move them not at all
 would have made milch the burning eyes of heaven
 and passion in the gods'
lord polonius look whether he has not turned his colour and has
 tears in's eyes pray you no more
hamlet tis well i'll have thee speak out the rest soon
 good my lord will you see the players well
 bestowed do you hear let them be well used for
 they are the abstract and brief chronicles of the
 time after your death you were better have a bad
 epitaph than their ill report while you live
lord polonius my lord i will use them according to their desert
hamlet god's bodykins man much better use every man
 after his desert and who should scape whipping
 use them after your own honour and dignity the less
 they deserve the more merit is in your bounty
 take them in
lord polonius come sirs

 exit polonius with all the players but the first
 dost thou hear me old friend can you play the
 murder of gonzago
first player ay my lord

 study a speech of some dozen or sixteen lines which
 i would set down and insert in't could you not

 welcome to elsinore
rosencrantz good my lord
hamlet ay so god be wi ye
 exeunt rosencrantz and guildenstern
 now i am alone
 o what a rogue and peasant slave am i
 is it not monstrous that this player here
 but in a fiction in a dream of passion
 could force his soul so to his own conceit
 that from her working all his visage wann'd
 tears in his eyes distraction in's aspect
 a broken voice and his whole function suiting
 with forms to his conceit and all for nothing
 for hecuba
 what's hecuba to him or he to hecuba
 that he should weep for her what would he do
 had he the motive and the cue for passion
 that i have he would drown the stage with tears
 and cleave the general ear with horrid speech
 make mad the guilty and appal the free
 confound the ignorant and amaze indeed
 the very faculties of eyes and ears yet i
 a dull and muddymettled rascal peak
 like johnadreams unpregnant of my cause
 and can say nothing no not for a king
 upon whose property and most dear life
 a damn'd defeat was made am i a coward
 who calls me villain breaks my pate across
 plucks off my beard and blows it in my face
 tweaks me by the nose gives me the lie i the throat
 as deep as to the lungs who does me this
 ha
 swounds i should take it for it cannot be
 but i am pigeonliver'd and lack gall
 to make oppression bitter or ere this
 i should have fatted all the region kites
 with this slave's offal bloody bawdy villain
 remorseless treacherous lecherous kindless villain
 o vengeance
 why what an ass am i this is most brave
 that i the son of a dear father murder'd
 prompted to my revenge by heaven and hell
 must like a whore unpack my heart with words
 and fall acursing like a very drab
 a scullion
 fie upon't foh about my brain i have heard
 that guilty creatures sitting at a play
 have by the very cunning of the scene
 been struck so to the soul that presently
 they have proclaim'd their malefactions
 for murder though it have no tongue will speak
 with most miraculous organ i'll have these players
 play something like the murder of my father
 before mine uncle i'll observe his looks
 i'll tent him to the quick if he but blench
 i know my course the spirit that i have seen
 may be the devil and the devil hath power
 to assume a pleasing shape yea and perhaps
 out of my weakness and my melancholy
 as he is very potent with such spirits
 abuses me to damn me i'll have grounds
 more relative than this the play s the thing
 wherein i'll catch the conscience of the king

 hamlet
act iii
scene i a room in the castle
 enter king claudius queen gertrude polonius
 ophelia rosencrantz and guildenstern
king claudius and can you by no drift of circumstance
 get from him why he puts on this confusion
 grating so harshly all his days of quiet
 with turbulent and dangerous lunacy
rosencrantz he does confess he feels himself distracted
 but from what cause he will by no means speak
guildenstern nor do we find him forward to be sounded
 but with a crafty madness keeps aloof
 when we would bring him on to some confession
 of his true state
queen gertrude did he receive you well
rosencrantz most like a gentleman
guildenstern but with much forcing of his disposition
rosencrantz niggard of question but of our demands
 most free in his reply
queen gertrude did you assay him
 to any pastime
rosencrantz madam it so fell out that certain players
 we o'erraught on the way of these we told him
 and there did seem in him a kind of joy
 to hear of it they are about the court
 and as i think they have already order
 this night to play before him
lord polonius tis most true
 and he beseech'd me to entreat your majesties
 to hear and see the matter
king claudius with all my heart and it doth much content me
 to hear him so inclined
 good gentlemen give him a further edge
 and drive his purpose on to these delights
rosencrantz we shall my lord
 exeunt rosencrantz and guildenstern
king claudius sweet gertrude leave us too
 for we have closely sent for hamlet hither
 that he as twere by accident may here
 affront ophelia
 her father and myself lawful espials
 will so bestow ourselves that seeing unseen
 we may of their encounter frankly judge
 and gather by him as he is behaved
 if t be the affliction of his love or no
 that thus he suffers for
queen gertrude i shall obey you
 and for your part ophelia i do wish
 that your good beauties be the happy cause
 of hamlet's wildness so shall i hope your virtues
 will bring him to his wonted way again
 to both your honours
ophelia madam i wish it may
 exit queen gertrude
lord polonius ophelia walk you here gracious so please you
 we will bestow ourselves
 to ophelia
 read on this book
 that show of such an exercise may colour
 your loneliness we are oft to blame in this
 tis too much provedthat with devotion's visage
 and pious action we do sugar o'er
 the devil himself
king claudius aside o tis too true
 how smart a lash that speech doth give my conscience
 the harlot's cheek beautied with plastering art
 is not more ugly to the thing that helps it
 than is my deed to my most painted word
 o heavy burthen
lord polonius i hear him coming let's withdraw my lord
