make answer muse wilt thou not haply say
'truth needs no colour with his colour fix'd
beauty no pencil beauty's truth to lay
but best is best if never intermix'd'
because he needs no praise wilt thou be dumb
excuse not silence so for't lies in thee
to make him much outlive a gilded tomb
and to be praised of ages yet to be
 then do thy office muse i teach thee how
 to make him seem long hence as he shows now
cii
my love is strengthen'd though more weak in seeming
i love not less though less the show appear
that love is merchandized whose rich esteeming
the owner's tongue doth publish every where
our love was new and then but in the spring
when i was wont to greet it with my lays
as philomel in summer's front doth sing
and stops her pipe in growth of riper days
not that the summer is less pleasant now
than when her mournful hymns did hush the night
but that wild music burthens every bough
and sweets grown common lose their dear delight
 therefore like her i sometime hold my tongue
 because i would not dull you with my song
ciii
alack what poverty my muse brings forth
that having such a scope to show her pride
the argument all bare is of more worth
than when it hath my added praise beside
o blame me not if i no more can write
look in your glass and there appears a face
that overgoes my blunt invention quite
dulling my lines and doing me disgrace
were it not sinful then striving to mend
to mar the subject that before was well
for to no other pass my verses tend
than of your graces and your gifts to tell
 and more much more than in my verse can sit
 your own glass shows you when you look in it
civ
to me fair friend you never can be old
for as you were when first your eye i eyed
such seems your beauty still three winters cold
have from the forests shook three summers pride
three beauteous springs to yellow autumn turn'd
in process of the seasons have i seen
three april perfumes in three hot junes burn'd
since first i saw you fresh which yet are green
ah yet doth beauty like a dialhand
steal from his figure and no pace perceived
so your sweet hue which methinks still doth stand
hath motion and mine eye may be deceived
 for fear of which hear this thou age unbred
 ere you were born was beauty's summer dead
cv
let not my love be call'd idolatry
nor my beloved as an idol show
since all alike my songs and praises be
to one of one still such and ever so
kind is my love today tomorrow kind
still constant in a wondrous excellence
therefore my verse to constancy confined
one thing expressing leaves out difference
'fair kind and true is all my argument
'fair kind and true varying to other words
and in this change is my invention spent
three themes in one which wondrous scope affords
 fair kind and true have often lived alone
 which three till now never kept seat in one
cvi
when in the chronicle of wasted time
i see descriptions of the fairest wights
and beauty making beautiful old rhyme
in praise of ladies dead and lovely knights
then in the blazon of sweet beauty's best
of hand of foot of lip of eye of brow
i see their antique pen would have express'd
even such a beauty as you master now
so all their praises are but prophecies
of this our time all you prefiguring
and for they look'd but with divining eyes
they had not skill enough your worth to sing
 for we which now behold these present days
 had eyes to wonder but lack tongues to praise
cvii
not mine own fears nor the prophetic soul
of the wide world dreaming on things to come
can yet the lease of my true love control
supposed as forfeit to a confined doom
the mortal moon hath her eclipse endured
and the sad augurs mock their own presage
incertainties now crown themselves assured
and peace proclaims olives of endless age
now with the drops of this most balmy time
my love looks fresh and death to me subscribes
since spite of him i'll live in this poor rhyme
while he insults o'er dull and speechless tribes
 and thou in this shalt find thy monument
 when tyrants crests and tombs of brass are spent
cviii
what's in the brain that ink may character
which hath not figured to thee my true spirit
what's new to speak what new to register
that may express my love or thy dear merit
nothing sweet boy but yet like prayers divine
i must each day say o'er the very same
counting no old thing old thou mine i thine
even as when first i hallow'd thy fair name
so that eternal love in love's fresh case
weighs not the dust and injury of age
nor gives to necessary wrinkles place
but makes antiquity for aye his page
 finding the first conceit of love there bred
 where time and outward form would show it dead
cix
o never say that i was false of heart
though absence seem'd my flame to qualify
as easy might i from myself depart
as from my soul which in thy breast doth lie
that is my home of love if i have ranged
like him that travels i return again
just to the time not with the time exchanged
so that myself bring water for my stain
never believe though in my nature reign'd
all frailties that besiege all kinds of blood
that it could so preposterously be stain'd
to leave for nothing all thy sum of good
 for nothing this wide universe i call
 save thou my rose in it thou art my all
cx
alas tis true i have gone here and there
and made myself a motley to the view
gored mine own thoughts sold cheap what is most dear
made old offences of affections new
most true it is that i have look'd on truth
askance and strangely but by all above
these blenches gave my heart another youth
and worse essays proved thee my best of love
now all is done have what shall have no end
mine appetite i never more will grind
on newer proof to try an older friend
a god in love to whom i am confined
 then give me welcome next my heaven the best
 even to thy pure and most most loving breast
cxi
o for my sake do you with fortune chide
the guilty goddess of my harmful deeds
that did not better for my life provide
than public means which public manners breeds
thence comes it that my name receives a brand
and almost thence my nature is subdued
to what it works in like the dyer's hand
pity me then and wish i were renew'd
whilst like a willing patient i will drink
potions of eisel gainst my strong infection
no bitterness that i will bitter think
nor double penance to correct correction
 pity me then dear friend and i assure ye
 even that your pity is enough to cure me
cxii
your love and pity doth the impression fill
which vulgar scandal stamp'd upon my brow
for what care i who calls me well or ill
so you o'ergreen my bad my good allow
you are my all the world and i must strive
to know my shames and praises from your tongue
none else to me nor i to none alive
that my steel'd sense or changes right or wrong
in so profound abysm i throw all care
of others voices that my adder's sense
to critic and to flatterer stopped are
mark how with my neglect i do dispense
 you are so strongly in my purpose bred
 that all the world besides methinks are dead
cxiii
since i left you mine eye is in my mind
and that which governs me to go about
doth part his function and is partly blind
seems seeing but effectually is out
for it no form delivers to the heart
of bird of flower or shape which it doth latch
of his quick objects hath the mind no part
nor his own vision holds what it doth catch
for if it see the rudest or gentlest sight
the most sweet favour or deformed'st creature
the mountain or the sea the day or night
the crow or dove it shapes them to your feature
 incapable of more replete with you
 my most true mind thus makes mine eye untrue
cxiv
or whether doth my mind being crown'd with you
drink up the monarch's plague this flattery
or whether shall i say mine eye saith true
and that your love taught it this alchemy
to make of monsters and things indigest
such cherubins as your sweet self resemble
creating every bad a perfect best
as fast as objects to his beams assemble
o'tis the first tis flattery in my seeing
