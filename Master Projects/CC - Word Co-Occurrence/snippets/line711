 duke of burgundy and his train
king henry v peace to this meeting wherefore we are met
 unto our brother france and to our sister
 health and fair time of day joy and good wishes
 to our most fair and princely cousin katharine
 and as a branch and member of this royalty
 by whom this great assembly is contrived
 we do salute you duke of burgundy
 and princes french and peers health to you all
king of france right joyous are we to behold your face
 most worthy brother england fairly met
 so are you princes english every one
queen isabel so happy be the issue brother england
 of this good day and of this gracious meeting
 as we are now glad to behold your eyes
 your eyes which hitherto have borne in them
 against the french that met them in their bent
 the fatal balls of murdering basilisks
 the venom of such looks we fairly hope
 have lost their quality and that this day
 shall change all griefs and quarrels into love
king henry v to cry amen to that thus we appear
queen isabel you english princes all i do salute you
burgundy my duty to you both on equal love
 great kings of france and england that i have labour'd
 with all my wits my pains and strong endeavours
 to bring your most imperial majesties
 unto this bar and royal interview
 your mightiness on both parts best can witness
 since then my office hath so far prevail'd
 that face to face and royal eye to eye
 you have congreeted let it not disgrace me
 if i demand before this royal view
 what rub or what impediment there is
 why that the naked poor and mangled peace
 dear nurse of arts and joyful births
 should not in this best garden of the world
 our fertile france put up her lovely visage
 alas she hath from france too long been chased
 and all her husbandry doth lie on heaps
 corrupting in its own fertility
 her vine the merry cheerer of the heart
 unpruned dies her hedges evenpleach'd
 like prisoners wildly overgrown with hair
 put forth disorder'd twigs her fallow leas
 the darnel hemlock and rank fumitory
 doth root upon while that the coulter rusts
 that should deracinate such savagery
 the even mead that erst brought sweetly forth
 the freckled cowslip burnet and green clover
 wanting the scythe all uncorrected rank
 conceives by idleness and nothing teems
 but hateful docks rough thistles kecksies burs
 losing both beauty and utility
 and as our vineyards fallows meads and hedges
 defective in their natures grow to wildness
 even so our houses and ourselves and children
 have lost or do not learn for want of time
 the sciences that should become our country
 but grow like savagesas soldiers will
 that nothing do but meditate on blood
 to swearing and stern looks diffused attire
 and every thing that seems unnatural
 which to reduce into our former favour
 you are assembled and my speech entreats
 that i may know the let why gentle peace
 should not expel these inconveniences
 and bless us with her former qualities
king henry v if duke of burgundy you would the peace
 whose want gives growth to the imperfections
 which you have cited you must buy that peace
 with full accord to all our just demands
 whose tenors and particular effects
 you have enscheduled briefly in your hands
burgundy the king hath heard them to the which as yet
 there is no answer made
king henry v well then the peace
 which you before so urged lies in his answer
king of france i have but with a cursorary eye
 o'erglanced the articles pleaseth your grace
 to appoint some of your council presently
 to sit with us once more with better heed
 to resurvey them we will suddenly
 pass our accept and peremptory answer
king henry v brother we shall go uncle exeter
 and brother clarence and you brother gloucester
 warwick and huntingdon go with the king
 and take with you free power to ratify
 augment or alter as your wisdoms best
 shall see advantageable for our dignity
 any thing in or out of our demands
 and we'll consign thereto will you fair sister
 go with the princes or stay here with us
queen isabel our gracious brother i will go with them
 haply a woman's voice may do some good
 when articles too nicely urged be stood on
king henry v yet leave our cousin katharine here with us
 she is our capital demand comprised
 within the forerank of our articles
queen isabel she hath good leave
 exeunt all except henry katharine and alice
king henry v fair katharine and most fair
 will you vouchsafe to teach a soldier terms
 such as will enter at a lady's ear
 and plead his lovesuit to her gentle heart
katharine your majesty shall mock at me i cannot speak your england
king henry v o fair katharine if you will love me soundly with
 your french heart i will be glad to hear you
 confess it brokenly with your english tongue do
 you like me kate
katharine pardonnezmoi i cannot tell vat is like me'
king henry v an angel is like you kate and you are like an angel
katharine que ditil que je suis semblable a les anges
alice oui vraiment sauf votre grace ainsi ditil
king henry v i said so dear katharine and i must not blush to
 affirm it
katharine o bon dieu les langues des hommes sont pleines de
 tromperies
king henry v what says she fair one that the tongues of men
 are full of deceits
alice oui dat de tongues of de mans is be full of
 deceits dat is de princess
king henry v the princess is the better englishwoman i faith
 kate my wooing is fit for thy understanding i am
 glad thou canst speak no better english for if
 thou couldst thou wouldst find me such a plain king
 that thou wouldst think i had sold my farm to buy my
 crown i know no ways to mince it in love but
 directly to say i love you then if you urge me
 farther than to say do you in faith i wear out
 my suit give me your answer i faith do and so
 clap hands and a bargain how say you lady
katharine sauf votre honneur me understand vell
king henry v marry if you would put me to verses or to dance for
 your sake kate why you undid me for the one i
 have neither words nor measure and for the other i
 have no strength in measure yet a reasonable
 measure in strength if i could win a lady at
 leapfrog or by vaulting into my saddle with my
 armour on my back under the correction of bragging
 be it spoken i should quickly leap into a wife
 or if i might buffet for my love or bound my horse
 for her favours i could lay on like a butcher and
 sit like a jackanapes never off but before god
 kate i cannot look greenly nor gasp out my
 eloquence nor i have no cunning in protestation
 only downright oaths which i never use till urged
 nor never break for urging if thou canst love a
 fellow of this temper kate whose face is not worth
 sunburning that never looks in his glass for love
 of any thing he sees there let thine eye be thy
 cook i speak to thee plain soldier if thou canst
 love me for this take me if not to say to thee
