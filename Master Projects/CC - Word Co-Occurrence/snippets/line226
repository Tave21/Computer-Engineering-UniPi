 and then we will deliver you the cause
 why i that did love caesar when i struck him
 have thus proceeded
antony i doubt not of your wisdom
 let each man render me his bloody hand
 first marcus brutus will i shake with you
 next caius cassius do i take your hand
 now decius brutus yours now yours metellus
 yours cinna and my valiant casca yours
 though last not last in love yours good trebonius
 gentlemen allalas what shall i say
 my credit now stands on such slippery ground
 that one of two bad ways you must conceit me
 either a coward or a flatterer
 that i did love thee caesar o tis true
 if then thy spirit look upon us now
 shall it not grieve thee dearer than thy death
 to see thy thy anthony making his peace
 shaking the bloody fingers of thy foes
 most noble in the presence of thy corse
 had i as many eyes as thou hast wounds
 weeping as fast as they stream forth thy blood
 it would become me better than to close
 in terms of friendship with thine enemies
 pardon me julius here wast thou bay'd brave hart
 here didst thou fall and here thy hunters stand
 sign'd in thy spoil and crimson'd in thy lethe
 o world thou wast the forest to this hart
 and this indeed o world the heart of thee
 how like a deer strucken by many princes
 dost thou here lie
cassius mark antony
antony pardon me caius cassius
 the enemies of caesar shall say this
 then in a friend it is cold modesty
cassius i blame you not for praising caesar so
 but what compact mean you to have with us
 will you be prick'd in number of our friends
 or shall we on and not depend on you
antony therefore i took your hands but was indeed
 sway'd from the point by looking down on caesar
 friends am i with you all and love you all
 upon this hope that you shall give me reasons
 why and wherein caesar was dangerous
brutus or else were this a savage spectacle
 our reasons are so full of good regard
 that were you antony the son of caesar
 you should be satisfied
antony that's all i seek
 and am moreover suitor that i may
 produce his body to the marketplace
 and in the pulpit as becomes a friend
 speak in the order of his funeral
brutus you shall mark antony
cassius brutus a word with you
 aside to brutus
 you know not what you do do not consent
 that antony speak in his funeral
 know you how much the people may be moved
 by that which he will utter
brutus by your pardon
 i will myself into the pulpit first
 and show the reason of our caesar's death
 what antony shall speak i will protest
 he speaks by leave and by permission
 and that we are contented caesar shall
 have all true rites and lawful ceremonies
 it shall advantage more than do us wrong
cassius i know not what may fall i like it not
brutus mark antony here take you caesar's body
 you shall not in your funeral speech blame us
 but speak all good you can devise of caesar
 and say you do't by our permission
 else shall you not have any hand at all
 about his funeral and you shall speak
 in the same pulpit whereto i am going
 after my speech is ended
antony be it so
 i do desire no more
brutus prepare the body then and follow us
 exeunt all but antony
antony o pardon me thou bleeding piece of earth
 that i am meek and gentle with these butchers
 thou art the ruins of the noblest man
 that ever lived in the tide of times
 woe to the hand that shed this costly blood
 over thy wounds now do i prophesy
 which like dumb mouths do ope their ruby lips
 to beg the voice and utterance of my tongue
 a curse shall light upon the limbs of men
 domestic fury and fierce civil strife
 shall cumber all the parts of italy
 blood and destruction shall be so in use
 and dreadful objects so familiar
 that mothers shall but smile when they behold
 their infants quarter'd with the hands of war
 all pity choked with custom of fell deeds
 and caesar's spirit ranging for revenge
 with ate by his side come hot from hell
 shall in these confines with a monarch's voice
 cry havoc and let slip the dogs of war
 that this foul deed shall smell above the earth
 with carrion men groaning for burial
 enter a servant
 you serve octavius caesar do you not
servant i do mark antony
antony caesar did write for him to come to rome
servant he did receive his letters and is coming
 and bid me say to you by word of mouth
 o caesar
 seeing the body
antony thy heart is big get thee apart and weep
 passion i see is catching for mine eyes
 seeing those beads of sorrow stand in thine
 began to water is thy master coming
servant he lies tonight within seven leagues of rome
antony post back with speed and tell him what hath chanced
 here is a mourning rome a dangerous rome
 no rome of safety for octavius yet
 hie hence and tell him so yet stay awhile
 thou shalt not back till i have borne this corse
 into the marketplace there shall i try
 in my oration how the people take
 the cruel issue of these bloody men
 according to the which thou shalt discourse
 to young octavius of the state of things
 lend me your hand
 exeunt with caesar's body
 julius caesar
act iii
scene ii the forum
 enter brutus and cassius and a throng of citizens
citizens we will be satisfied let us be satisfied
brutus then follow me and give me audience friends

 those that will hear me speak let em stay here
 those that will follow cassius go with him
 and public reasons shall be rendered
 of caesar's death

brutus be patient till the last
 romans countrymen and lovers hear me for my
 cause and be silent that you may hear believe me
 for mine honour and have respect to mine honour that
 you may believe censure me in your wisdom and
 awake your senses that you may the better judge
 if there be any in this assembly any dear friend of
 caesar's to him i say that brutus love to caesar
 was no less than his if then that friend demand
 why brutus rose against caesar this is my answer
 not that i loved caesar less but that i loved
 rome more had you rather caesar were living and
 die all slaves than that caesar were dead to live
 all free men as caesar loved me i weep for him
 as he was fortunate i rejoice at it as he was
 valiant i honour him but as he was ambitious i
 slew him there is tears for his love joy for his
 fortune honour for his valour and death for his
 ambition who is here so base that would be a
 bondman if any speak for him have i offended
 who is here so rude that would not be a roman if
 any speak for him have i offended who is here so
 vile that will not love his country if any speak
 for him have i offended i pause for a reply
all none brutus none
brutus then none have i offended i have done no more to
 caesar than you shall do to brutus the question of
 his death is enrolled in the capitol his glory not
 extenuated wherein he was worthy nor his offences
 enforced for which he suffered death
 enter antony and others with caesar's body
 here comes his body mourned by mark antony who
 though he had no hand in his death shall receive
 the benefit of his dying a place in the
 commonwealth as which of you shall not with this
 i departthat as i slew my best lover for the
 good of rome i have the same dagger for myself
 when it shall please my country to need my death
all live brutus live live

 tending to caesar's glories which mark antony
