act i
scene iii a room in the palace
 enter celia and rosalind
celia why cousin why rosalind cupid have mercy not a word
rosalind not one to throw at a dog
celia no thy words are too precious to be cast away upon
 curs throw some of them at me come lame me with reasons
rosalind then there were two cousins laid up when the one
 should be lamed with reasons and the other mad
 without any
celia but is all this for your father
rosalind no some of it is for my child's father o how
 full of briers is this workingday world
celia they are but burs cousin thrown upon thee in
 holiday foolery if we walk not in the trodden
 paths our very petticoats will catch them
rosalind i could shake them off my coat these burs are in my heart
celia hem them away
rosalind i would try if i could cry hem and have him
celia come come wrestle with thy affections
rosalind o they take the part of a better wrestler than myself
celia o a good wish upon you you will try in time in
 despite of a fall but turning these jests out of
 service let us talk in good earnest is it
 possible on such a sudden you should fall into so
 strong a liking with old sir rowland's youngest son
rosalind the duke my father loved his father dearly
celia doth it therefore ensue that you should love his son
 dearly by this kind of chase i should hate him
 for my father hated his father dearly yet i hate
 not orlando
rosalind no faith hate him not for my sake
celia why should i not doth he not deserve well
rosalind let me love him for that and do you love him
 because i do look here comes the duke
celia with his eyes full of anger
 enter duke frederick with lords
duke frederick mistress dispatch you with your safest haste
 and get you from our court
rosalind me uncle
duke frederick you cousin
 within these ten days if that thou be'st found
 so near our public court as twenty miles
 thou diest for it
rosalind i do beseech your grace
 let me the knowledge of my fault bear with me
 if with myself i hold intelligence
 or have acquaintance with mine own desires
 if that i do not dream or be not frantic
 as i do trust i am notthen dear uncle
 never so much as in a thought unborn
 did i offend your highness
duke frederick thus do all traitors
 if their purgation did consist in words
 they are as innocent as grace itself
 let it suffice thee that i trust thee not
rosalind yet your mistrust cannot make me a traitor
 tell me whereon the likelihood depends
duke frederick thou art thy father's daughter there's enough
rosalind so was i when your highness took his dukedom
 so was i when your highness banish'd him
 treason is not inherited my lord
 or if we did derive it from our friends
 what's that to me my father was no traitor
 then good my liege mistake me not so much
 to think my poverty is treacherous
celia dear sovereign hear me speak
duke frederick ay celia we stay'd her for your sake
 else had she with her father ranged along
celia i did not then entreat to have her stay
 it was your pleasure and your own remorse
 i was too young that time to value her
 but now i know her if she be a traitor
 why so am i we still have slept together
 rose at an instant learn'd play'd eat together
 and wheresoever we went like juno's swans
 still we went coupled and inseparable
duke frederick she is too subtle for thee and her smoothness
 her very silence and her patience
 speak to the people and they pity her
 thou art a fool she robs thee of thy name
 and thou wilt show more bright and seem more virtuous
 when she is gone then open not thy lips
 firm and irrevocable is my doom
 which i have pass'd upon her she is banish'd
celia pronounce that sentence then on me my liege
 i cannot live out of her company
duke frederick you are a fool you niece provide yourself
 if you outstay the time upon mine honour
 and in the greatness of my word you die
 exeunt duke frederick and lords
celia o my poor rosalind whither wilt thou go
 wilt thou change fathers i will give thee mine
 i charge thee be not thou more grieved than i am
rosalind i have more cause
celia thou hast not cousin
 prithee be cheerful know'st thou not the duke
 hath banish'd me his daughter
rosalind that he hath not
celia no hath not rosalind lacks then the love
 which teacheth thee that thou and i am one
 shall we be sunder'd shall we part sweet girl
 no let my father seek another heir
 therefore devise with me how we may fly
 whither to go and what to bear with us
 and do not seek to take your change upon you
 to bear your griefs yourself and leave me out
 for by this heaven now at our sorrows pale
 say what thou canst i'll go along with thee
rosalind why whither shall we go
celia to seek my uncle in the forest of arden
rosalind alas what danger will it be to us
 maids as we are to travel forth so far
 beauty provoketh thieves sooner than gold
celia i'll put myself in poor and mean attire
 and with a kind of umber smirch my face
 the like do you so shall we pass along
 and never stir assailants
rosalind were it not better
 because that i am more than common tall
 that i did suit me all points like a man
 a gallant curtleaxe upon my thigh
 a boarspear in my hand andin my heart
 lie there what hidden woman's fear there will
 we'll have a swashing and a martial outside
 as many other mannish cowards have
 that do outface it with their semblances
celia what shall i call thee when thou art a man
rosalind i'll have no worse a name than jove's own page
 and therefore look you call me ganymede
 but what will you be call'd
celia something that hath a reference to my state
 no longer celia but aliena
rosalind but cousin what if we assay'd to steal
 the clownish fool out of your father's court
 would he not be a comfort to our travel
celia he'll go along o'er the wide world with me
 leave me alone to woo him let's away
 and get our jewels and our wealth together
 devise the fittest time and safest way
 to hide us from pursuit that will be made
 after my flight now go we in content
 to liberty and not to banishment
 exeunt
 as you like it
act ii
scene i the forest of arden
 enter duke senior amiens and two or three lords
 like foresters
duke senior now my comates and brothers in exile
 hath not old custom made this life more sweet
 than that of painted pomp are not these woods
 more free from peril than the envious court
 here feel we but the penalty of adam
 the seasons difference as the icy fang
 and churlish chiding of the winter's wind
 which when it bites and blows upon my body
 even till i shrink with cold i smile and say
 this is no flattery these are counsellors
 that feelingly persuade me what i am'
 sweet are the uses of adversity
 which like the toad ugly and venomous
 wears yet a precious jewel in his head
 and this our life exempt from public haunt
 finds tongues in trees books in the running brooks
 sermons in stones and good in every thing
 i would not change it
amiens happy is your grace
 that can translate the stubbornness of fortune
 into so quiet and so sweet a style
duke senior come shall we go and kill us venison
 and yet it irks me the poor dappled fools
 being native burghers of this desert city
 should in their own confines with forked heads
 have their round haunches gored
first lord indeed my lord
 the melancholy jaques grieves at that
 and in that kind swears you do more usurp
 than doth your brother that hath banish'd you
 today my lord of amiens and myself
 did steal behind him as he lay along
 under an oak whose antique root peeps out
 upon the brook that brawls along this wood
 to the which place a poor sequester'd stag
 that from the hunter's aim had ta'en a hurt
 did come to languish and indeed my lord
 the wretched animal heaved forth such groans
 that their discharge did stretch his leathern coat
 almost to bursting and the big round tears
 coursed one another down his innocent nose
 in piteous chase and thus the hairy fool
 much marked of the melancholy jaques
 stood on the extremest verge of the swift brook
 augmenting it with tears
duke senior but what said jaques
 did he not moralize this spectacle
first lord o yes into a thousand similes
