and moses built an altar and called the name of it jehovahnissi
for he said because the lord hath sworn that the lord will have war with amalek from generation to generation
when jethro the priest of midian moses father in law heard of all that god had done for moses and for israel his people and that the lord had brought israel out of egypt
then jethro moses father in law took zipporah moses wife after he had sent her back
and her two sons of which the name of the one was gershom for he said i have been an alien in a strange land
and the name of the other was eliezer for the god of my father said he was mine help and delivered me from the sword of pharaoh
and jethro moses father in law came with his sons and his wife unto moses into the wilderness where he encamped at the mount of god
and he said unto moses i thy father in law jethro am come unto thee and thy wife and her two sons with her
and moses went out to meet his father in law and did obeisance and kissed him and they asked each other of their welfare and they came into the tent
and moses told his father in law all that the lord had done unto pharaoh and to the egyptians for israel's sake and all the travail that had come upon them by the way and how the lord delivered them
and jethro rejoiced for all the goodness which the lord had done to israel whom he had delivered out of the hand of the egyptians
and jethro said blessed be the lord who hath delivered you out of the hand of the egyptians and out of the hand of pharaoh who hath delivered the people from under the hand of the egyptians
now i know that the lord is greater than all gods for in the thing wherein they dealt proudly he was above them
and jethro moses father in law took a burnt offering and sacrifices for god and aaron came and all the elders of israel to eat bread with moses father in law before god
and it came to pass on the morrow that moses sat to judge the people and the people stood by moses from the morning unto the evening
and when moses father in law saw all that he did to the people he said what is this thing that thou doest to the people why sittest thou thyself alone and all the people stand by thee from morning unto even
and moses said unto his father in law because the people come unto me to enquire of god
when they have a matter they come unto me and i judge between one and another and i do make them know the statutes of god and his laws
and moses father in law said unto him the thing that thou doest is not good
thou wilt surely wear away both thou and this people that is with thee for this thing is too heavy for thee thou art not able to perform it thyself alone
hearken now unto my voice i will give thee counsel and god shall be with thee be thou for the people to godward that thou mayest bring the causes unto god
and thou shalt teach them ordinances and laws and shalt shew them the way wherein they must walk and the work that they must do
moreover thou shalt provide out of all the people able men such as fear god men of truth hating covetousness and place such over them to be rulers of thousands and rulers of hundreds rulers of fifties and rulers of tens
and let them judge the people at all seasons and it shall be that every great matter they shall bring unto thee but every small matter they shall judge so shall it be easier for thyself and they shall bear the burden with thee
if thou shalt do this thing and god command thee so then thou shalt be able to endure and all this people shall also go to their place in peace
so moses hearkened to the voice of his father in law and did all that he had said
and moses chose able men out of all israel and made them heads over the people rulers of thousands rulers of hundreds rulers of fifties and rulers of tens
and they judged the people at all seasons the hard causes they brought unto moses but every small matter they judged themselves
and moses let his father in law depart and he went his way into his own land
in the third month when the children of israel were gone forth out of the land of egypt the same day came they into the wilderness of sinai
for they were departed from rephidim and were come to the desert of sinai and had pitched in the wilderness and there israel camped before the mount
and moses went up unto god and the lord called unto him out of the mountain saying thus shalt thou say to the house of jacob and tell the children of israel
ye have seen what i did unto the egyptians and how i bare you on eagles wings and brought you unto myself
now therefore if ye will obey my voice indeed and keep my covenant then ye shall be a peculiar treasure unto me above all people for all the earth is mine
and ye shall be unto me a kingdom of priests and an holy nation these are the words which thou shalt speak unto the children of israel
and moses came and called for the elders of the people and laid before their faces all these words which the lord commanded him
and all the people answered together and said all that the lord hath spoken we will do and moses returned the words of the people unto the lord
and the lord said unto moses lo i come unto thee in a thick cloud that the people may hear when i speak with thee and believe thee for ever and moses told the words of the people unto the lord
and the lord said unto moses go unto the people and sanctify them to day and to morrow and let them wash their clothes
and be ready against the third day for the third day the lord will come down in the sight of all the people upon mount sinai
and thou shalt set bounds unto the people round about saying take heed to yourselves that ye go not up into the mount or touch the border of it whosoever toucheth the mount shall be surely put to death
there shall not an hand touch it but he shall surely be stoned or shot through whether it be beast or man it shall not live when the trumpet soundeth long they shall come up to the mount
and moses went down from the mount unto the people and sanctified the people and they washed their clothes
and he said unto the people be ready against the third day come not at your wives
and it came to pass on the third day in the morning that there were thunders and lightnings and a thick cloud upon the mount and the voice of the trumpet exceeding loud so that all the people that was in the camp trembled
and moses brought forth the people out of the camp to meet with god and they stood at the nether part of the mount
and mount sinai was altogether on a smoke because the lord descended upon it in fire and the smoke thereof ascended as the smoke of a furnace and the whole mount quaked greatly
and when the voice of the trumpet sounded long and waxed louder and louder moses spake and god answered him by a voice
and the lord came down upon mount sinai on the top of the mount and the lord called moses up to the top of the mount and moses went up
and the lord said unto moses go down charge the people lest they break through unto the lord to gaze and many of them perish
and let the priests also which come near to the lord sanctify themselves lest the lord break forth upon them
and moses said unto the lord the people cannot come up to mount sinai for thou chargedst us saying set bounds about the mount and sanctify it
and the lord said unto him away get thee down and thou shalt come up thou and aaron with thee but let not the priests and the people break through to come up unto the lord lest he break forth upon them
so moses went down unto the people and spake unto them
and god spake all these words saying
i am the lord thy god which have brought thee out of the land of egypt out of the house of bondage
thou shalt have no other gods before me
thou shalt not make unto thee any graven image or any likeness of any thing that is in heaven above or that is in the earth beneath or that is in the water under the earth
thou shalt not bow down thyself to them nor serve them for i the lord thy god am a jealous god visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children unto the third and fourth generation of them that hate me
and shewing mercy unto thousands of them that love me and keep my commandments
thou shalt not take the name of the lord thy god in vain for the lord will not hold him guiltless that taketh his name in vain
remember the sabbath day to keep it holy
six days shalt thou labour and do all thy work
but the seventh day is the sabbath of the lord thy god in it thou shalt not do any work thou nor thy son nor thy daughter thy manservant nor thy maidservant nor thy cattle nor thy stranger that is within thy gates
for in six days the lord made heaven and earth the sea and all that in them is and rested the seventh day wherefore the lord blessed the sabbath day and hallowed it
honour thy father and thy mother that thy days may be long upon the land which the lord thy god giveth thee
thou shalt not kill
thou shalt not commit adultery
thou shalt not steal
thou shalt not bear false witness against thy neighbour
thou shalt not covet thy neighbour's house thou shalt not covet thy neighbour's wife nor his manservant nor his maidservant nor his ox nor his ass nor any thing that is thy neighbour's
and all the people saw the thunderings and the lightnings and the noise of the trumpet and the mountain smoking and when the people saw it they removed and stood afar off
and they said unto moses speak thou with us and we will hear but let not god speak with us lest we die
and moses said unto the people fear not for god is come to prove you and that his fear may be before your faces that ye sin not
and the people stood afar off and moses drew near unto the thick darkness where god was
and the lord said unto moses thus thou shalt say unto the children of israel ye have seen that i have talked with you from heaven
ye shall not make with me gods of silver neither shall ye make unto you gods of gold
an altar of earth thou shalt make unto me and shalt sacrifice thereon thy burnt offerings and thy peace offerings thy sheep and thine oxen in all places where i record my name i will come unto thee and i will bless thee
and if thou wilt make me an altar of stone thou shalt not build it of hewn stone for if thou lift up thy tool upon it thou hast polluted it
neither shalt thou go up by steps unto mine altar that thy nakedness be not discovered thereon
now these are the judgments which thou shalt set before them

and he said unto moses come up unto the lord thou and aaron nadab and abihu and seventy of the elders of israel and worship ye afar off
and moses alone shall come near the lord but they shall not come nigh neither shall the people go up with him
and moses came and told the people all the words of the lord and all the judgments and all the people answered with one voice and said all the words which the lord hath said will we do
and moses wrote all the words of the lord and rose up early in the morning and builded an altar under the hill and twelve pillars according to the twelve tribes of israel
and he sent young men of the children of israel which offered burnt offerings and sacrificed peace offerings of oxen unto the lord
and moses took half of the blood and put it in basons and half of the blood he sprinkled on the altar
and he took the book of the covenant and read in the audience of the people and they said all that the lord hath said will we do and be obedient
and moses took the blood and sprinkled it on the people and said behold the blood of the covenant which the lord hath made with you concerning all these words
then went up moses and aaron nadab and abihu and seventy of the elders of israel
and they saw the god of israel and there was under his feet as it were a paved work of a sapphire stone and as it were the body of heaven in his clearness
and upon the nobles of the children of israel he laid not his hand also they saw god and did eat and drink
and the lord said unto moses come up to me into the mount and be there and i will give thee tables of stone and a law and commandments which i have written that thou mayest teach them
and moses rose up and his minister joshua and moses went up into the mount of god
and he said unto the elders tarry ye here for us until we come again unto you and behold aaron and hur are with you if any man have any matters to do let him come unto them
and moses went up into the mount and a cloud covered the mount
and the glory of the lord abode upon mount sinai and the cloud covered it six days and the seventh day he called unto moses out of the midst of the cloud
and the sight of the glory of the lord was like devouring fire on the top of the mount in the eyes of the children of israel
and moses went into the midst of the cloud and gat him up into the mount and moses was in the mount forty days and forty nights
and the lord spake unto moses saying
speak unto the children of israel that they bring me an offering of every man that giveth it willingly with his heart ye shall take my offering
