 for that he knew you might reproach your life
 and choke your good to come for his possessions
 although by confiscation they are ours
 we do instate and widow you withal
 to buy you a better husband
mariana o my dear lord
 i crave no other nor no better man
duke vincentio never crave him we are definitive
mariana gentle my liege
 kneeling
duke vincentio you do but lose your labour
 away with him to death
 to lucio
 now sir to you
mariana o my good lord sweet isabel take my part
 lend me your knees and all my life to come
 i'll lend you all my life to do you service
duke vincentio against all sense you do importune her
 should she kneel down in mercy of this fact
 her brother's ghost his paved bed would break
 and take her hence in horror
mariana isabel
 sweet isabel do yet but kneel by me
 hold up your hands say nothing i'll speak all
 they say best men are moulded out of faults
 and for the most become much more the better
 for being a little bad so may my husband
 o isabel will you not lend a knee
duke vincentio he dies for claudio's death
isabella most bounteous sir
 kneeling
 look if it please you on this man condemn'd
 as if my brother lived i partly think
 a due sincerity govern'd his deeds
 till he did look on me since it is so
 let him not die my brother had but justice
 in that he did the thing for which he died
 for angelo
 his act did not o'ertake his bad intent
 and must be buried but as an intent
 that perish'd by the way thoughts are no subjects
 intents but merely thoughts
mariana merely my lord
duke vincentio your suit's unprofitable stand up i say
 i have bethought me of another fault
 provost how came it claudio was beheaded
 at an unusual hour
provost it was commanded so
duke vincentio had you a special warrant for the deed
provost no my good lord it was by private message
duke vincentio for which i do discharge you of your office
 give up your keys
provost pardon me noble lord
 i thought it was a fault but knew it not
 yet did repent me after more advice
 for testimony whereof one in the prison
 that should by private order else have died
 i have reserved alive
duke vincentio what's he
provost his name is barnardine
duke vincentio i would thou hadst done so by claudio
 go fetch him hither let me look upon him
 exit provost
escalus i am sorry one so learned and so wise
 as you lord angelo have still appear'd
 should slip so grossly both in the heat of blood
 and lack of temper'd judgment afterward
angelo i am sorry that such sorrow i procure
 and so deep sticks it in my penitent heart
 that i crave death more willingly than mercy
 tis my deserving and i do entreat it
 reenter provost with barnardine claudio muffled
 and juliet
duke vincentio which is that barnardine
provost this my lord
duke vincentio there was a friar told me of this man
 sirrah thou art said to have a stubborn soul
 that apprehends no further than this world
 and squarest thy life according thou'rt condemn'd
 but for those earthly faults i quit them all
 and pray thee take this mercy to provide
 for better times to come friar advise him
 i leave him to your hand what muffled fellow's that
provost this is another prisoner that i saved
 who should have died when claudio lost his head
 as like almost to claudio as himself
 unmuffles claudio
duke vincentio to isabella if he be like your brother for his sake
 is he pardon'd and for your lovely sake
 give me your hand and say you will be mine
 he is my brother too but fitter time for that
 by this lord angelo perceives he's safe
 methinks i see a quickening in his eye
 well angelo your evil quits you well
 look that you love your wife her worth worth yours
 i find an apt remission in myself
 and yet here's one in place i cannot pardon
 to lucio
 you sirrah that knew me for a fool a coward
 one all of luxury an ass a madman
 wherein have i so deserved of you
 that you extol me thus
lucio faith my lord i spoke it but according to the
 trick if you will hang me for it you may but i
 had rather it would please you i might be whipt
duke vincentio whipt first sir and hanged after
 proclaim it provost round about the city
 is any woman wrong'd by this lewd fellow
 as i have heard him swear himself there's one
 whom he begot with child let her appear
 and he shall marry her the nuptial finish'd
 let him be whipt and hang'd
lucio i beseech your highness do not marry me to a whore
 your highness said even now i made you a duke
 good my lord do not recompense me in making me a cuckold
duke vincentio upon mine honour thou shalt marry her
 thy slanders i forgive and therewithal
 remit thy other forfeits take him to prison
 and see our pleasure herein executed
lucio marrying a punk my lord is pressing to death
 whipping and hanging
duke vincentio slandering a prince deserves it
 exit officers with lucio
 she claudio that you wrong'd look you restore
 joy to you mariana love her angelo
 i have confess'd her and i know her virtue
 thanks good friend escalus for thy much goodness
 there's more behind that is more gratulate
 thanks provost for thy care and secrecy
 we shill employ thee in a worthier place
 forgive him angelo that brought you home
 the head of ragozine for claudio's
 the offence pardons itself dear isabel
 i have a motion much imports your good
 whereto if you'll a willing ear incline
 what's mine is yours and what is yours is mine
 so bring us to our palace where we'll show
 what's yet behind that's meet you all should know

scene i venice a street
 enter antonio salarino and salanio
antonio in sooth i know not why i am so sad
 it wearies me you say it wearies you
 but how i caught it found it or came by it
 what stuff tis made of whereof it is born
 i am to learn
 and such a wantwit sadness makes of me
 that i have much ado to know myself
salarino your mind is tossing on the ocean
 there where your argosies with portly sail
 like signiors and rich burghers on the flood
 or as it were the pageants of the sea
 do overpeer the petty traffickers
 that curtsy to them do them reverence
 as they fly by them with their woven wings
salanio believe me sir had i such venture forth
 the better part of my affections would
 be with my hopes abroad i should be still
 plucking the grass to know where sits the wind
 peering in maps for ports and piers and roads
 and every object that might make me fear
 misfortune to my ventures out of doubt
 would make me sad
