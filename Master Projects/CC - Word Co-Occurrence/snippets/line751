 and i a gasping newdeliver'd mother
 have woe to woe sorrow to sorrow join'd
bushy despair not madam
queen who shall hinder me
 i will despair and be at enmity
 with cozening hope he is a flatterer
 a parasite a keeper back of death
 who gently would dissolve the bands of life
 which false hope lingers in extremity
 enter duke of york
green here comes the duke of york
queen with signs of war about his aged neck
 o full of careful business are his looks
 uncle for god's sake speak comfortable words
duke of york should i do so i should belie my thoughts
 comfort's in heaven and we are on the earth
 where nothing lives but crosses cares and grief
 your husband he is gone to save far off
 whilst others come to make him lose at home
 here am i left to underprop his land
 who weak with age cannot support myself
 now comes the sick hour that his surfeit made
 now shall he try his friends that flatter'd him
 enter a servant
servant my lord your son was gone before i came
duke of york he was why so go all which way it will
 the nobles they are fled the commons they are cold
 and will i fear revolt on hereford's side
 sirrah get thee to plashy to my sister gloucester
 bid her send me presently a thousand pound
 hold take my ring
servant my lord i had forgot to tell your lordship
 today as i came by i called there
 but i shall grieve you to report the rest
duke of york what is't knave
servant an hour before i came the duchess died
duke of york god for his mercy what a tide of woes
 comes rushing on this woeful land at once
 i know not what to do i would to god
 so my untruth had not provoked him to it
 the king had cut off my head with my brother's
 what are there no posts dispatch'd for ireland
 how shall we do for money for these wars
 come sistercousin i would saypray pardon me
 go fellow get thee home provide some carts
 and bring away the armour that is there
 exit servant
 gentlemen will you go muster men
 if i know how or which way to order these affairs
 thus thrust disorderly into my hands
 never believe me both are my kinsmen
 the one is my sovereign whom both my oath
 and duty bids defend the other again
 is my kinsman whom the king hath wrong'd
 whom conscience and my kindred bids to right
 well somewhat we must do come cousin i'll
 dispose of you
 gentlemen go muster up your men
 and meet me presently at berkeley
 i should to plashy too
 but time will not permit all is uneven
 and every thing is left at six and seven
 exeunt duke of york and queen
bushy the wind sits fair for news to go to ireland
 but none returns for us to levy power
 proportionable to the enemy
 is all unpossible
green besides our nearness to the king in love
 is near the hate of those love not the king
bagot and that's the wavering commons for their love
 lies in their purses and whoso empties them
 by so much fills their hearts with deadly hate
bushy wherein the king stands generally condemn'd
bagot if judgement lie in them then so do we
 because we ever have been near the king
green well i will for refuge straight to bristol castle
 the earl of wiltshire is already there
bushy thither will i with you for little office
 the hateful commons will perform for us
 except like curs to tear us all to pieces
 will you go along with us
bagot no i will to ireland to his majesty
 farewell if heart's presages be not vain
 we three here art that ne'er shall meet again
bushy that's as york thrives to beat back bolingbroke
green alas poor duke the task he undertakes
 is numbering sands and drinking oceans dry
 where one on his side fights thousands will fly
 farewell at once for once for all and ever
bushy well we may meet again
bagot i fear me never
 exeunt
 king richard ii
act ii
scene iii wilds in gloucestershire
 enter henry bolingbroke and northumberland with forces
henry bolingbroke how far is it my lord to berkeley now
northumberland believe me noble lord
 i am a stranger here in gloucestershire
 these high wild hills and rough uneven ways
 draws out our miles and makes them wearisome
 and yet your fair discourse hath been as sugar
 making the hard way sweet and delectable
 but i bethink me what a weary way
 from ravenspurgh to cotswold will be found
 in ross and willoughby wanting your company
 which i protest hath very much beguiled
 the tediousness and process of my travel
 but theirs is sweetened with the hope to have
 the present benefit which i possess
 and hope to joy is little less in joy
 than hope enjoy'd by this the weary lords
 shall make their way seem short as mine hath done
 by sight of what i have your noble company
henry bolingbroke of much less value is my company
 than your good words but who comes here
 enter henry percy
northumberland it is my son young harry percy
 sent from my brother worcester whencesoever
 harry how fares your uncle
henry percy i had thought my lord to have learn'd his health of you
northumberland why is he not with the queen
henry percy no my good lord he hath forsook the court
 broken his staff of office and dispersed
 the household of the king
northumberland what was his reason
 he was not so resolved when last we spake together
henry percy because your lordship was proclaimed traitor
 but he my lord is gone to ravenspurgh
 to offer service to the duke of hereford
 and sent me over by berkeley to discover
 what power the duke of york had levied there
 then with directions to repair to ravenspurgh
northumberland have you forgot the duke of hereford boy
henry percy no my good lord for that is not forgot
 which ne'er i did remember to my knowledge
 i never in my life did look on him
northumberland then learn to know him now this is the duke
henry percy my gracious lord i tender you my service
 such as it is being tender raw and young
 which elder days shall ripen and confirm
 to more approved service and desert
henry bolingbroke i thank thee gentle percy and be sure
 i count myself in nothing else so happy
 as in a soul remembering my good friends
 and as my fortune ripens with thy love
 it shall be still thy true love's recompense
 my heart this covenant makes my hand thus seals it
northumberland how far is it to berkeley and what stir
 keeps good old york there with his men of war
henry percy there stands the castle by yon tuft of trees
 mann'd with three hundred men as i have heard
 and in it are the lords of york berkeley and seymour
 none else of name and noble estimate
 enter lord ross and lord willoughby
northumberland here come the lords of ross and willoughby
 bloody with spurring fieryred with haste
henry bolingbroke welcome my lords i wot your love pursues
 a banish'd traitor all my treasury
 is yet but unfelt thanks which more enrich'd
 shall be your love and labour's recompense
lord ross your presence makes us rich most noble lord
lord willoughby and far surmounts our labour to attain it
henry bolingbroke evermore thanks the exchequer of the poor
 which till my infant fortune comes to years
 stands for my bounty but who comes here
 enter lord berkeley
northumberland it is my lord of berkeley as i guess
lord berkeley my lord of hereford my message is to you
henry bolingbroke my lord my answer isto lancaster
 and i am come to seek that name in england
 and i must find that title in your tongue
 before i make reply to aught you say
lord berkeley mistake me not my lord tis not my meaning
 to raze one title of your honour out
 to you my lord i come what lord you will
 from the most gracious regent of this land
 the duke of york to know what pricks you on
 to take advantage of the absent time
 and fright our native peace with selfborn arms
 enter duke of york attended
henry bolingbroke i shall not need transport my words by you
 here comes his grace in person my noble uncle
 kneels
duke of york show me thy humble heart and not thy knee
 whose duty is deceiveable and false
henry bolingbroke my gracious uncle
duke of york tut tut
 grace me no grace nor uncle me no uncle
 i am no traitor's uncle and that word grace'
 in an ungracious mouth is but profane
 why have those banish'd and forbidden legs
 dared once to touch a dust of england's ground
 but then more why why have they dared to march
 so many miles upon her peaceful bosom
 frighting her palefaced villages with war
 and ostentation of despised arms
 comest thou because the anointed king is hence
 why foolish boy the king is left behind
 and in my loyal bosom lies his power
