 enter mercade
mercade god save you madam
princess welcome mercade
 but that thou interrupt'st our merriment
mercade i am sorry madam for the news i bring
 is heavy in my tongue the king your father
princess dead for my life
mercade even so my tale is told
biron worthies away the scene begins to cloud
don
adriano de armado for mine own part i breathe free breath i have
 seen the day of wrong through the little hole of
 discretion and i will right myself like a soldier
 exeunt worthies
ferdinand how fares your majesty
princess boyet prepare i will away tonight
ferdinand madam not so i do beseech you stay
princess prepare i say i thank you gracious lords
 for all your fair endeavors and entreat
 out of a newsad soul that you vouchsafe
 in your rich wisdom to excuse or hide
 the liberal opposition of our spirits
 if overboldly we have borne ourselves
 in the converse of breath your gentleness
 was guilty of it farewell worthy lord
 a heavy heart bears not a nimble tongue
 excuse me so coming too short of thanks
 for my great suit so easily obtain'd
ferdinand the extreme parts of time extremely forms
 all causes to the purpose of his speed
 and often at his very loose decides
 that which long process could not arbitrate
 and though the mourning brow of progeny
 forbid the smiling courtesy of love
 the holy suit which fain it would convince
 yet since love's argument was first on foot
 let not the cloud of sorrow justle it
 from what it purposed since to wail friends lost
 is not by much so wholesomeprofitable
 as to rejoice at friends but newly found
princess i understand you not my griefs are double
biron honest plain words best pierce the ear of grief
 and by these badges understand the king
 for your fair sakes have we neglected time
 play'd foul play with our oaths your beauty ladies
 hath much deform'd us fashioning our humours
 even to the opposed end of our intents
 and what in us hath seem'd ridiculous
 as love is full of unbefitting strains
 all wanton as a child skipping and vain
 form'd by the eye and therefore like the eye
 full of strange shapes of habits and of forms
 varying in subjects as the eye doth roll
 to every varied object in his glance
 which particoated presence of loose love
 put on by us if in your heavenly eyes
 have misbecomed our oaths and gravities
 those heavenly eyes that look into these faults
 suggested us to make therefore ladies
 our love being yours the error that love makes
 is likewise yours we to ourselves prove false
 by being once false for ever to be true
 to those that make us bothfair ladies you
 and even that falsehood in itself a sin
 thus purifies itself and turns to grace
princess we have received your letters full of love
 your favours the ambassadors of love
 and in our maiden council rated them
 at courtship pleasant jest and courtesy
 as bombast and as lining to the time
 but more devout than this in our respects
 have we not been and therefore met your loves
 in their own fashion like a merriment
dumain our letters madam show'd much more than jest
longaville so did our looks
rosaline we did not quote them so
ferdinand now at the latest minute of the hour
 grant us your loves
princess a time methinks too short
 to make a worldwithoutend bargain in
 no no my lord your grace is perjured much
 full of dear guiltiness and therefore this
 if for my love as there is no such cause
 you will do aught this shall you do for me
 your oath i will not trust but go with speed
 to some forlorn and naked hermitage
 remote from all the pleasures of the world
 there stay until the twelve celestial signs
 have brought about the annual reckoning
 if this austere insociable life
 change not your offer made in heat of blood
 if frosts and fasts hard lodging and thin weeds
 nip not the gaudy blossoms of your love
 but that it bear this trial and last love
 then at the expiration of the year
 come challenge me challenge me by these deserts
 and by this virgin palm now kissing thine
 i will be thine and till that instant shut
 my woeful self up in a mourning house
 raining the tears of lamentation
 for the remembrance of my father's death
 if this thou do deny let our hands part
 neither entitled in the other's heart
ferdinand if this or more than this i would deny
 to flatter up these powers of mine with rest
 the sudden hand of death close up mine eye
 hence ever then my heart is in thy breast
biron and what to me my love and what to me
rosaline you must be purged too your sins are rack'd
 you are attaint with faults and perjury
 therefore if you my favour mean to get
 a twelvemonth shall you spend and never rest
 but seek the weary beds of people sick
dumain but what to me my love but what to me a wife
katharine a beard fair health and honesty
 with threefold love i wish you all these three
dumain o shall i say i thank you gentle wife
katharine not so my lord a twelvemonth and a day
 i'll mark no words that smoothfaced wooers say
 come when the king doth to my lady come
 then if i have much love i'll give you some
dumain i'll serve thee true and faithfully till then
katharine yet swear not lest ye be forsworn again
longaville what says maria
maria at the twelvemonth's end
 i'll change my black gown for a faithful friend
longaville i'll stay with patience but the time is long
maria the liker you few taller are so young
biron studies my lady mistress look on me
 behold the window of my heart mine eye
 what humble suit attends thy answer there
 impose some service on me for thy love
rosaline oft have i heard of you my lord biron
 before i saw you and the world's large tongue
 proclaims you for a man replete with mocks
 full of comparisons and wounding flouts
 which you on all estates will execute
 that lie within the mercy of your wit
 to weed this wormwood from your fruitful brain
 and therewithal to win me if you please
 without the which i am not to be won
 you shall this twelvemonth term from day to day
 visit the speechless sick and still converse
 with groaning wretches and your task shall be
 with all the fierce endeavor of your wit
 to enforce the pained impotent to smile
biron to move wild laughter in the throat of death
 it cannot be it is impossible
 mirth cannot move a soul in agony
rosaline why that's the way to choke a gibing spirit
 whose influence is begot of that loose grace
 which shallow laughing hearers give to fools
 a jest's prosperity lies in the ear
 of him that hears it never in the tongue
 of him that makes it then if sickly ears
 deaf'd with the clamours of their own dear groans
 will hear your idle scorns continue then
 and i will have you and that fault withal
 but if they will not throw away that spirit
 and i shall find you empty of that fault
 right joyful of your reformation
biron a twelvemonth well befall what will befall
 i'll jest a twelvemonth in an hospital
princess to ferdinand ay sweet my lord and so i take my leave
ferdinand no madam we will bring you on your way
