 and proved the subject of my own soul's curse
 which ever since hath kept my eyes from rest
 for never yet one hour in his bed
 have i enjoy'd the golden dew of sleep
 but have been waked by his timorous dreams
 besides he hates me for my father warwick
 and will no doubt shortly be rid of me
queen elizabeth poor heart adieu i pity thy complaining
lady anne no more than from my soul i mourn for yours
queen elizabeth farewell thou woful welcomer of glory
lady anne adieu poor soul that takest thy leave of it
duchess of york to dorset
 go thou to richmond and good fortune guide thee
 to lady anne
 go thou to richard and good angels guard thee
 to queen elizabeth
 go thou to sanctuary and good thoughts possess thee
 i to my grave where peace and rest lie with me
 eighty odd years of sorrow have i seen
 and each hour's joy wrecked with a week of teen
queen elizabeth stay yet look back with me unto the tower
 pity you ancient stones those tender babes
 whom envy hath immured within your walls
 rough cradle for such little pretty ones
 rude ragged nurse old sullen playfellow
 for tender princes use my babies well
 so foolish sorrow bids your stones farewell

 have told me i being by that i should kill him
buckingham my lord your promise for the earldom
king richard iii richmond when last i was at exeter

act iv
scene iii the same
 enter tyrrel
tyrrel the tyrannous and bloody deed is done
 the most arch of piteous massacre
 that ever yet this land was guilty of
 dighton and forrest whom i did suborn
 to do this ruthless piece of butchery
 although they were flesh'd villains bloody dogs
 melting with tenderness and kind compassion
 wept like two children in their deaths sad stories
 lo thus quoth dighton lay those tender babes'
 thus thus quoth forrest girdling one another
 within their innocent alabaster arms
 their lips were four red roses on a stalk
 which in their summer beauty kiss'd each other
 a book of prayers on their pillow lay
 which once quoth forrest almost changed my mind
 but o the devil'there the villain stopp'd
 whilst dighton thus told on we smothered
