act iii
scene ii before lord hastings house
 enter a messenger
messenger what ho my lord
hastings within who knocks at the door
messenger a messenger from the lord stanley
 enter hastings
hastings what is't o'clock
messenger upon the stroke of four
hastings cannot thy master sleep these tedious nights
messenger so it should seem by that i have to say
 first he commends him to your noble lordship
hastings and then
messenger and then he sends you word
 he dreamt tonight the boar had razed his helm
 besides he says there are two councils held
 and that may be determined at the one
 which may make you and him to rue at the other
 therefore he sends to know your lordship's pleasure
 if presently you will take horse with him
 and with all speed post with him toward the north
 to shun the danger that his soul divines
hastings go fellow go return unto thy lord
 bid him not fear the separated councils
 his honour and myself are at the one
 and at the other is my servant catesby
 where nothing can proceed that toucheth us
 whereof i shall not have intelligence
 tell him his fears are shallow wanting instance
 and for his dreams i wonder he is so fond
 to trust the mockery of unquiet slumbers
 to fly the boar before the boar pursues
 were to incense the boar to follow us
 and make pursuit where he did mean no chase
 go bid thy master rise and come to me
 and we will both together to the tower
 where he shall see the boar will use us kindly
messenger my gracious lord i'll tell him what you say
 exit
 enter catesby
catesby many good morrows to my noble lord
hastings good morrow catesby you are early stirring
 what news what news in this our tottering state
catesby it is a reeling world indeed my lord
 and i believe twill never stand upright
 tim richard wear the garland of the realm
hastings how wear the garland dost thou mean the crown
catesby ay my good lord
hastings i'll have this crown of mine cut from my shoulders
 ere i will see the crown so foul misplaced
 but canst thou guess that he doth aim at it
catesby ay on my life and hopes to find forward
 upon his party for the gain thereof
 and thereupon he sends you this good news
 that this same very day your enemies
 the kindred of the queen must die at pomfret
hastings indeed i am no mourner for that news
 because they have been still mine enemies
 but that i'll give my voice on richard's side
 to bar my master's heirs in true descent
 god knows i will not do it to the death
catesby god keep your lordship in that gracious mind
hastings but i shall laugh at this a twelvemonth hence
 that they who brought me in my master's hate
 i live to look upon their tragedy
 i tell thee catesby
catesby what my lord
hastings ere a fortnight make me elder
 i'll send some packing that yet think not on it
catesby tis a vile thing to die my gracious lord
 when men are unprepared and look not for it
hastings o monstrous monstrous and so falls it out
 with rivers vaughan grey and so twill do
 with some men else who think themselves as safe
 as thou and i who as thou know'st are dear
 to princely richard and to buckingham
catesby the princes both make high account of you
 aside
 for they account his head upon the bridge
hastings i know they do and i have well deserved it
 enter stanley
 come on come on where is your boarspear man
 fear you the boar and go so unprovided
stanley my lord good morrow good morrow catesby
 you may jest on but by the holy rood
 i do not like these several councils i
hastings my lord
 i hold my life as dear as you do yours
 and never in my life i do protest
 was it more precious to me than tis now
 think you but that i know our state secure
 i would be so triumphant as i am
stanley the lords at pomfret when they rode from london
 were jocund and supposed their state was sure
 and they indeed had no cause to mistrust
 but yet you see how soon the day o'ercast
 this sudden stag of rancour i misdoubt
 pray god i say i prove a needless coward
 what shall we toward the tower the day is spent
hastings come come have with you wot you what my lord
 today the lords you talk of are beheaded
lord stanley they for their truth might better wear their heads
 than some that have accused them wear their hats
 but come my lord let us away
 enter a pursuivant
hastings go on before i'll talk with this good fellow
 exeunt stanley and catesby
 how now sirrah how goes the world with thee
pursuivant the better that your lordship please to ask
hastings i tell thee man tis better with me now
 than when i met thee last where now we meet
 then was i going prisoner to the tower
 by the suggestion of the queen's allies
 but now i tell theekeep it to thyself
 this day those enemies are put to death
 and i in better state than e'er i was
pursuivant god hold it to your honour's good content
hastings gramercy fellow there drink that for me
 throws him his purse
pursuivant god save your lordship
 exit
 enter a priest
priest well met my lord i am glad to see your honour
hastings i thank thee good sir john with all my heart
 i am in your debt for your last exercise
 come the next sabbath and i will content you
 he whispers in his ear
 enter buckingham
buckingham what talking with a priest lord chamberlain
 your friends at pomfret they do need the priest
 your honour hath no shriving work in hand
hastings good faith and when i met this holy man
 those men you talk of came into my mind
 what go you toward the tower
buckingham i do my lord but long i shall not stay
 i shall return before your lordship thence
hastings tis like enough for i stay dinner there
buckingham aside and supper too although thou know'st it not
 come will you go
hastings i'll wait upon your lordship

scene iii pomfret castle
 enter ratcliff with halberds carrying rivers
 grey and vaughan to death
ratcliff come bring forth the prisoners
rivers sir richard ratcliff let me tell thee this
 today shalt thou behold a subject die
 for truth for duty and for loyalty
grey god keep the prince from all the pack of you
 a knot you are of damned bloodsuckers
vaughan you live that shall cry woe for this after
ratcliff dispatch the limit of your lives is out
rivers o pomfret pomfret o thou bloody prison
 fatal and ominous to noble peers
 within the guilty closure of thy walls
 richard the second here was hack'd to death
 and for more slander to thy dismal seat
 we give thee up our guiltless blood to drink
grey now margaret's curse is fall'n upon our heads
 for standing by when richard stabb'd her son
rivers then cursed she hastings then cursed she buckingham
 then cursed she richard o remember god
 to hear her prayers for them as now for us
 and for my sister and her princely sons
 be satisfied dear god with our true blood
 which as thou know'st unjustly must be spilt
ratcliff make haste the hour of death is expiate
rivers come grey come vaughan let us all embrace
 and take our leave until we meet in heaven

scene iv the tower of london
 enter buckingham derby hastings the bishop of
 ely ratcliff lovel with others and take their
 seats at a table
hastings my lords at once the cause why we are met
 is to determine of the coronation
 in god's name speak when is the royal day
buckingham are all things fitting for that royal time
derby it is and wants but nomination
bishop of ely tomorrow then i judge a happy day
buckingham who knows the lord protector's mind herein
 who is most inward with the royal duke
bishop of ely your grace we think should soonest know his mind
buckingham who i my lord i we know each other's faces
 but for our hearts he knows no more of mine
 than i of yours
 nor i no more of his than you of mine
 lord hastings you and he are near in love
hastings i thank his grace i know he loves me well
 but for his purpose in the coronation
 i have not sounded him nor he deliver'd
