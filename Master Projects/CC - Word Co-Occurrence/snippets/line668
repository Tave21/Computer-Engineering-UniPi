 and nod their heads and throw their eyes on thee
 ah gloucester hide thee from their hateful looks
 and in thy closet pent up rue my shame
 and ban thine enemies both mine and thine
gloucester be patient gentle nell forget this grief
duchess ah gloucester teach me to forget myself
 for whilst i think i am thy married wife
 and thou a prince protector of this land
 methinks i should not thus be led along
 mail'd up in shame with papers on my back
 and followed with a rabble that rejoice
 to see my tears and hear my deepfet groans
 the ruthless flint doth cut my tender feet
 and when i start the envious people laugh
 and bid me be advised how i tread
 ah humphrey can i bear this shameful yoke
 trow'st thou that e'er i'll look upon the world
 or count them happy that enjoy the sun
 no dark shall be my light and night my day
 to think upon my pomp shall be my hell
 sometime i'll say i am duke humphrey's wife
 and he a prince and ruler of the land
 yet so he ruled and such a prince he was
 as he stood by whilst i his forlorn duchess
 was made a wonder and a pointingstock
 to every idle rascal follower
 but be thou mild and blush not at my shame
 nor stir at nothing till the axe of death
 hang over thee as sure it shortly will
 for suffolk he that can do all in all
 with her that hateth thee and hates us all
 and york and impious beaufort that false priest
 have all limed bushes to betray thy wings
 and fly thou how thou canst they'll tangle thee
 but fear not thou until thy foot be snared
 nor never seek prevention of thy foes
gloucester ah nell forbear thou aimest all awry
 i must offend before i be attainted
 and had i twenty times so many foes
 and each of them had twenty times their power
 all these could not procure me any scathe
 so long as i am loyal true and crimeless
 wouldst have me rescue thee from this reproach
 why yet thy scandal were not wiped away
 but i in danger for the breach of law
 thy greatest help is quiet gentle nell
 i pray thee sort thy heart to patience
 these few days wonder will be quickly worn

 2 king henry vi
act iii
scene i the abbey at bury st edmund's
 sound a sennet enter king henry vi queen
 margaret cardinal suffolk york buckingham
 salisbury and warwick to the parliament
king henry vi i muse my lord of gloucester is not come
 tis not his wont to be the hindmost man
 whate'er occasion keeps him from us now
queen margaret can you not see or will ye not observe
 the strangeness of his alter'd countenance
 with what a majesty he bears himself
 how insolent of late he is become
 how proud how peremptory and unlike himself
 we know the time since he was mild and affable
 and if we did but glance a faroff look
 immediately he was upon his knee
 that all the court admired him for submission
 but meet him now and be it in the morn
 when every one will give the time of day
 he knits his brow and shows an angry eye
 and passeth by with stiff unbowed knee
 disdaining duty that to us belongs
 small curs are not regarded when they grin
 but great men tremble when the lion roars
 and humphrey is no little man in england
 first note that he is near you in descent
 and should you fall he as the next will mount
 me seemeth then it is no policy
 respecting what a rancorous mind he bears
 and his advantage following your decease
 that he should come about your royal person
 or be admitted to your highness council
 by flattery hath he won the commons hearts
 and when he please to make commotion
 tis to be fear'd they all will follow him
 now tis the spring and weeds are shallowrooted
 suffer them now and they'll o'ergrow the garden
 and choke the herbs for want of husbandry
 the reverent care i bear unto my lord
 made me collect these dangers in the duke
 if it be fond call it a woman's fear
 which fear if better reasons can supplant
 i will subscribe and say i wrong'd the duke
 my lord of suffolk buckingham and york
 reprove my allegation if you can
 or else conclude my words effectual
suffolk well hath your highness seen into this duke
 and had i first been put to speak my mind
 i think i should have told your grace's tale
 the duchess by his subornation
 upon my life began her devilish practises
 or if he were not privy to those faults
 yet by reputing of his high descent
 as next the king he was successive heir
 and such high vaunts of his nobility
 did instigate the bedlam brainsick duchess
 by wicked means to frame our sovereign's fall
 smooth runs the water where the brook is deep
 and in his simple show he harbours treason
 the fox barks not when he would steal the lamb
 no no my sovereign gloucester is a man
 unsounded yet and full of deep deceit
cardinal did he not contrary to form of law
 devise strange deaths for small offences done
york and did he not in his protectorship
 levy great sums of money through the realm
 for soldiers pay in france and never sent it
 by means whereof the towns each day revolted
buckingham tut these are petty faults to faults unknown
 which time will bring to light in smooth
 duke humphrey
king henry vi my lords at once the care you have of us
 to mow down thorns that would annoy our foot
 is worthy praise but shall i speak my conscience
 our kinsman gloucester is as innocent
 from meaning treason to our royal person
 as is the sucking lamb or harmless dove
 the duke is virtuous mild and too well given
 to dream on evil or to work my downfall
queen margaret ah what's more dangerous than this fond affiance
 seems he a dove his feathers are but borrowed
 for he's disposed as the hateful raven
 is he a lamb his skin is surely lent him
 for he's inclined as is the ravenous wolf
 who cannot steal a shape that means deceit
 take heed my lord the welfare of us all
 hangs on the cutting short that fraudful man
 enter somerset
somerset all health unto my gracious sovereign
king henry vi welcome lord somerset what news from france
somerset that all your interest in those territories
 is utterly bereft you all is lost
king henry vi cold news lord somerset but god's will be done
york aside cold news for me for i had hope of france
 as firmly as i hope for fertile england
 thus are my blossoms blasted in the bud
 and caterpillars eat my leaves away
 but i will remedy this gear ere long
 or sell my title for a glorious grave
 enter gloucester
gloucester all happiness unto my lord the king
 pardon my liege that i have stay'd so long
suffolk nay gloucester know that thou art come too soon
 unless thou wert more loyal than thou art
 i do arrest thee of high treason here
gloucester well suffolk thou shalt not see me blush
