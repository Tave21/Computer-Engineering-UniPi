brutus good words are better than bad strokes octavius
antony in your bad strokes brutus you give good words
 witness the hole you made in caesar's heart
 crying long live hail caesar'
cassius antony
 the posture of your blows are yet unknown
 but for your words they rob the hybla bees
 and leave them honeyless
antony not stingless too
brutus o yes and soundless too
 for you have stol'n their buzzing antony
 and very wisely threat before you sting
antony villains you did not so when your vile daggers
 hack'd one another in the sides of caesar
 you show'd your teeth like apes and fawn'd like hounds
 and bow'd like bondmen kissing caesar's feet
 whilst damned casca like a cur behind
 struck caesar on the neck o you flatterers
cassius flatterers now brutus thank yourself
 this tongue had not offended so today
 if cassius might have ruled
octavius come come the cause if arguing make us sweat
 the proof of it will turn to redder drops look
 i draw a sword against conspirators
 when think you that the sword goes up again
 never till caesar's three and thirty wounds
 be well avenged or till another caesar
 have added slaughter to the sword of traitors
brutus caesar thou canst not die by traitors hands
 unless thou bring'st them with thee
octavius so i hope
 i was not born to die on brutus sword
brutus o if thou wert the noblest of thy strain
 young man thou couldst not die more honourable
cassius a peevish schoolboy worthless of such honour
 join'd with a masker and a reveller
antony old cassius still
octavius come antony away
 defiance traitors hurl we in your teeth
 if you dare fight today come to the field
 if not when you have stomachs
 exeunt octavius antony and their army
cassius why now blow wind swell billow and swim bark
 the storm is up and all is on the hazard
brutus ho lucilius hark a word with you
lucilius standing forth my lord
 brutus and lucilius converse apart
cassius messala
messala standing forth what says my general
cassius messala
 this is my birthday as this very day
 was cassius born give me thy hand messala
 be thou my witness that against my will
 as pompey was am i compell'd to set
 upon one battle all our liberties
 you know that i held epicurus strong
 and his opinion now i change my mind
 and partly credit things that do presage
 coming from sardis on our former ensign
 two mighty eagles fell and there they perch'd
 gorging and feeding from our soldiers hands
 who to philippi here consorted us
 this morning are they fled away and gone
 and in their steads do ravens crows and kites
 fly o'er our heads and downward look on us
 as we were sickly prey their shadows seem
 a canopy most fatal under which
 our army lies ready to give up the ghost
messala believe not so
cassius i but believe it partly
 for i am fresh of spirit and resolved
 to meet all perils very constantly
brutus even so lucilius
cassius now most noble brutus
 the gods today stand friendly that we may
 lovers in peace lead on our days to age
 but since the affairs of men rest still incertain
 let's reason with the worst that may befall
 if we do lose this battle then is this
 the very last time we shall speak together
 what are you then determined to do
brutus even by the rule of that philosophy
 by which i did blame cato for the death
 which he did give himself i know not how
 but i do find it cowardly and vile
 for fear of what might fall so to prevent
 the time of life arming myself with patience
 to stay the providence of some high powers
 that govern us below
cassius then if we lose this battle
 you are contented to be led in triumph
 thorough the streets of rome
brutus no cassius no think not thou noble roman
 that ever brutus will go bound to rome
 he bears too great a mind but this same day
 must end that work the ides of march begun
 and whether we shall meet again i know not
 therefore our everlasting farewell take
 for ever and for ever farewell cassius
 if we do meet again why we shall smile
 if not why then this parting was well made
cassius for ever and for ever farewell brutus
 if we do meet again we'll smile indeed
 if not tis true this parting was well made
brutus why then lead on o that a man might know
 the end of this day's business ere it come
 but it sufficeth that the day will end
 and then the end is known come ho away
 exeunt
 julius caesar
act v
scene ii the same the field of battle
 alarum enter brutus and messala
brutus ride ride messala ride and give these bills
 unto the legions on the other side
 loud alarum
 let them set on at once for i perceive
 but cold demeanor in octavius wing
 and sudden push gives them the overthrow
 ride ride messala let them all come down
 exeunt
 julius caesar
act v
scene iii another part of the field
 alarums enter cassius and titinius
cassius o look titinius look the villains fly
 myself have to mine own turn'd enemy
 this ensign here of mine was turning back
 i slew the coward and did take it from him
titinius o cassius brutus gave the word too early
 who having some advantage on octavius
 took it too eagerly his soldiers fell to spoil
 whilst we by antony are all enclosed
 enter pindarus
pindarus fly further off my lord fly further off
 mark antony is in your tents my lord
 fly therefore noble cassius fly far off
cassius this hill is far enough look look titinius
 are those my tents where i perceive the fire
titinius they are my lord
cassius titinius if thou lovest me
 mount thou my horse and hide thy spurs in him
 till he have brought thee up to yonder troops
 and here again that i may rest assured
 whether yond troops are friend or enemy
titinius i will be here again even with a thought
 exit
cassius go pindarus get higher on that hill
 my sight was ever thick regard titinius
 and tell me what thou notest about the field
 pindarus ascends the hill
 this day i breathed first time is come round
 and where i did begin there shall i end
 my life is run his compass sirrah what news
pindarus above o my lord
cassius what news
pindarus above titinius is enclosed round about
 with horsemen that make to him on the spur
 yet he spurs on now they are almost on him
 now titinius now some light o he lights too
 he's ta'en
 shout
 and hark they shout for joy
cassius come down behold no more
 o coward that i am to live so long
 to see my best friend ta'en before my face
 pindarus descends
 come hither sirrah
 in parthia did i take thee prisoner
 and then i swore thee saving of thy life
 that whatsoever i did bid thee do
 thou shouldst attempt it come now keep thine oath
 now be a freeman and with this good sword
 that ran through caesar's bowels search this bosom
 stand not to answer here take thou the hilts
 and when my face is cover'd as tis now
 guide thou the sword
 pindarus stabs him
 caesar thou art revenged
 even with the sword that kill'd thee
 dies
pindarus so i am free yet would not so have been
 durst i have done my will o cassius
 far from this country pindarus shall run
 where never roman shall take note of him
 exit
 reenter titinius with messala
messala it is but change titinius for octavius
 is overthrown by noble brutus power
 as cassius legions are by antony
titinius these tidings will well comfort cassius
messala where did you leave him
titinius all disconsolate
 with pindarus his bondman on this hill
messala is not that he that lies upon the ground
titinius he lies not like the living o my heart
messala is not that he
titinius no this was he messala
 but cassius is no more o setting sun
 as in thy red rays thou dost sink tonight
