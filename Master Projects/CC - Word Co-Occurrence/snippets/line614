 colour her working with such deadly wounds
 nor could the noble mortimer
 receive so many and all willingly
 then let not him be slander'd with revolt
king henry iv thou dost belie him percy thou dost belie him
 he never did encounter with glendower
 i tell thee
 he durst as well have met the devil alone
 as owen glendower for an enemy
 art thou not ashamed but sirrah henceforth
 let me not hear you speak of mortimer
 send me your prisoners with the speediest means
 or you shall hear in such a kind from me
 as will displease you my lord northumberland
 we licence your departure with your son
 send us your prisoners or you will hear of it
 exeunt king henry blunt and train
hotspur an if the devil come and roar for them
 i will not send them i will after straight
 and tell him so for i will ease my heart
 albeit i make a hazard of my head
northumberland what drunk with choler stay and pause awhile
 here comes your uncle
 reenter worcester
hotspur speak of mortimer
 zounds i will speak of him and let my soul
 want mercy if i do not join with him
 yea on his part i'll empty all these veins
 and shed my dear blood drop by drop in the dust
 but i will lift the downtrod mortimer
 as high in the air as this unthankful king
 as this ingrate and canker'd bolingbroke
northumberland brother the king hath made your nephew mad
earl of worcester who struck this heat up after i was gone
hotspur he will forsooth have all my prisoners
 and when i urged the ransom once again
 of my wife's brother then his cheek look'd pale
 and on my face he turn'd an eye of death
 trembling even at the name of mortimer
earl of worcester i cannot blame him was not he proclaim'd
 by richard that dead is the next of blood
northumberland he was i heard the proclamation
 and then it was when the unhappy king
 whose wrongs in us god pardondid set forth
 upon his irish expedition
 from whence he intercepted did return
 to be deposed and shortly murdered
earl of worcester and for whose death we in the world's wide mouth
 live scandalized and foully spoken of
hotspur but soft i pray you did king richard then
 proclaim my brother edmund mortimer
 heir to the crown
northumberland he did myself did hear it
hotspur nay then i cannot blame his cousin king
 that wished him on the barren mountains starve
 but shall it be that you that set the crown
 upon the head of this forgetful man
 and for his sake wear the detested blot
 of murderous subornation shall it be
 that you a world of curses undergo
 being the agents or base second means
 the cords the ladder or the hangman rather
 o pardon me that i descend so low
 to show the line and the predicament
 wherein you range under this subtle king
 shall it for shame be spoken in these days
 or fill up chronicles in time to come
 that men of your nobility and power
 did gage them both in an unjust behalf
 as both of yougod pardon ithave done
 to put down richard that sweet lovely rose
 an plant this thorn this canker bolingbroke
 and shall it in more shame be further spoken
 that you are fool'd discarded and shook off
 by him for whom these shames ye underwent
 no yet time serves wherein you may redeem
 your banish'd honours and restore yourselves
 into the good thoughts of the world again
 revenge the jeering and disdain'd contempt
 of this proud king who studies day and night
 to answer all the debt he owes to you
 even with the bloody payment of your deaths
 therefore i say
earl of worcester peace cousin say no more
 and now i will unclasp a secret book
 and to your quickconceiving discontents
 i'll read you matter deep and dangerous
 as full of peril and adventurous spirit
 as to o'erwalk a current roaring loud
 on the unsteadfast footing of a spear
hotspur if he fall in good night or sink or swim
 send danger from the east unto the west
 so honour cross it from the north to south
 and let them grapple o the blood more stirs
 to rouse a lion than to start a hare
northumberland imagination of some great exploit
 drives him beyond the bounds of patience
hotspur by heaven methinks it were an easy leap
 to pluck bright honour from the palefaced moon
 or dive into the bottom of the deep
 where fathomline could never touch the ground
 and pluck up drowned honour by the locks
 so he that doth redeem her thence might wear
 without corrival all her dignities
 but out upon this halffaced fellowship
earl of worcester he apprehends a world of figures here
 but not the form of what he should attend
 good cousin give me audience for a while
hotspur i cry you mercy
earl of worcester those same noble scots
 that are your prisoners
hotspur i'll keep them all
 by god he shall not have a scot of them
 no if a scot would save his soul he shall not
 i'll keep them by this hand
earl of worcester you start away
 and lend no ear unto my purposes
 those prisoners you shall keep
hotspur nay i will that's flat
 he said he would not ransom mortimer
 forbad my tongue to speak of mortimer
 but i will find him when he lies asleep
 and in his ear i'll holla mortimer'
 nay
 i'll have a starling shall be taught to speak
 nothing but mortimer and give it him
 to keep his anger still in motion
earl of worcester hear you cousin a word
hotspur all studies here i solemnly defy
 save how to gall and pinch this bolingbroke
 and that same swordandbuckler prince of wales
 but that i think his father loves him not
 and would be glad he met with some mischance
 i would have him poison'd with a pot of ale
earl of worcester farewell kinsman i'll talk to you
 when you are better temper'd to attend
northumberland why what a waspstung and impatient fool
 art thou to break into this woman's mood
 tying thine ear to no tongue but thine own
hotspur why look you i am whipp'd and scourged with rods
 nettled and stung with pismires when i hear
 of this vile politician bolingbroke
 in richard's timewhat do you call the place
 a plague upon it it is in gloucestershire
 twas where the madcap duke his uncle kept
 his uncle york where i first bow'd my knee
 unto this king of smiles this bolingbroke
 sblood
 when you and he came back from ravenspurgh
northumberland at berkley castle
hotspur you say true
 why what a candy deal of courtesy
 this fawning greyhound then did proffer me
 look'when his infant fortune came to age'
 and gentle harry percy and kind cousin'
 o the devil take such cozeners god forgive me
 good uncle tell your tale i have done
earl of worcester nay if you have not to it again
 we will stay your leisure
hotspur i have done i faith
earl of worcester then once more to your scottish prisoners
 deliver them up without their ransom straight
 and make the douglas son your only mean
 for powers in scotland which for divers reasons
 which i shall send you written be assured
 will easily be granted you my lord
 to northumberland
 your son in scotland being thus employ'd
 shall secretly into the bosom creep
 of that same noble prelate well beloved
 the archbishop
hotspur of york is it not
earl of worcester true who bears hard
 his brother's death at bristol the lord scroop
 i speak not this in estimation
 as what i think might be but what i know
 is ruminated plotted and set down
 and only stays but to behold the face
 of that occasion that shall bring it on
hotspur i smell it upon my life it will do well
northumberland before the game is afoot thou still let'st slip
hotspur why it cannot choose but be a noble plot
 and then the power of scotland and of york
 to join with mortimer ha
earl of worcester and so they shall
hotspur in faith it is exceedingly well aim'd
earl of worcester and tis no little reason bids us speed
 to save our heads by raising of a head
 for bear ourselves as even as we can
 the king will always think him in our debt
 and think we think ourselves unsatisfied
 till he hath found a time to pay us home
 and see already how he doth begin
 to make us strangers to his looks of love
hotspur he does he does we'll be revenged on him
earl of worcester cousin farewell no further go in this
 than i by letters shall direct your course
 when time is ripe which will be suddenly
 i'll steal to glendower and lord mortimer
 where you and douglas and our powers at once
