praise him with the timbrel and dance praise him with stringed instruments and organs
praise him upon the loud cymbals praise him upon the high sounding cymbals
let every thing that hath breath praise the lord praise ye the lord
the proverbs of solomon the son of david king of israel
to know wisdom and instruction to perceive the words of understanding
to receive the instruction of wisdom justice and judgment and equity
to give subtilty to the simple to the young man knowledge and discretion
a wise man will hear and will increase learning and a man of understanding shall attain unto wise counsels
to understand a proverb and the interpretation the words of the wise and their dark sayings
the fear of the lord is the beginning of knowledge but fools despise wisdom and instruction
my son hear the instruction of thy father and forsake not the law of thy mother
for they shall be an ornament of grace unto thy head and chains about thy neck
my son if sinners entice thee consent thou not
if they say come with us let us lay wait for blood let us lurk privily for the innocent without cause
let us swallow them up alive as the grave and whole as those that go down into the pit
we shall find all precious substance we shall fill our houses with spoil
cast in thy lot among us let us all have one purse
my son walk not thou in the way with them refrain thy foot from their path
for their feet run to evil and make haste to shed blood
surely in vain the net is spread in the sight of any bird
and they lay wait for their own blood they lurk privily for their own lives
so are the ways of every one that is greedy of gain which taketh away the life of the owners thereof
wisdom crieth without she uttereth her voice in the streets
she crieth in the chief place of concourse in the openings of the gates in the city she uttereth her words saying
how long ye simple ones will ye love simplicity and the scorners delight in their scorning and fools hate knowledge
turn you at my reproof behold i will pour out my spirit unto you i will make known my words unto you
because i have called and ye refused i have stretched out my hand and no man regarded
but ye have set at nought all my counsel and would none of my reproof
i also will laugh at your calamity i will mock when your fear cometh
when your fear cometh as desolation and your destruction cometh as a whirlwind when distress and anguish cometh upon you
then shall they call upon me but i will not answer they shall seek me early but they shall not find me
for that they hated knowledge and did not choose the fear of the lord
they would none of my counsel they despised all my reproof
therefore shall they eat of the fruit of their own way and be filled with their own devices
for the turning away of the simple shall slay them and the prosperity of fools shall destroy them
but whoso hearkeneth unto me shall dwell safely and shall be quiet from fear of evil
my son if thou wilt receive my words and hide my commandments with thee
so that thou incline thine ear unto wisdom and apply thine heart to understanding
yea if thou criest after knowledge and liftest up thy voice for understanding
if thou seekest her as silver and searchest for her as for hid treasures
then shalt thou understand the fear of the lord and find the knowledge of god
for the lord giveth wisdom out of his mouth cometh knowledge and understanding
he layeth up sound wisdom for the righteous he is a buckler to them that walk uprightly
he keepeth the paths of judgment and preserveth the way of his saints
then shalt thou understand righteousness and judgment and equity yea every good path
when wisdom entereth into thine heart and knowledge is pleasant unto thy soul
discretion shall preserve thee understanding shall keep thee
to deliver thee from the way of the evil man from the man that speaketh froward things
who leave the paths of uprightness to walk in the ways of darkness
who rejoice to do evil and delight in the frowardness of the wicked
whose ways are crooked and they froward in their paths
to deliver thee from the strange woman even from the stranger which flattereth with her words
which forsaketh the guide of her youth and forgetteth the covenant of her god
for her house inclineth unto death and her paths unto the dead
none that go unto her return again neither take they hold of the paths of life
that thou mayest walk in the way of good men and keep the paths of the righteous
for the upright shall dwell in the land and the perfect shall remain in it
but the wicked shall be cut off from the earth and the transgressors shall be rooted out of it
my son forget not my law but let thine heart keep my commandments
for length of days and long life and peace shall they add to thee
let not mercy and truth forsake thee bind them about thy neck write them upon the table of thine heart
so shalt thou find favour and good understanding in the sight of god and man
trust in the lord with all thine heart and lean not unto thine own understanding
in all thy ways acknowledge him and he shall direct thy paths
be not wise in thine own eyes fear the lord and depart from evil
it shall be health to thy navel and marrow to thy bones
honour the lord with thy substance and with the firstfruits of all thine increase
so shall thy barns be filled with plenty and thy presses shall burst out with new wine
my son despise not the chastening of the lord neither be weary of his correction
for whom the lord loveth he correcteth even as a father the son in whom he delighteth
happy is the man that findeth wisdom and the man that getteth understanding
for the merchandise of it is better than the merchandise of silver and the gain thereof than fine gold
she is more precious than rubies and all the things thou canst desire are not to be compared unto her
length of days is in her right hand and in her left hand riches and honour
her ways are ways of pleasantness and all her paths are peace
she is a tree of life to them that lay hold upon her and happy is every one that retaineth her
the lord by wisdom hath founded the earth by understanding hath he established the heavens
by his knowledge the depths are broken up and the clouds drop down the dew
my son let not them depart from thine eyes keep sound wisdom and discretion
so shall they be life unto thy soul and grace to thy neck
then shalt thou walk in thy way safely and thy foot shall not stumble
when thou liest down thou shalt not be afraid yea thou shalt lie down and thy sleep shall be sweet
be not afraid of sudden fear neither of the desolation of the wicked when it cometh
for the lord shall be thy confidence and shall keep thy foot from being taken
withhold not good from them to whom it is due when it is in the power of thine hand to do it
say not unto thy neighbour go and come again and to morrow i will give when thou hast it by thee
devise not evil against thy neighbour seeing he dwelleth securely by thee
strive not with a man without cause if he have done thee no harm
envy thou not the oppressor and choose none of his ways
for the froward is abomination to the lord but his secret is with the righteous
the curse of the lord is in the house of the wicked but he blesseth the habitation of the just
surely he scorneth the scorners but he giveth grace unto the lowly
the wise shall inherit glory but shame shall be the promotion of fools
hear ye children the instruction of a father and attend to know understanding
for i give you good doctrine forsake ye not my law
for i was my father's son tender and only beloved in the sight of my mother
he taught me also and said unto me let thine heart retain my words keep my commandments and live
get wisdom get understanding forget it not neither decline from the words of my mouth
forsake her not and she shall preserve thee love her and she shall keep thee
wisdom is the principal thing therefore get wisdom and with all thy getting get understanding
exalt her and she shall promote thee she shall bring thee to honour when thou dost embrace her
she shall give to thine head an ornament of grace a crown of glory shall she deliver to thee
hear o my son and receive my sayings and the years of thy life shall be many
i have taught thee in the way of wisdom i have led thee in right paths
when thou goest thy steps shall not be straitened and when thou runnest thou shalt not stumble
take fast hold of instruction let her not go keep her for she is thy life
enter not into the path of the wicked and go not in the way of evil men
avoid it pass not by it turn from it and pass away
for they sleep not except they have done mischief and their sleep is taken away unless they cause some to fall
for they eat the bread of wickedness and drink the wine of violence
but the path of the just is as the shining light that shineth more and more unto the perfect day
the way of the wicked is as darkness they know not at what they stumble
my son attend to my words incline thine ear unto my sayings
let them not depart from thine eyes keep them in the midst of thine heart
for they are life unto those that find them and health to all their flesh
keep thy heart with all diligence for out of it are the issues of life
put away from thee a froward mouth and perverse lips put far from thee
let thine eyes look right on and let thine eyelids look straight before thee
ponder the path of thy feet and let all thy ways be established
turn not to the right hand nor to the left remove thy foot from evil
my son attend unto my wisdom and bow thine ear to my understanding
that thou mayest regard discretion and that thy lips may keep knowledge
for the lips of a strange woman drop as an honeycomb and her mouth is smoother than oil
but her end is bitter as wormwood sharp as a twoedged sword
her feet go down to death her steps take hold on hell
lest thou shouldest ponder the path of life her ways are moveable that thou canst not know them
hear me now therefore o ye children and depart not from the words of my mouth
remove thy way far from her and come not nigh the door of her house
lest thou give thine honour unto others and thy years unto the cruel
lest strangers be filled with thy wealth and thy labours be in the house of a stranger
and thou mourn at the last when thy flesh and thy body are consumed
and say how have i hated instruction and my heart despised reproof
and have not obeyed the voice of my teachers nor inclined mine ear to them that instructed me
i was almost in all evil in the midst of the congregation and assembly
drink waters out of thine own cistern and running waters out of thine own well
let thy fountains be dispersed abroad and rivers of waters in the streets
let them be only thine own and not strangers with thee
let thy fountain be blessed and rejoice with the wife of thy youth
let her be as the loving hind and pleasant roe let her breasts satisfy thee at all times and be thou ravished always with her love
and why wilt thou my son be ravished with a strange woman and embrace the bosom of a stranger
for the ways of man are before the eyes of the lord and he pondereth all his goings
his own iniquities shall take the wicked himself and he shall be holden with the cords of his sins
he shall die without instruction and in the greatness of his folly he shall go astray
my son if thou be surety for thy friend if thou hast stricken thy hand with a stranger
thou art snared with the words of thy mouth thou art taken with the words of thy mouth
do this now my son and deliver thyself when thou art come into the hand of thy friend go humble thyself and make sure thy friend
give not sleep to thine eyes nor slumber to thine eyelids
deliver thyself as a roe from the hand of the hunter and as a bird from the hand of the fowler
go to the ant thou sluggard consider her ways and be wise
which having no guide overseer or ruler
provideth her meat in the summer and gathereth her food in the harvest
how long wilt thou sleep o sluggard when wilt thou arise out of thy sleep
yet a little sleep a little slumber a little folding of the hands to sleep
so shall thy poverty come as one that travelleth and thy want as an armed man
a naughty person a wicked man walketh with a froward mouth
he winketh with his eyes he speaketh with his feet he teacheth with his fingers
frowardness is in his heart he deviseth mischief continually he soweth discord
therefore shall his calamity come suddenly suddenly shall he be broken without remedy
these six things doth the lord hate yea seven are an abomination unto him
a proud look a lying tongue and hands that shed innocent blood
an heart that deviseth wicked imaginations feet that be swift in running to mischief
a false witness that speaketh lies and he that soweth discord among brethren
my son keep thy father's commandment and forsake not the law of thy mother
bind them continually upon thine heart and tie them about thy neck
when thou goest it shall lead thee when thou sleepest it shall keep thee and when thou awakest it shall talk with thee
for the commandment is a lamp and the law is light and reproofs of instruction are the way of life
to keep thee from the evil woman from the flattery of the tongue of a strange woman
lust not after her beauty in thine heart neither let her take thee with her eyelids
for by means of a whorish woman a man is brought to a piece of bread and the adulteress will hunt for the precious life
can a man take fire in his bosom and his clothes not be burned
can one go upon hot coals and his feet not be burned
so he that goeth in to his neighbour's wife whosoever toucheth her shall not be innocent
men do not despise a thief if he steal to satisfy his soul when he is hungry
but if he be found he shall restore sevenfold he shall give all the substance of his house
but whoso committeth adultery with a woman lacketh understanding he that doeth it destroyeth his own soul
a wound and dishonour shall he get and his reproach shall not be wiped away
for jealousy is the rage of a man therefore he will not spare in the day of vengeance
he will not regard any ransom neither will he rest content though thou givest many gifts
my son keep my words and lay up my commandments with thee
keep my commandments and live and my law as the apple of thine eye
bind them upon thy fingers write them upon the table of thine heart
say unto wisdom thou art my sister and call understanding thy kinswoman
that they may keep thee from the strange woman from the stranger which flattereth with her words
for at the window of my house i looked through my casement
and beheld among the simple ones i discerned among the youths a young man void of understanding
passing through the street near her corner and he went the way to her house
in the twilight in the evening in the black and dark night
and behold there met him a woman with the attire of an harlot and subtil of heart
she is loud and stubborn her feet abide not in her house
now is she without now in the streets and lieth in wait at every corner
so she caught him and kissed him and with an impudent face said unto him
i have peace offerings with me this day have i payed my vows
therefore came i forth to meet thee diligently to seek thy face and i have found thee
i have decked my bed with coverings of tapestry with carved works with fine linen of egypt
i have perfumed my bed with myrrh aloes and cinnamon
come let us take our fill of love until the morning let us solace ourselves with loves
for the goodman is not at home he is gone a long journey
he hath taken a bag of money with him and will come home at the day appointed
with her much fair speech she caused him to yield with the flattering of her lips she forced him
he goeth after her straightway as an ox goeth to the slaughter or as a fool to the correction of the stocks
