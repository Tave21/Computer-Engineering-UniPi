 to see fair padua nursery of arts
 i am arrived for fruitful lombardy
 the pleasant garden of great italy
 and by my father's love and leave am arm'd
 with his good will and thy good company
 my trusty servant well approved in all
 here let us breathe and haply institute
 a course of learning and ingenious studies
 pisa renown'd for grave citizens
 gave me my being and my father first
 a merchant of great traffic through the world
 vincetino come of bentivolii
 vincetino's son brought up in florence
 it shall become to serve all hopes conceived
 to deck his fortune with his virtuous deeds
 and therefore tranio for the time i study
 virtue and that part of philosophy
 will i apply that treats of happiness
 by virtue specially to be achieved
 tell me thy mind for i have pisa left
 and am to padua come as he that leaves
 a shallow plash to plunge him in the deep
 and with satiety seeks to quench his thirst
tranio mi perdonato gentle master mine
 i am in all affected as yourself
 glad that you thus continue your resolve
 to suck the sweets of sweet philosophy
 only good master while we do admire
 this virtue and this moral discipline
 let's be no stoics nor no stocks i pray
 or so devote to aristotle's cheques
 as ovid be an outcast quite abjured
 balk logic with acquaintance that you have
 and practise rhetoric in your common talk
 music and poesy use to quicken you
 the mathematics and the metaphysics
 fall to them as you find your stomach serves you
 no profit grows where is no pleasure ta'en
 in brief sir study what you most affect
lucentio gramercies tranio well dost thou advise
 if biondello thou wert come ashore
 we could at once put us in readiness
 and take a lodging fit to entertain
 such friends as time in padua shall beget
 but stay a while what company is this
tranio master some show to welcome us to town
 enter baptista katharina bianca gremio and
 hortensio lucentio and tranio stand by
baptista gentlemen importune me no farther
 for how i firmly am resolved you know
 that is not bestow my youngest daughter
 before i have a husband for the elder
 if either of you both love katharina
 because i know you well and love you well
 leave shall you have to court her at your pleasure
gremio aside to cart her rather she's too rough for me
 there there hortensio will you any wife
katharina i pray you sir is it your will
 to make a stale of me amongst these mates
hortensio mates maid how mean you that no mates for you
 unless you were of gentler milder mould
katharina i'faith sir you shall never need to fear
 i wis it is not half way to her heart
 but if it were doubt not her care should be
 to comb your noddle with a threelegg'd stool
 and paint your face and use you like a fool
hortensia from all such devils good lord deliver us
gremio and me too good lord
tranio hush master here's some good pastime toward
 that wench is stark mad or wonderful froward
lucentio but in the other's silence do i see
 maid's mild behavior and sobriety
 peace tranio

baptista gentlemen that i may soon make good
 what i have said bianca get you in
 and let it not displease thee good bianca
 for i will love thee ne'er the less my girl

 on them to took and practise by myself

 bianca's grief
gremio why will you mew her up
 signior baptista for this fiend of hell
 and make her bear the penance of her tongue
baptista gentlemen content ye i am resolved
 go in bianca
 exit bianca
 and for i know she taketh most delight
 in music instruments and poetry
 schoolmasters will i keep within my house
 fit to instruct her youth if you hortensio
 or signior gremio you know any such
 prefer them hither for to cunning men
 i will be very kind and liberal
 to mine own children in good bringing up
 and so farewell katharina you may stay
 for i have more to commune with bianca
 exit
katharina why and i trust i may go too may i not what
 shall i be appointed hours as though belike i
 knew not what to take and what to leave ha
 exit
gremio you may go to the devil's dam your gifts are so
 good here's none will hold you their love is not
 so great hortensio but we may blow our nails
 together and fast it fairly out our cakes dough on
 both sides farewell yet for the love i bear my
 sweet bianca if i can by any means light on a fit
 man to teach her that wherein she delights i will
 wish him to her father
hortensio so will i signior gremio but a word i pray
 though the nature of our quarrel yet never brooked
 parle know now upon advice it toucheth us both
 that we may yet again have access to our fair
 mistress and be happy rivals in bianco's love to
 labour and effect one thing specially
gremio what's that i pray
hortensio marry sir to get a husband for her sister
gremio a husband a devil
hortensio i say a husband
gremio i say a devil thinkest thou hortensio though
 her father be very rich any man is so very a fool
 to be married to hell
hortensio tush gremio though it pass your patience and mine
 to endure her loud alarums why man there be good
 fellows in the world an a man could light on them
 would take her with all faults and money enough
gremio i cannot tell but i had as lief take her dowry with
 this condition to be whipped at the high cross
 every morning
hortensio faith as you say there's small choice in rotten
 apples but come since this bar in law makes us
 friends it shall be so far forth friendly
 maintained all by helping baptista's eldest daughter
 to a husband we set his youngest free for a husband
 and then have to't a fresh sweet bianca happy man
 be his dole he that runs fastest gets the ring
 how say you signior gremio
gremio i am agreed and would i had given him the best
 horse in padua to begin his wooing that would
 thoroughly woo her wed her and bed her and rid the
 house of her come on
 exeunt gremio and hortensio
tranio i pray sir tell me is it possible
 that love should of a sudden take such hold
lucentio o tranio till i found it to be true
 i never thought it possible or likely
 but see while idly i stood looking on
 i found the effect of love in idleness
 and now in plainness do confess to thee
 that art to me as secret and as dear
 as anna to the queen of carthage was
 tranio i burn i pine i perish tranio
 if i achieve not this young modest girl
 counsel me tranio for i know thou canst
 assist me tranio for i know thou wilt
tranio master it is no time to chide you now
 affection is not rated from the heart
 if love have touch'd you nought remains but so
 redime te captum quam queas minimo'
lucentio gramercies lad go forward this contents
 the rest will comfort for thy counsel's sound
tranio master you look'd so longly on the maid
 perhaps you mark'd not what's the pith of all
lucentio o yes i saw sweet beauty in her face
 such as the daughter of agenor had
 that made great jove to humble him to her hand
 when with his knees he kiss'd the cretan strand
tranio saw you no more mark'd you not how her sister
 began to scold and raise up such a storm
 that mortal ears might hardly endure the din
lucentio tranio i saw her coral lips to move
 and with her breath she did perfume the air
 sacred and sweet was all i saw in her
tranio nay then tis time to stir him from his trance
 i pray awake sir if you love the maid
 bend thoughts and wits to achieve her thus it stands
 her eldest sister is so curst and shrewd
 that till the father rid his hands of her
 master your love must live a maid at home
 and therefore has he closely mew'd her up
 because she will not be annoy'd with suitors
lucentio ah tranio what a cruel father's he
 but art thou not advised he took some care
 to get her cunning schoolmasters to instruct her
tranio ay marry am i sir and now tis plotted
lucentio i have it tranio
tranio master for my hand
 both our inventions meet and jump in one
lucentio tell me thine first
tranio you will be schoolmaster
 and undertake the teaching of the maid
 that's your device
