 tie leaden pounds to's heels proceed by process
 lest parties as he is beloved break out
 and sack great rome with romans
brutus if it were so
sicinius what do ye talk
 have we not had a taste of his obedience
 our aediles smote ourselves resisted come
menenius consider this he has been bred i the wars
 since he could draw a sword and is ill school'd
 in bolted language meal and bran together
 he throws without distinction give me leave
 i'll go to him and undertake to bring him
 where he shall answer by a lawful form
 in peace to his utmost peril
first senator noble tribunes
 it is the humane way the other course
 will prove too bloody and the end of it
 unknown to the beginning
sicinius noble menenius
 be you then as the people's officer
 masters lay down your weapons
brutus go not home
sicinius meet on the marketplace we'll attend you there
 where if you bring not marcius we'll proceed
 in our first way
menenius i'll bring him to you
 to the senators
 let me desire your company he must come
 or what is worst will follow
first senator pray you let's to him
 exeunt
 coriolanus
act iii
scene ii a room in coriolanus's house
 enter coriolanus with patricians
coriolanus let them puff all about mine ears present me
 death on the wheel or at wild horses heels
 or pile ten hills on the tarpeian rock
 that the precipitation might down stretch
 below the beam of sight yet will i still
 be thus to them
a patrician you do the nobler
coriolanus i muse my mother
 does not approve me further who was wont
 to call them woollen vassals things created
 to buy and sell with groats to show bare heads
 in congregations to yawn be still and wonder
 when one but of my ordinance stood up
 to speak of peace or war
 enter volumnia
 i talk of you
 why did you wish me milder would you have me
 false to my nature rather say i play
 the man i am
volumnia o sir sir sir
 i would have had you put your power well on
 before you had worn it out
coriolanus let go
volumnia you might have been enough the man you are
 with striving less to be so lesser had been
 the thwartings of your dispositions if
 you had not show'd them how ye were disposed
 ere they lack'd power to cross you
coriolanus let them hang
a patrician ay and burn too
 enter menenius and senators
menenius come come you have been too rough something
 too rough
 you must return and mend it
first senator there's no remedy
 unless by not so doing our good city
 cleave in the midst and perish
volumnia pray be counsell'd
 i have a heart as little apt as yours
 but yet a brain that leads my use of anger
 to better vantage
menenius well said noble woman
 before he should thus stoop to the herd but that
 the violent fit o the time craves it as physic
 for the whole state i would put mine armour on
 which i can scarcely bear
coriolanus what must i do
menenius return to the tribunes
coriolanus well what then what then
menenius repent what you have spoke
coriolanus for them i cannot do it to the gods
 must i then do't to them
volumnia you are too absolute
 though therein you can never be too noble
 but when extremities speak i have heard you say
 honour and policy like unsever'd friends
 i the war do grow together grant that and tell me
 in peace what each of them by the other lose
 that they combine not there
coriolanus tush tush
menenius a good demand
volumnia if it be honour in your wars to seem
 the same you are not which for your best ends
 you adopt your policy how is it less or worse
 that it shall hold companionship in peace
 with honour as in war since that to both
 it stands in like request
coriolanus why force you this
volumnia because that now it lies you on to speak
 to the people not by your own instruction
 nor by the matter which your heart prompts you
 but with such words that are but rooted in
 your tongue though but bastards and syllables
 of no allowance to your bosom's truth
 now this no more dishonours you at all
 than to take in a town with gentle words
 which else would put you to your fortune and
 the hazard of much blood
 i would dissemble with my nature where
 my fortunes and my friends at stake required
 i should do so in honour i am in this
 your wife your son these senators the nobles
 and you will rather show our general louts
 how you can frown than spend a fawn upon em
 for the inheritance of their loves and safeguard
 of what that want might ruin
menenius noble lady
 come go with us speak fair you may salve so
 not what is dangerous present but the loss
 of what is past
volumnia i prithee now my son
 go to them with this bonnet in thy hand
 and thus far having stretch'd ithere be with them
 thy knee bussing the stonesfor in such business
 action is eloquence and the eyes of the ignorant
 more learned than the earswaving thy head
 which often thus correcting thy stout heart
 now humble as the ripest mulberry
 that will not hold the handling or say to them
 thou art their soldier and being bred in broils
 hast not the soft way which thou dost confess
 were fit for thee to use as they to claim
 in asking their good loves but thou wilt frame
 thyself forsooth hereafter theirs so far
 as thou hast power and person
menenius this but done
 even as she speaks why their hearts were yours
 for they have pardons being ask'd as free
 as words to little purpose
volumnia prithee now
 go and be ruled although i know thou hadst rather
 follow thine enemy in a fiery gulf
 than flatter him in a bower here is cominius
 enter cominius
cominius i have been i the marketplace and sir'tis fit
 you make strong party or defend yourself
 by calmness or by absence all's in anger
menenius only fair speech
cominius i think twill serve if he
 can thereto frame his spirit
volumnia he must and will
 prithee now say you will and go about it
coriolanus must i go show them my unbarbed sconce
 must i with base tongue give my noble heart
 a lie that it must bear well i will do't
 yet were there but this single plot to lose
 this mould of marcius they to dust should grind it
 and throw't against the wind to the marketplace
 you have put me now to such a part which never
 i shall discharge to the life
cominius come come we'll prompt you
volumnia i prithee now sweet son as thou hast said
 my praises made thee first a soldier so
 to have my praise for this perform a part
 thou hast not done before
coriolanus well i must do't
 away my disposition and possess me
 some harlot's spirit my throat of war be turn'd
 which quired with my drum into a pipe
 small as an eunuch or the virgin voice
 that babies lulls asleep the smiles of knaves
 tent in my cheeks and schoolboys tears take up
 the glasses of my sight a beggar's tongue
 make motion through my lips and my arm'd knees
 who bow'd but in my stirrup bend like his
 that hath received an alms i will not do't
 lest i surcease to honour mine own truth
 and by my body's action teach my mind
 a most inherent baseness
volumnia at thy choice then
 to beg of thee it is my more dishonour
 than thou of them come all to ruin let
 thy mother rather feel thy pride than fear
 thy dangerous stoutness for i mock at death
 with as big heart as thou do as thou list
 thy valiantness was mine thou suck'dst it from me
 but owe thy pride thyself
coriolanus pray be content
 mother i am going to the marketplace
 chide me no more i'll mountebank their loves
 cog their hearts from them and come home beloved
 of all the trades in rome look i am going
 commend me to my wife i'll return consul
 or never trust to what my tongue can do
 i the way of flattery further
