 his gracious pleasure any way therein
 but you my noble lords may name the time
 and in the duke's behalf i'll give my voice
 which i presume he'll take in gentle part
 enter gloucester
bishop of ely now in good time here comes the duke himself
gloucester my noble lords and cousins all good morrow
 i have been long a sleeper but i hope
 my absence doth neglect no great designs
 which by my presence might have been concluded
buckingham had not you come upon your cue my lord
 william lord hastings had pronounced your part
 i mean your voicefor crowning of the king
gloucester than my lord hastings no man might be bolder
 his lordship knows me well and loves me well
hastings i thank your grace
gloucester my lord of ely
bishop of ely my lord
gloucester when i was last in holborn
 i saw good strawberries in your garden there
 i do beseech you send for some of them
bishop of ely marry and will my lord with all my heart
 exit
gloucester cousin of buckingham a word with you
 drawing him aside
 catesby hath sounded hastings in our business
 and finds the testy gentleman so hot
 as he will lose his head ere give consent
 his master's son as worshipful as he terms it
 shall lose the royalty of england's throne
buckingham withdraw you hence my lord i'll follow you
 exit gloucester buckingham following
derby we have not yet set down this day of triumph
 tomorrow in mine opinion is too sudden
 for i myself am not so well provided
 as else i would be were the day prolong'd
 reenter bishop of ely
bishop of ely where is my lord protector i have sent for these
 strawberries
hastings his grace looks cheerfully and smooth today
 there's some conceit or other likes him well
 when he doth bid good morrow with such a spirit
 i think there's never a man in christendom
 that can less hide his love or hate than he
 for by his face straight shall you know his heart
derby what of his heart perceive you in his face
 by any likelihood he show'd today
hastings marry that with no man here he is offended
 for were he he had shown it in his looks
derby i pray god he be not i say
 reenter gloucester and buckingham
gloucester i pray you all tell me what they deserve
 that do conspire my death with devilish plots
 of damned witchcraft and that have prevail'd
 upon my body with their hellish charms
hastings the tender love i bear your grace my lord
 makes me most forward in this noble presence
 to doom the offenders whatsoever they be
 i say my lord they have deserved death
gloucester then be your eyes the witness of this ill
 see how i am bewitch'd behold mine arm
 is like a blasted sapling wither'd up
 and this is edward's wife that monstrous witch
 consorted with that harlot strumpet shore
 that by their witchcraft thus have marked me
hastings if they have done this thing my gracious lord
gloucester if i thou protector of this damned strumpet
 tellest thou me of ifs thou art a traitor
 off with his head now by saint paul i swear
 i will not dine until i see the same
 lovel and ratcliff look that it be done
 the rest that love me rise and follow me
 exeunt all but hastings ratcliff and lovel
hastings woe woe for england not a whit for me
 for i too fond might have prevented this
 stanley did dream the boar did raze his helm
 but i disdain'd it and did scorn to fly
 three times today my footcloth horse did stumble
 and startled when he look'd upon the tower
 as loath to bear me to the slaughterhouse
 o now i want the priest that spake to me
 i now repent i told the pursuivant
 as twere triumphing at mine enemies
 how they at pomfret bloodily were butcher'd
 and i myself secure in grace and favour
 o margaret margaret now thy heavy curse
 is lighted on poor hastings wretched head
ratcliff dispatch my lord the duke would be at dinner
 make a short shrift he longs to see your head
hastings o momentary grace of mortal men
 which we more hunt for than the grace of god
 who builds his hopes in air of your good looks
 lives like a drunken sailor on a mast
 ready with every nod to tumble down
 into the fatal bowels of the deep
lovel come come dispatch tis bootless to exclaim
hastings o bloody richard miserable england
 i prophesy the fearful'st time to thee
 that ever wretched age hath look'd upon
 come lead me to the block bear him my head
 they smile at me that shortly shall be dead
 exeunt
 king richard iii
act iii
scene v the towerwalls
 enter gloucester and buckingham in rotten armour
 marvellous illfavoured
gloucester come cousin canst thou quake and change thy colour
 murder thy breath in the middle of a word
 and then begin again and stop again
 as if thou wert distraught and mad with terror
buckingham tut i can counterfeit the deep tragedian
 speak and look back and pry on every side
 tremble and start at wagging of a straw
 intending deep suspicion ghastly looks
 are at my service like enforced smiles
 and both are ready in their offices
 at any time to grace my stratagems
 but what is catesby gone
gloucester he is and see he brings the mayor along
 enter the lord mayor and catesby
buckingham lord mayor
gloucester look to the drawbridge there
buckingham hark a drum
gloucester catesby o'erlook the walls
buckingham lord mayor the reason we have sent
gloucester look back defend thee here are enemies
buckingham god and our innocency defend and guard us
gloucester be patient they are friends ratcliff and lovel
 enter lovel and ratcliff with hastings head
lovel here is the head of that ignoble traitor
 the dangerous and unsuspected hastings
gloucester so dear i loved the man that i must weep
 i took him for the plainest harmless creature
 that breathed upon this earth a christian
 made him my book wherein my soul recorded
 the history of all her secret thoughts
 so smooth he daub'd his vice with show of virtue
 that his apparent open guilt omitted
 i mean his conversation with shore's wife
 he lived from all attainder of suspect
buckingham well well he was the covert'st shelter'd traitor
 that ever lived
 would you imagine or almost believe
 were't not that by great preservation
 we live to tell it you the subtle traitor
 this day had plotted in the councilhouse
 to murder me and my good lord of gloucester
lord mayor what had he so
gloucester what think you we are turks or infidels
 or that we would against the form of law
 proceed thus rashly to the villain's death
 but that the extreme peril of the case
 the peace of england and our persons safety
 enforced us to this execution
lord mayor now fair befall you he deserved his death
 and you my good lords both have well proceeded
 to warn false traitors from the like attempts
 i never look'd for better at his hands
 after he once fell in with mistress shore
gloucester yet had not we determined he should die
 until your lordship came to see his death
 which now the loving haste of these our friends
 somewhat against our meaning have prevented
 because my lord we would have had you heard
 the traitor speak and timorously confess
 the manner and the purpose of his treason
 that you might well have signified the same
 unto the citizens who haply may
 misconstrue us in him and wail his death
lord mayor but my good lord your grace's word shall serve
 as well as i had seen and heard him speak
 and doubt you not right noble princes both
 but i'll acquaint our duteous citizens
 with all your just proceedings in this cause
gloucester and to that end we wish'd your lordship here
 to avoid the carping censures of the world
buckingham but since you come too late of our intents
 yet witness what you hear we did intend
 and so my good lord mayor we bid farewell
 exit lord mayor
gloucester go after after cousin buckingham
 the mayor towards guildhall hies him in all post
 there at your meet'st advantage of the time
 infer the bastardy of edward's children
 tell them how edward put to death a citizen
 only for saying he would make his son
 heir to the crown meaning indeed his house
 which by the sign thereof was termed so
 moreover urge his hateful luxury
 and bestial appetite in change of lust
 which stretched to their servants daughters wives
 even where his lustful eye or savage heart
 without control listed to make his prey
 nay for a need thus far come near my person
 tell them when that my mother went with child
 of that unsatiate edward noble york
 my princely father then had wars in france
 and by just computation of the time
 found that the issue was not his begot
