horatio my lord i did
 but answer made it none yet once methought
 it lifted up its head and did address
 itself to motion like as it would speak
 but even then the morning cock crew loud
 and at the sound it shrunk in haste away
 and vanish'd from our sight
hamlet tis very strange
horatio as i do live my honour'd lord tis true
 and we did think it writ down in our duty
 to let you know of it
hamlet indeed indeed sirs but this troubles me
 hold you the watch tonight
marcellus 
 we do my lord
bernardo 
hamlet arm'd say you
marcellus 
 arm'd my lord
bernardo 
hamlet from top to toe
marcellus 
 my lord from head to foot
bernardo 
hamlet then saw you not his face
horatio o yes my lord he wore his beaver up
hamlet what look'd he frowningly
horatio a countenance more in sorrow than in anger
hamlet pale or red
horatio nay very pale
hamlet and fix'd his eyes upon you
horatio most constantly
hamlet i would i had been there
horatio it would have much amazed you
hamlet very like very like stay'd it long
horatio while one with moderate haste might tell a hundred
marcellus 
 longer longer
bernardo 
horatio not when i saw't
hamlet his beard was grizzledno
horatio it was as i have seen it in his life
 a sable silver'd
hamlet i will watch tonight
 perchance twill walk again
horatio i warrant it will
hamlet if it assume my noble father's person
 i'll speak to it though hell itself should gape
 and bid me hold my peace i pray you all
 if you have hitherto conceal'd this sight
 let it be tenable in your silence still
 and whatsoever else shall hap tonight
 give it an understanding but no tongue
 i will requite your loves so fare you well
 upon the platform twixt eleven and twelve
 i'll visit you
all our duty to your honour
hamlet your loves as mine to you farewell
 exeunt all but hamlet
 my father's spirit in arms all is not well
 i doubt some foul play would the night were come
 till then sit still my soul foul deeds will rise
 though all the earth o'erwhelm them to men's eyes
 exit
 hamlet
act i
scene iii a room in polonius house
 enter laertes and ophelia
laertes my necessaries are embark'd farewell
 and sister as the winds give benefit
 and convoy is assistant do not sleep
 but let me hear from you
ophelia do you doubt that
laertes for hamlet and the trifling of his favour
 hold it a fashion and a toy in blood
 a violet in the youth of primy nature
 forward not permanent sweet not lasting
 the perfume and suppliance of a minute no more
ophelia no more but so
laertes think it no more
 for nature crescent does not grow alone
 in thews and bulk but as this temple waxes
 the inward service of the mind and soul
 grows wide withal perhaps he loves you now
 and now no soil nor cautel doth besmirch
 the virtue of his will but you must fear
 his greatness weigh'd his will is not his own
 for he himself is subject to his birth
 he may not as unvalued persons do
 carve for himself for on his choice depends
 the safety and health of this whole state
 and therefore must his choice be circumscribed
 unto the voice and yielding of that body
 whereof he is the head then if he says he loves you
 it fits your wisdom so far to believe it
 as he in his particular act and place
 may give his saying deed which is no further
 than the main voice of denmark goes withal
 then weigh what loss your honour may sustain
 if with too credent ear you list his songs
 or lose your heart or your chaste treasure open
 to his unmaster'd importunity
 fear it ophelia fear it my dear sister
 and keep you in the rear of your affection
 out of the shot and danger of desire
 the chariest maid is prodigal enough
 if she unmask her beauty to the moon
 virtue itself scapes not calumnious strokes
 the canker galls the infants of the spring
 too oft before their buttons be disclosed
 and in the morn and liquid dew of youth
 contagious blastments are most imminent
 be wary then best safety lies in fear
 youth to itself rebels though none else near
ophelia i shall the effect of this good lesson keep
 as watchman to my heart but good my brother
 do not as some ungracious pastors do
 show me the steep and thorny way to heaven
 whiles like a puff'd and reckless libertine
 himself the primrose path of dalliance treads
 and recks not his own rede
laertes o fear me not
 i stay too long but here my father comes
 enter polonius
 a double blessing is a double grace
 occasion smiles upon a second leave
lord polonius yet here laertes aboard aboard for shame
 the wind sits in the shoulder of your sail
 and you are stay'd for there my blessing with thee
 and these few precepts in thy memory
 see thou character give thy thoughts no tongue
 nor any unproportioned thought his act
 be thou familiar but by no means vulgar
 those friends thou hast and their adoption tried
 grapple them to thy soul with hoops of steel
 but do not dull thy palm with entertainment
 of each newhatch'd unfledged comrade beware
 of entrance to a quarrel but being in
 bear't that the opposed may beware of thee
 give every man thy ear but few thy voice
 take each man's censure but reserve thy judgment
 costly thy habit as thy purse can buy
 but not express'd in fancy rich not gaudy
 for the apparel oft proclaims the man
 and they in france of the best rank and station
 are of a most select and generous chief in that
 neither a borrower nor a lender be
 for loan oft loses both itself and friend
 and borrowing dulls the edge of husbandry
 this above all to thine ownself be true
 and it must follow as the night the day
 thou canst not then be false to any man
 farewell my blessing season this in thee
laertes most humbly do i take my leave my lord
lord polonius the time invites you go your servants tend
laertes farewell ophelia and remember well
 what i have said to you
ophelia tis in my memory lock'd
 and you yourself shall keep the key of it
laertes farewell
 exit
lord polonius what is't ophelia be hath said to you
ophelia so please you something touching the lord hamlet
lord polonius marry well bethought
 tis told me he hath very oft of late
 given private time to you and you yourself
 have of your audience been most free and bounteous
 if it be so as so tis put on me
 and that in way of caution i must tell you
 you do not understand yourself so clearly
 as it behoves my daughter and your honour
 what is between you give me up the truth
ophelia he hath my lord of late made many tenders
 of his affection to me
lord polonius affection pooh you speak like a green girl
 unsifted in such perilous circumstance
 do you believe his tenders as you call them
ophelia i do not know my lord what i should think
lord polonius marry i'll teach you think yourself a baby
 that you have ta'en these tenders for true pay
 which are not sterling tender yourself more dearly
 ornot to crack the wind of the poor phrase
 running it thusyou'll tender me a fool
ophelia my lord he hath importuned me with love
 in honourable fashion
lord polonius ay fashion you may call it go to go to
ophelia and hath given countenance to his speech my lord
 with almost all the holy vows of heaven
lord polonius ay springes to catch woodcocks i do know
 when the blood burns how prodigal the soul
 lends the tongue vows these blazes daughter
 giving more light than heat extinct in both
 even in their promise as it is amaking
 you must not take for fire from this time
 be somewhat scanter of your maiden presence
 set your entreatments at a higher rate
 than a command to parley for lord hamlet
 believe so much in him that he is young
 and with a larger tether may he walk
 than may be given you in few ophelia
