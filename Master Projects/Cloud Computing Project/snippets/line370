 that he does weigh too light my greatest grief
 though little he do feel it set down sharply
 dispatch the most convenient messenger
 when haply he shall hear that she is gone
 he will return and hope i may that she
 hearing so much will speed her foot again
 led hither by pure love which of them both
 is dearest to me i have no skill in sense
 to make distinction provide this messenger
 my heart is heavy and mine age is weak
 grief would have tears and sorrow bids me speak
 exeunt
 all's well that ends well

 a shrewd turn if she pleased

act iii
scene vi camp before florence
 enter bertram and the two french lords
second lord nay good my lord put him to't let him have his
 way
first lord if your lordship find him not a hilding hold me no
 more in your respect
second lord on my life my lord a bubble
bertram do you think i am so far deceived in him
second lord believe it my lord in mine own direct knowledge
 without any malice but to speak of him as my
 kinsman he's a most notable coward an infinite and
 endless liar an hourly promisebreaker the owner
 of no one good quality worthy your lordship's
 entertainment
first lord it were fit you knew him lest reposing too far in
 his virtue which he hath not he might at some
 great and trusty business in a main danger fail you
bertram i would i knew in what particular action to try him
first lord none better than to let him fetch off his drum
 which you hear him so confidently undertake to do
second lord i with a troop of florentines will suddenly
 surprise him such i will have whom i am sure he
 knows not from the enemy we will bind and hoodwink
 him so that he shall suppose no other but that he
 is carried into the leaguer of the adversaries when
 we bring him to our own tents be but your lordship
 present at his examination if he do not for the
 promise of his life and in the highest compulsion of
 base fear offer to betray you and deliver all the
 intelligence in his power against you and that with
 the divine forfeit of his soul upon oath never
 trust my judgment in any thing
first lord o for the love of laughter let him fetch his drum
 he says he has a stratagem for't when your
 lordship sees the bottom of his success in't and to
 what metal this counterfeit lump of ore will be
 melted if you give him not john drum's
 entertainment your inclining cannot be removed
 here he comes
 enter parolles
second lord aside to bertram o for the love of laughter
 hinder not the honour of his design let him fetch
 off his drum in any hand
bertram how now monsieur this drum sticks sorely in your
 disposition
first lord a pox on't let it go tis but a drum
parolles but a drum is't but a drum a drum so lost
 there was excellent commandto charge in with our
 horse upon our own wings and to rend our own soldiers
first lord that was not to be blamed in the command of the
 service it was a disaster of war that caesar
 himself could not have prevented if he had been
 there to command
bertram well we cannot greatly condemn our success some
 dishonour we had in the loss of that drum but it is
 not to be recovered
parolles it might have been recovered
bertram it might but it is not now
parolles it is to be recovered but that the merit of
 service is seldom attributed to the true and exact
