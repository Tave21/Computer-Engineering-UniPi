thurio that hath more mind to feed on your blood than live
 in your air
valentine you have said sir
thurio ay sir and done too for this time
valentine i know it well sir you always end ere you begin
silvia a fine volley of words gentlemen and quickly shot off
valentine tis indeed madam we thank the giver
silvia who is that servant
valentine yourself sweet lady for you gave the fire sir
 thurio borrows his wit from your ladyship's looks
 and spends what he borrows kindly in your company
thurio sir if you spend word for word with me i shall
 make your wit bankrupt
valentine i know it well sir you have an exchequer of words
 and i think no other treasure to give your
 followers for it appears by their bare liveries
 that they live by your bare words
silvia no more gentlemen no morehere comes my father

duke now daughter silvia you are hard beset
 sir valentine your father's in good health
 what say you to a letter from your friends
 of much good news
valentine my lord i will be thankful
 to any happy messenger from thence
duke know ye don antonio your countryman
valentine ay my good lord i know the gentleman
 to be of worth and worthy estimation
 and not without desert so well reputed
duke hath he not a son
valentine ay my good lord a son that well deserves
 the honour and regard of such a father
duke you know him well
valentine i know him as myself for from our infancy
 we have conversed and spent our hours together
 and though myself have been an idle truant
 omitting the sweet benefit of time
 to clothe mine age with angellike perfection
 yet hath sir proteus for that's his name
 made use and fair advantage of his days
 his years but young but his experience old
 his head unmellow'd but his judgment ripe
 and in a word for far behind his worth
 comes all the praises that i now bestow
 he is complete in feature and in mind
 with all good grace to grace a gentleman
duke beshrew me sir but if he make this good
 he is as worthy for an empress love
 as meet to be an emperor's counsellor
 well sir this gentleman is come to me
 with commendation from great potentates
 and here he means to spend his time awhile
 i think tis no unwelcome news to you
valentine should i have wish'd a thing it had been he
duke welcome him then according to his worth
 silvia i speak to you and you sir thurio
 for valentine i need not cite him to it
 i will send him hither to you presently
 exit
valentine this is the gentleman i told your ladyship
 had come along with me but that his mistress
 did hold his eyes lock'd in her crystal looks
silvia belike that now she hath enfranchised them
 upon some other pawn for fealty
valentine nay sure i think she holds them prisoners still
silvia nay then he should be blind and being blind
 how could he see his way to seek out you
valentine why lady love hath twenty pair of eyes
thurio they say that love hath not an eye at all
valentine to see such lovers thurio as yourself
 upon a homely object love can wink
silvia have done have done here comes the gentleman
 exit thurio
 enter proteus
valentine welcome dear proteus mistress i beseech you
 confirm his welcome with some special favour
silvia his worth is warrant for his welcome hither
 if this be he you oft have wish'd to hear from
valentine mistress it is sweet lady entertain him
 to be my fellowservant to your ladyship
silvia too low a mistress for so high a servant
proteus not so sweet lady but too mean a servant
 to have a look of such a worthy mistress
valentine leave off discourse of disability
 sweet lady entertain him for your servant
proteus my duty will i boast of nothing else
silvia and duty never yet did want his meed
 servant you are welcome to a worthless mistress
proteus i'll die on him that says so but yourself
silvia that you are welcome
proteus that you are worthless
 reenter thurio
thurio madam my lord your father would speak with you
silvia i wait upon his pleasure come sir thurio
 go with me once more new servant welcome
 i'll leave you to confer of home affairs
 when you have done we look to hear from you
proteus we'll both attend upon your ladyship
 exeunt silvia and thurio
valentine now tell me how do all from whence you came
proteus your friends are well and have them much commended
valentine and how do yours
proteus i left them all in health
valentine how does your lady and how thrives your love
proteus my tales of love were wont to weary you
 i know you joy not in a love discourse
valentine ay proteus but that life is alter'd now
 i have done penance for contemning love
 whose high imperious thoughts have punish'd me
 with bitter fasts with penitential groans
 with nightly tears and daily heartsore sighs
 for in revenge of my contempt of love
 love hath chased sleep from my enthralled eyes
 and made them watchers of mine own heart's sorrow
 o gentle proteus love's a mighty lord
 and hath so humbled me as i confess
 there is no woe to his correction
 nor to his service no such joy on earth
 now no discourse except it be of love
 now can i break my fast dine sup and sleep
 upon the very naked name of love
proteus enough i read your fortune in your eye
 was this the idol that you worship so
valentine even she and is she not a heavenly saint
proteus no but she is an earthly paragon
valentine call her divine
proteus i will not flatter her
valentine o flatter me for love delights in praises
proteus when i was sick you gave me bitter pills
 and i must minister the like to you
valentine then speak the truth by her if not divine
 yet let her be a principality
 sovereign to all the creatures on the earth
proteus except my mistress
valentine sweet except not any
 except thou wilt except against my love
proteus have i not reason to prefer mine own
valentine and i will help thee to prefer her too
 she shall be dignified with this high honour
 to bear my lady's train lest the base earth
 should from her vesture chance to steal a kiss
 and of so great a favour growing proud
