 his action of battery hum this fellow might be
 in's time a great buyer of land with his statutes

 the recovery of his recoveries to have his fine
 pate full of fine dirt will his vouchers vouch him

 it the age is grown so picked that the toe of the
 peasant comes so near the heel of the courtier he
 gaffs his kibe how long hast thou been a
 gravemaker
first clown of all the days i the year i came to't that day
 that our last king hamlet overcame fortinbras
hamlet how long is that since
first clown cannot you tell that every fool can tell that it
 was the very day that young hamlet was born he that

first clown why because he was mad he shall recover his wits
 there or if he do not it's no great matter there

 hold the laying inhe will last you some eight year
 or nine year a tanner will last you nine year
hamlet why he more than another
first clown why sir his hide is so tanned with his trade that
 he will keep out water a great while and your water
 is a sore decayer of your whoreson dead body
 here's a skull now this skull has lain in the earth
 three and twenty years
hamlet whose was it
first clown a whoreson mad fellow's it was whose do you think it was
hamlet nay i know not
first clown a pestilence on him for a mad rogue a poured a
 flagon of rhenish on my head once this same skull
 sir was yorick's skull the king's jester
hamlet this
first clown e'en that
hamlet let me see
 takes the skull
 alas poor yorick i knew him horatio a fellow
 of infinite jest of most excellent fancy he hath
 borne me on his back a thousand times and now how
 abhorred in my imagination it is my gorge rims at
 it here hung those lips that i have kissed i know
 not how oft where be your gibes now your
 gambols your songs your flashes of merriment
 that were wont to set the table on a roar not one
 now to mock your own grinning quite chapfallen
 now get you to my lady's chamber and tell her let
 her paint an inch thick to this favour she must
 come make her laugh at that prithee horatio tell
 me one thing
horatio what's that my lord
hamlet dost thou think alexander looked o this fashion i'
 the earth
horatio e'en so
hamlet and smelt so pah
 puts down the skull
horatio e'en so my lord
hamlet to what base uses we may return horatio why may
 not imagination trace the noble dust of alexander
 till he find it stopping a bunghole
horatio twere to consider too curiously to consider so
hamlet no faith not a jot but to follow him thither with
 modesty enough and likelihood to lead it as
 thus alexander died alexander was buried
 alexander returneth into dust the dust is earth of
 earth we make loam and why of that loam whereto he
 was converted might they not stop a beerbarrel
 imperious caesar dead and turn'd to clay
 might stop a hole to keep the wind away
 o that that earth which kept the world in awe
 should patch a wall to expel the winter flaw
 but soft but soft aside here comes the king
 enter priest &c in procession the corpse of
 ophelia laertes and mourners following king
 claudius queen gertrude their trains &c
 the queen the courtiers who is this they follow
 and with such maimed rites this doth betoken
 the corse they follow did with desperate hand
 fordo its own life twas of some estate
 couch we awhile and mark
 retiring with horatio
laertes what ceremony else
hamlet that is laertes
 a very noble youth mark
laertes what ceremony else
first priest her obsequies have been as far enlarged
 as we have warrantise her death was doubtful
 and but that great command o'ersways the order
 she should in ground unsanctified have lodged
 till the last trumpet for charitable prayers
 shards flints and pebbles should be thrown on her
 yet here she is allow'd her virgin crants
 her maiden strewments and the bringing home
 of bell and burial
laertes must there no more be done
first priest no more be done
 we should profane the service of the dead
 to sing a requiem and such rest to her
 as to peaceparted souls
laertes lay her i the earth
 and from her fair and unpolluted flesh
 may violets spring i tell thee churlish priest
 a ministering angel shall my sister be
 when thou liest howling
hamlet what the fair ophelia
queen gertrude sweets to the sweet farewell
 scattering flowers
 i hoped thou shouldst have been my hamlet's wife
 i thought thy bridebed to have deck'd sweet maid
 and not have strew'd thy grave
laertes o treble woe
 fall ten times treble on that cursed head
 whose wicked deed thy most ingenious sense
 deprived thee of hold off the earth awhile
 till i have caught her once more in mine arms
 leaps into the grave
 now pile your dust upon the quick and dead
 till of this flat a mountain you have made
 to o'ertop old pelion or the skyish head
 of blue olympus
hamlet advancing what is he whose grief
 bears such an emphasis whose phrase of sorrow
 conjures the wandering stars and makes them stand
 like wonderwounded hearers this is i
 hamlet the dane
 leaps into the grave
laertes the devil take thy soul
 grappling with him
hamlet thou pray'st not well
 i prithee take thy fingers from my throat
 for though i am not splenitive and rash
 yet have i something in me dangerous
