servant master there is three carters three shepherds
 three neatherds three swineherds that have made
 themselves all men of hair they call themselves
 saltiers and they have a dance which the wenches
 say is a gallimaufry of gambols because they are
 not in't but they themselves are o the mind if it
 be not too rough for some that know little but
 bowling it will please plentifully
shepherd away we'll none on t here has been too much
 homely foolery already i know sir we weary you
polixenes you weary those that refresh us pray let's see
 these four threes of herdsmen
servant one three of them by their own report sir hath
 danced before the king and not the worst of the
 three but jumps twelve foot and a half by the squier
shepherd leave your prating since these good men are
 pleased let them come in but quickly now
servant why they stay at door sir
 exit
 here a dance of twelve satyrs
polixenes o father you'll know more of that hereafter
 to camillo
 is it not too far gone tis time to part them
 he's simple and tells much
 to florizel
 how now fair shepherd
 your heart is full of something that does take
 your mind from feasting sooth when i was young
 and handed love as you do i was wont
 to load my she with knacks i would have ransack'd
 the pedlar's silken treasury and have pour'd it
 to her acceptance you have let him go
 and nothing marted with him if your lass
 interpretation should abuse and call this
 your lack of love or bounty you were straited
 for a reply at least if you make a care
 of happy holding her
florizel old sir i know
 she prizes not such trifles as these are
 the gifts she looks from me are pack'd and lock'd
 up in my heart which i have given already
 but not deliver'd o hear me breathe my life
 before this ancient sir who it should seem
 hath sometime loved i take thy hand this hand
 as soft as dove's down and as white as it
 or ethiopian's tooth or the fann'd
 snow that's bolted
 by the northern blasts twice o'er
polixenes what follows this
 how prettily the young swain seems to wash
 the hand was fair before i have put you out
 but to your protestation let me hear
 what you profess
florizel do and be witness to t
polixenes and this my neighbour too
florizel and he and more
 than he and men the earth the heavens and all
 that were i crown'd the most imperial monarch
 thereof most worthy were i the fairest youth
 that ever made eye swerve had force and knowledge
 more than was ever man's i would not prize them
 without her love for her employ them all
 commend them and condemn them to her service
 or to their own perdition
polixenes fairly offer'd
camillo this shows a sound affection
shepherd but my daughter
 say you the like to him
perdita i cannot speak
 so well nothing so well no nor mean better
 by the pattern of mine own thoughts i cut out
 the purity of his
shepherd take hands a bargain
 and friends unknown you shall bear witness to t
 i give my daughter to him and will make
 her portion equal his
florizel o that must be
 i the virtue of your daughter one being dead
 i shall have more than you can dream of yet
 enough then for your wonder but come on
 contract us fore these witnesses
shepherd come your hand
 and daughter yours
polixenes soft swain awhile beseech you
 have you a father
florizel i have but what of him
polixenes knows he of this
florizel he neither does nor shall
polixenes methinks a father
 is at the nuptial of his son a guest
 that best becomes the table pray you once more
 is not your father grown incapable
 of reasonable affairs is he not stupid
 with age and altering rheums can he speak hear
 know man from man dispute his own estate
 lies he not bedrid and again does nothing
 but what he did being childish
florizel no good sir
 he has his health and ampler strength indeed
 than most have of his age
polixenes by my white beard
 you offer him if this be so a wrong
 something unfilial reason my son
 should choose himself a wife but as good reason
 the father all whose joy is nothing else
 but fair posterity should hold some counsel
 in such a business
florizel i yield all this
 but for some other reasons my grave sir
 which tis not fit you know i not acquaint
 my father of this business
polixenes let him know't
florizel he shall not
polixenes prithee let him
florizel no he must not
shepherd let him my son he shall not need to grieve
 at knowing of thy choice
florizel come come he must not
 mark our contract
polixenes mark your divorce young sir
 discovering himself
 whom son i dare not call thou art too base
 to be acknowledged thou a sceptre's heir
 that thus affect'st a sheephook thou old traitor
 i am sorry that by hanging thee i can
 but shorten thy life one week and thou fresh piece
 of excellent witchcraft who of force must know
 the royal fool thou copest with
shepherd o my heart
polixenes i'll have thy beauty scratch'd with briers and made
 more homely than thy state for thee fond boy
 if i may ever know thou dost but sigh
 that thou no more shalt see this knack as never
 i mean thou shalt we'll bar thee from succession
 not hold thee of our blood no not our kin
 far than deucalion off mark thou my words
 follow us to the court thou churl for this time
 though full of our displeasure yet we free thee
 from the dead blow of it and you enchantment
 worthy enough a herdsman yea him too
 that makes himself but for our honour therein
 unworthy theeif ever henceforth thou
 these rural latches to his entrance open
 or hoop his body more with thy embraces
 i will devise a death as cruel for thee
 as thou art tender to't
 exit
perdita even here undone
 i was not much afeard for once or twice
 i was about to speak and tell him plainly
 the selfsame sun that shines upon his court
 hides not his visage from our cottage but
 looks on alike will't please you sir be gone
