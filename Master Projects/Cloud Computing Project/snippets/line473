falstaff speak good master brook i shall be glad to be
 your servant
ford sir i hear you are a scholari will be brief
 with youand you have been a man long known to me
 though i had never so good means as desire to make
 myself acquainted with you i shall discover a
 thing to you wherein i must very much lay open mine
 own imperfection but good sir john as you have
 one eye upon my follies as you hear them unfolded
 turn another into the register of your own that i
 may pass with a reproof the easier sith you
 yourself know how easy it is to be such an offender
falstaff very well sir proceed
ford there is a gentlewoman in this town her husband's
 name is ford
falstaff well sir
ford i have long loved her and i protest to you
 bestowed much on her followed her with a doting
 observance engrossed opportunities to meet her
 fee'd every slight occasion that could but niggardly
 give me sight of her not only bought many presents
 to give her but have given largely to many to know
 what she would have given briefly i have pursued
 her as love hath pursued me which hath been on the
 wing of all occasions but whatsoever i have
 merited either in my mind or in my means meed
 i am sure i have received none unless experience
 be a jewel that i have purchased at an infinite
 rate and that hath taught me to say this
 love like a shadow flies when substance love pursues
 pursuing that that flies and flying what pursues'
falstaff have you received no promise of satisfaction at her hands
ford never
falstaff have you importuned her to such a purpose
ford never
falstaff of what quality was your love then
ford like a fair house built on another man's ground so
 that i have lost my edifice by mistaking the place
 where i erected it
falstaff to what purpose have you unfolded this to me
ford when i have told you that i have told you all
 some say that though she appear honest to me yet in
 other places she enlargeth her mirth so far that
 there is shrewd construction made of her now sir
 john here is the heart of my purpose you are a
 gentleman of excellent breeding admirable
 discourse of great admittance authentic in your
 place and person generally allowed for your many
 warlike courtlike and learned preparations
falstaff o sir
ford believe it for you know it there is money spend
 it spend it spend more spend all i have only
 give me so much of your time in exchange of it as
 to lay an amiable siege to the honesty of this
 ford's wife use your art of wooing win her to
 consent to you if any man may you may as soon as
 any
falstaff would it apply well to the vehemency of your
 affection that i should win what you would enjoy
 methinks you prescribe to yourself very preposterously
ford o understand my drift she dwells so securely on
 the excellency of her honour that the folly of my
 soul dares not present itself she is too bright to
 be looked against now could i could come to her
 with any detection in my hand my desires had
 instance and argument to commend themselves i
 could drive her then from the ward of her purity
 her reputation her marriagevow and a thousand
 other her defences which now are too too strongly
 embattled against me what say you to't sir john
falstaff master brook i will first make bold with your
 money next give me your hand and last as i am a
 gentleman you shall if you will enjoy ford's wife
