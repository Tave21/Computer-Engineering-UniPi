hamlet what ho horatio
 enter horatio
horatio here sweet lord at your service
hamlet horatio thou art e'en as just a man
 as e'er my conversation coped withal
horatio o my dear lord
hamlet nay do not think i flatter
 for what advancement may i hope from thee
 that no revenue hast but thy good spirits
 to feed and clothe thee why should the poor be flatter'd
 no let the candied tongue lick absurd pomp
 and crook the pregnant hinges of the knee
 where thrift may follow fawning dost thou hear
 since my dear soul was mistress of her choice
 and could of men distinguish her election
 hath seal'd thee for herself for thou hast been
 as one in suffering all that suffers nothing
 a man that fortune's buffets and rewards
 hast ta'en with equal thanks and blest are those
 whose blood and judgment are so well commingled
 that they are not a pipe for fortune's finger
 to sound what stop she please give me that man
 that is not passion's slave and i will wear him
 in my heart's core ay in my heart of heart
 as i do theesomething too much of this
 there is a play tonight before the king
 one scene of it comes near the circumstance
 which i have told thee of my father's death
 i prithee when thou seest that act afoot
 even with the very comment of thy soul
 observe mine uncle if his occulted guilt
 do not itself unkennel in one speech
 it is a damned ghost that we have seen
 and my imaginations are as foul
 as vulcan's stithy give him heedful note
 for i mine eyes will rivet to his face
 and after we will both our judgments join
 in censure of his seeming
horatio well my lord
 if he steal aught the whilst this play is playing
 and scape detecting i will pay the theft
hamlet they are coming to the play i must be idle

prologue for us and for our tragedy
 here stooping to your clemency
 we beg your hearing patiently
 exit
hamlet is this a prologue or the posy of a ring
ophelia tis brief my lord
hamlet as woman's love
 enter two players king and queen
player king full thirty times hath phoebus cart gone round
 neptune's salt wash and tellus orbed ground
 and thirty dozen moons with borrow'd sheen
 about the world have times twelve thirties been
 since love our hearts and hymen did our hands
 unite commutual in most sacred bands
player queen so many journeys may the sun and moon
 make us again count o'er ere love be done
 but woe is me you are so sick of late
 so far from cheer and from your former state
 that i distrust you yet though i distrust
 discomfort you my lord it nothing must
 for women's fear and love holds quantity
 in neither aught or in extremity
 now what my love is proof hath made you know
 and as my love is sized my fear is so
 where love is great the littlest doubts are fear
 where little fears grow great great love grows there
player king faith i must leave thee love and shortly too
 my operant powers their functions leave to do
 and thou shalt live in this fair world behind
 honour'd beloved and haply one as kind
 for husband shalt thou
player queen o confound the rest
 such love must needs be treason in my breast
 in second husband let me be accurst
 none wed the second but who kill'd the first
hamlet aside wormwood wormwood
player queen the instances that second marriage move
 are base respects of thrift but none of love
 a second time i kill my husband dead
 when second husband kisses me in bed
player king i do believe you think what now you speak
 but what we do determine oft we break
 purpose is but the slave to memory
 of violent birth but poor validity
 which now like fruit unripe sticks on the tree
 but fall unshaken when they mellow be
 most necessary tis that we forget
 to pay ourselves what to ourselves is debt
 what to ourselves in passion we propose
 the passion ending doth the purpose lose
 the violence of either grief or joy
 their own enactures with themselves destroy
 where joy most revels grief doth most lament
 grief joys joy grieves on slender accident
 this world is not for aye nor tis not strange
 that even our loves should with our fortunes change
 for tis a question left us yet to prove
 whether love lead fortune or else fortune love
 the great man down you mark his favourite flies
 the poor advanced makes friends of enemies
 and hitherto doth love on fortune tend
 for who not needs shall never lack a friend
 and who in want a hollow friend doth try
 directly seasons him his enemy
 but orderly to end where i begun
 our wills and fates do so contrary run
 that our devices still are overthrown
 our thoughts are ours their ends none of our own
 so think thou wilt no second husband wed
 but die thy thoughts when thy first lord is dead
player queen nor earth to me give food nor heaven light
 sport and repose lock from me day and night
 to desperation turn my trust and hope
 an anchor's cheer in prison be my scope
 each opposite that blanks the face of joy
 meet what i would have well and it destroy
 both here and hence pursue me lasting strife
 if once a widow ever i be wife
hamlet if she should break it now
player king tis deeply sworn sweet leave me here awhile
