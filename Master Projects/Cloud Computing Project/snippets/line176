scene rome and the neighbourhood corioli
 and the neighbourhood antium
 coriolanus
act i
scene i rome a street
 enter a company of mutinous citizens with staves
 clubs and other weapons
first citizen before we proceed any further hear me speak
all speak speak
first citizen you are all resolved rather to die than to famish
all resolved resolved
first citizen first you know caius marcius is chief enemy to the people
all we know't we know't
first citizen let us kill him and we'll have corn at our own price
 is't a verdict
all no more talking on't let it be done away away
second citizen one word good citizens
first citizen we are accounted poor citizens the patricians good
 what authority surfeits on would relieve us if they
 would yield us but the superfluity while it were
 wholesome we might guess they relieved us humanely
 but they think we are too dear the leanness that
 afflicts us the object of our misery is as an
 inventory to particularise their abundance our
 sufferance is a gain to them let us revenge this with
 our pikes ere we become rakes for the gods know i
 speak this in hunger for bread not in thirst for revenge
second citizen would you proceed especially against caius marcius
all against him first he's a very dog to the commonalty
second citizen consider you what services he has done for his country
first citizen very well and could be content to give him good
 report fort but that he pays himself with being proud
second citizen nay but speak not maliciously
first citizen i say unto you what he hath done famously he did
 it to that end though softconscienced men can be
 content to say it was for his country he did it to
 please his mother and to be partly proud which he
 is even till the altitude of his virtue
second citizen what he cannot help in his nature you account a
 vice in him you must in no way say he is covetous
first citizen if i must not i need not be barren of accusations
 he hath faults with surplus to tire in repetition
 shouts within
 what shouts are these the other side o the city
 is risen why stay we prating here to the capitol
all come come
first citizen soft who comes here
 enter menenius agrippa
second citizen worthy menenius agrippa one that hath always loved
 the people
first citizen he's one honest enough would all the rest were so
menenius what work's my countrymen in hand where go you
 with bats and clubs the matter speak i pray you
first citizen our business is not unknown to the senate they have
 had inkling this fortnight what we intend to do
 which now we'll show em in deeds they say poor
 suitors have strong breaths they shall know we
 have strong arms too
menenius why masters my good friends mine honest neighbours
 will you undo yourselves
first citizen we cannot sir we are undone already
menenius i tell you friends most charitable care
 have the patricians of you for your wants
 your suffering in this dearth you may as well
 strike at the heaven with your staves as lift them
 against the roman state whose course will on
 the way it takes cracking ten thousand curbs
 of more strong link asunder than can ever
 appear in your impediment for the dearth
 the gods not the patricians make it and
 your knees to them not arms must help alack
 you are transported by calamity
 thither where more attends you and you slander
 the helms o the state who care for you like fathers
 when you curse them as enemies
first citizen care for us true indeed they ne'er cared for us
 yet suffer us to famish and their storehouses
 crammed with grain make edicts for usury to
 support usurers repeal daily any wholesome act
 established against the rich and provide more
 piercing statutes daily to chain up and restrain
 the poor if the wars eat us not up they will and
 there's all the love they bear us
menenius either you must
 confess yourselves wondrous malicious
 or be accused of folly i shall tell you
 a pretty tale it may be you have heard it
 but since it serves my purpose i will venture
 to stale t a little more
first citizen well i'll hear it sir yet you must not think to
 fob off our disgrace with a tale but an t please
 you deliver
menenius there was a time when all the body's members
 rebell'd against the belly thus accused it
 that only like a gulf it did remain
 i the midst o the body idle and unactive
 still cupboarding the viand never bearing
 like labour with the rest where the other instruments
 did see and hear devise instruct walk feel
 and mutually participate did minister
 unto the appetite and affection common
 of the whole body the belly answer'd
first citizen well sir what answer made the belly
menenius sir i shall tell you with a kind of smile
 which ne'er came from the lungs but even thus
 for look you i may make the belly smile
 as well as speakit tauntingly replied
 to the discontented members the mutinous parts
 that envied his receipt even so most fitly
 as you malign our senators for that
 they are not such as you
first citizen your belly's answer what
 the kinglycrowned head the vigilant eye
 the counsellor heart the arm our soldier
 our steed the leg the tongue our trumpeter
 with other muniments and petty helps
 in this our fabric if that they
menenius what then
 fore me this fellow speaks what then what then
first citizen should by the cormorant belly be restrain'd
 who is the sink o the body
menenius well what then
first citizen the former agents if they did complain
 what could the belly answer
menenius i will tell you
 if you'll bestow a smallof what you have little
 patience awhile you'll hear the belly's answer
first citizen ye're long about it
menenius note me this good friend
 your most grave belly was deliberate
 not rash like his accusers and thus answer'd
 true is it my incorporate friends quoth he
 that i receive the general food at first
 which you do live upon and fit it is
 because i am the storehouse and the shop
 of the whole body but if you do remember
 i send it through the rivers of your blood
 even to the court the heart to the seat o the brain
 and through the cranks and offices of man
 the strongest nerves and small inferior veins
 from me receive that natural competency
 whereby they live and though that all at once
 you my good friends'this says the belly mark me
first citizen ay sir well well
menenius though all at once cannot
 see what i do deliver out to each
 yet i can make my audit up that all
 from me do back receive the flour of all
 and leave me but the bran what say you to't
first citizen it was an answer how apply you this
menenius the senators of rome are this good belly
 and you the mutinous members for examine
 their counsels and their cares digest things rightly
 touching the weal o the common you shall find
 no public benefit which you receive
 but it proceeds or comes from them to you
 and no way from yourselves what do you think
 you the great toe of this assembly
first citizen i the great toe why the great toe
menenius for that being one o the lowest basest poorest
 of this most wise rebellion thou go'st foremost
 thou rascal that art worst in blood to run
 lead'st first to win some vantage
 but make you ready your stiff bats and clubs
 rome and her rats are at the point of battle
 the one side must have bale
 enter caius marcius
 hail noble marcius
marcius thanks what's the matter you dissentious rogues
 that rubbing the poor itch of your opinion
 make yourselves scabs
first citizen we have ever your good word
marcius he that will give good words to thee will flatter
 beneath abhorring what would you have you curs
 that like nor peace nor war the one affrights you
 the other makes you proud he that trusts to you
 where he should find you lions finds you hares
 where foxes geese you are no surer no
