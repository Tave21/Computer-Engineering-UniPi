 monsieur love i will hide me in the arbour
 withdraws
 enter don pedro claudio and leonato
don pedro come shall we hear this music
claudio yea my good lord how still the evening is
 as hush'd on purpose to grace harmony
don pedro see you where benedick hath hid himself
claudio o very well my lord the music ended
 we'll fit the kidfox with a pennyworth
 enter balthasar with music
don pedro come balthasar we'll hear that song again
balthasar o good my lord tax not so bad a voice
 to slander music any more than once
don pedro it is the witness still of excellency
 to put a strange face on his own perfection
 i pray thee sing and let me woo no more
balthasar because you talk of wooing i will sing
 since many a wooer doth commence his suit
 to her he thinks not worthy yet he wooes
 yet will he swear he loves
don pedro now pray thee come
 or if thou wilt hold longer argument
 do it in notes
balthasar note this before my notes
 there's not a note of mine that's worth the noting
don pedro why these are very crotchets that he speaks
 note notes forsooth and nothing
 air
benedick now divine air now is his soul ravished is it
 not strange that sheeps guts should hale souls out
 of men's bodies well a horn for my money when
 all's done
 the song
balthasar sigh no more ladies sigh no more
 men were deceivers ever
 one foot in sea and one on shore
 to one thing constant never
 then sigh not so but let them go
 and be you blithe and bonny
 converting all your sounds of woe
 into hey nonny nonny
 sing no more ditties sing no moe
 of dumps so dull and heavy
 the fraud of men was ever so
 since summer first was leafy
 then sigh not so &c
don pedro by my troth a good song
balthasar and an ill singer my lord
don pedro ha no no faith thou singest well enough for a shift
benedick an he had been a dog that should have howled thus
 they would have hanged him and i pray god his bad
 voice bode no mischief i had as lief have heard the
 nightraven come what plague could have come after
 it
don pedro yea marry dost thou hear balthasar i pray thee
 get us some excellent music for tomorrow night we
 would have it at the lady hero's chamberwindow
balthasar the best i can my lord
don pedro do so farewell
 exit balthasar
 come hither leonato what was it you told me of
 today that your niece beatrice was in love with
 signior benedick
claudio o ay stalk on stalk on the fowl sits i did
 never think that lady would have loved any man
leonato no nor i neither but most wonderful that she
 should so dote on signior benedick whom she hath in
 all outward behaviors seemed ever to abhor
benedick is't possible sits the wind in that corner
leonato by my troth my lord i cannot tell what to think
 of it but that she loves him with an enraged
 affection it is past the infinite of thought
don pedro may be she doth but counterfeit
claudio faith like enough
leonato o god counterfeit there was never counterfeit of
 passion came so near the life of passion as she
 discovers it
don pedro why what effects of passion shows she
claudio bait the hook well this fish will bite
leonato what effects my lord she will sit you you heard
 my daughter tell you how
claudio she did indeed
don pedro how how pray you you amaze me i would have i
 thought her spirit had been invincible against all
 assaults of affection
leonato i would have sworn it had my lord especially
 against benedick
benedick i should think this a gull but that the
 whitebearded fellow speaks it knavery cannot
 sure hide himself in such reverence
claudio he hath ta'en the infection hold it up
don pedro hath she made her affection known to benedick
leonato no and swears she never will that's her torment
claudio tis true indeed so your daughter says shall
 i says she that have so oft encountered him
 with scorn write to him that i love him'
leonato this says she now when she is beginning to write to
 him for she'll be up twenty times a night and
 there will she sit in her smock till she have writ a
 sheet of paper my daughter tells us all
claudio now you talk of a sheet of paper i remember a
 pretty jest your daughter told us of
leonato o when she had writ it and was reading it over she
 found benedick and beatrice between the sheet
claudio that
leonato o she tore the letter into a thousand halfpence
 railed at herself that she should be so immodest
 to write to one that she knew would flout her i
 measure him says she by my own spirit for i
 should flout him if he writ to me yea though i
 love him i should'
claudio then down upon her knees she falls weeps sobs
 beats her heart tears her hair prays curses o
 sweet benedick god give me patience'
leonato she doth indeed my daughter says so and the
 ecstasy hath so much overborne her that my daughter
 is sometime afeared she will do a desperate outrage
 to herself it is very true
don pedro it were good that benedick knew of it by some
 other if she will not discover it
claudio to what end he would make but a sport of it and
 torment the poor lady worse
don pedro an he should it were an alms to hang him she's an
 excellent sweet lady and out of all suspicion
 she is virtuous
claudio and she is exceeding wise
don pedro in every thing but in loving benedick
leonato o my lord wisdom and blood combating in so tender
 a body we have ten proofs to one that blood hath
 the victory i am sorry for her as i have just
 cause being her uncle and her guardian
don pedro i would she had bestowed this dotage on me i would
 have daffed all other respects and made her half
 myself i pray you tell benedick of it and hear
 what a will say
leonato were it good think you
claudio hero thinks surely she will die for she says she
 will die if he love her not and she will die ere
 she make her love known and she will die if he woo
 her rather than she will bate one breath of her
 accustomed crossness
don pedro she doth well if she should make tender of her
 love tis very possible he'll scorn it for the
 man as you know all hath a contemptible spirit
claudio he is a very proper man
don pedro he hath indeed a good outward happiness
claudio before god and in my mind very wise
don pedro he doth indeed show some sparks that are like wit
claudio and i take him to be valiant
don pedro as hector i assure you and in the managing of
 quarrels you may say he is wise for either he
 avoids them with great discretion or undertakes
 them with a most christianlike fear
leonato if he do fear god a must necessarily keep peace
 if he break the peace he ought to enter into a
 quarrel with fear and trembling
don pedro and so will he do for the man doth fear god
 howsoever it seems not in him by some large jests
 he will make well i am sorry for your niece shall
 we go seek benedick and tell him of her love
claudio never tell him my lord let her wear it out with
 good counsel
leonato nay that's impossible she may wear her heart out first
don pedro well we will hear further of it by your daughter
 let it cool the while i love benedick well and i
 could wish he would modestly examine himself to see
 how much he is unworthy so good a lady
leonato my lord will you walk dinner is ready
claudio if he do not dote on her upon this i will never
 trust my expectation
don pedro let there be the same net spread for her and that
 must your daughter and her gentlewomen carry the
 sport will be when they hold one an opinion of
 another's dotage and no such matter that's the
 scene that i would see which will be merely a
 dumbshow let us send her to call him in to dinner
 exeunt don pedro claudio and leonato
benedick coming forward this can be no trick the
 conference was sadly borne they have the truth of
 this from hero they seem to pity the lady it
 seems her affections have their full bent love me
 why it must be requited i hear how i am censured
 they say i will bear myself proudly if i perceive
 the love come from her they say too that she will
 rather die than give any sign of affection i did
 never think to marry i must not seem proud happy
 are they that hear their detractions and can put
 them to mending they say the lady is fair tis a
 truth i can bear them witness and virtuous tis
 so i cannot reprove it and wise but for loving
 me by my troth it is no addition to her wit nor
 no great argument of her folly for i will be
 horribly in love with her i may chance have some
 odd quirks and remnants of wit broken on me
 because i have railed so long against marriage but
 doth not the appetite alter a man loves the meat
 in his youth that he cannot endure in his age
 shall quips and sentences and these paper bullets of
 the brain awe a man from the career of his humour
 no the world must be peopled when i said i would
