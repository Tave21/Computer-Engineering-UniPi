menenius why tis no great matter for a very little thief of
 occasion will rob you of a great deal of patience
 give your dispositions the reins and be angry at
 your pleasures at the least if you take it as a
 pleasure to you in being so you blame marcius for
 being proud
brutus we do it not alone sir
menenius i know you can do very little alone for your helps
 are many or else your actions would grow wondrous
 single your abilities are too infantlike for
 doing much alone you talk of pride o that you
 could turn your eyes toward the napes of your necks
 and make but an interior survey of your good selves
 o that you could
brutus what then sir
menenius why then you should discover a brace of unmeriting
 proud violent testy magistrates alias fools as
 any in rome
sicinius menenius you are known well enough too
menenius i am known to be a humorous patrician and one that
 loves a cup of hot wine with not a drop of allaying
 tiber in't said to be something imperfect in
 favouring the first complaint hasty and tinderlike
 upon too trivial motion one that converses more
 with the buttock of the night than with the forehead
 of the morning what i think i utter and spend my
 malice in my breath meeting two such wealsmen as
 you arei cannot call you lycurgusesif the drink
 you give me touch my palate adversely i make a
 crooked face at it i can't say your worships have
 delivered the matter well when i find the ass in
 compound with the major part of your syllables and
 though i must be content to bear with those that say
 you are reverend grave men yet they lie deadly that
 tell you you have good faces if you see this in
 the map of my microcosm follows it that i am known
 well enough too what barm can your bisson
 conspectuities glean out of this character if i be
 known well enough too
brutus come sir come we know you well enough
menenius you know neither me yourselves nor any thing you
 are ambitious for poor knaves caps and legs you
 wear out a good wholesome forenoon in hearing a
 cause between an orange wife and a fossetseller
 and then rejourn the controversy of three pence to a
 second day of audience when you are hearing a
 matter between party and party if you chance to be
 pinched with the colic you make faces like
 mummers set up the bloody flag against all
 patience and in roaring for a chamberpot
 dismiss the controversy bleeding the more entangled
 by your hearing all the peace you make in their
 cause is calling both the parties knaves you are
 a pair of strange ones
brutus come come you are well understood to be a
 perfecter giber for the table than a necessary
 bencher in the capitol
menenius our very priests must become mockers if they shall
 encounter such ridiculous subjects as you are when
 you speak best unto the purpose it is not worth the
 wagging of your beards and your beards deserve not
 so honourable a grave as to stuff a botcher's
 cushion or to be entombed in an ass's pack
 saddle yet you must be saying marcius is proud
 who in a cheap estimation is worth predecessors
 since deucalion though peradventure some of the
 best of em were hereditary hangmen godden to
 your worships more of your conversation would
 infect my brain being the herdsmen of the beastly
 plebeians i will be bold to take my leave of you
 brutus and sicinius go aside
 enter volumnia virgilia and valeria
 how now my as fair as noble ladiesand the moon
 were she earthly no noblerwhither do you follow
 your eyes so fast

virgilia yes certain there's a letter for you i saw't
menenius a letter for me it gives me an estate of seven
 years health in which time i will make a lip at
 the physician the most sovereign prescription in
 galen is but empiricutic and to this preservative
 of no better report than a horsedrench is he
 not wounded he was wont to come home wounded
virgilia o no no no
volumnia o he is wounded i thank the gods for't
menenius so do i too if it be not too much brings a'
 victory in his pocket the wounds become him
volumnia on's brows menenius he comes the third time home
 with the oaken garland
menenius has he disciplined aufidius soundly
volumnia titus lartius writes they fought together but
 aufidius got off
menenius and twas time for him too i'll warrant him that
 an he had stayed by him i would not have been so
 fidiused for all the chests in corioli and the gold
 that's in them is the senate possessed of this
volumnia good ladies let's go yes yes yes the senate
 has letters from the general wherein he gives my
 son the whole name of the war he hath in this
 action outdone his former deeds doubly
valeria in troth there's wondrous things spoke of him
menenius wondrous ay i warrant you and not without his
 true purchasing
virgilia the gods grant them true
volumnia true pow wow
menenius true i'll be sworn they are true
 where is he wounded
 to the tribunes
 god save your good worships marcius is coming
 home he has more cause to be proud where is he wounded
volumnia i the shoulder and i the left arm there will be
 large cicatrices to show the people when he shall
 stand for his place he received in the repulse of
 tarquin seven hurts i the body
menenius one i the neck and two i the thighthere's
 nine that i know
volumnia he had before this last expedition twentyfive
 wounds upon him
menenius now it's twentyseven every gash was an enemy's grave
 a shout and flourish
 hark the trumpets
volumnia these are the ushers of marcius before him he
 carries noise and behind him he leaves tears
 death that dark spirit in s nervy arm doth lie
 which being advanced declines and then men die
 a sennet trumpets sound enter cominius the
 general and titus lartius between them coriolanus
 crowned with an oaken garland with captains and
 soldiers and a herald
herald know rome that all alone marcius did fight
 within corioli gates where he hath won
 with fame a name to caius marcius these
 in honour follows coriolanus
 welcome to rome renowned coriolanus
 flourish
all welcome to rome renowned coriolanus
coriolanus no more of this it does offend my heart
 pray now no more
cominius look sir your mother
coriolanus o

 for my prosperity
 kneels
volumnia nay my good soldier up
 my gentle marcius worthy caius and

 but o thy wife
coriolanus my gracious silence hail
 wouldst thou have laugh'd had i come coffin'd home

 that rome should dote on yet by the faith of men
 we have some old crabtrees here
 at home that will not
 be grafted to your relish yet welcome warriors

 the faults of fools but folly
cominius ever right

herald give way there and go on
coriolanus to volumnia and virgilia your hand and yours
 ere in our own house i do shade my head
 the good patricians must be visited
 from whom i have received not only greetings
 but with them change of honours
volumnia i have lived
 to see inherited my very wishes
 and the buildings of my fancy only
 there's one thing wanting which i doubt not but
 our rome will cast upon thee
coriolanus know good mother
 i had rather be their servant in my way
 than sway with them in theirs
cominius on to the capitol
