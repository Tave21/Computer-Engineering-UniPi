 i cannot blame his conscience
first gentleman they that bear
 the cloth of honour over her are four barons
 of the cinqueports
second gentleman those men are happy and so are all are near her
 i take it she that carries up the train
 is that old noble lady duchess of norfolk
first gentleman it is and all the rest are countesses
second gentleman their coronets say so these are stars indeed
 and sometimes falling ones
first gentleman no more of that
 exit procession and then a great flourish of trumpets
 enter a third gentleman
first gentleman god save you sir where have you been broiling
third gentleman among the crowd i the abbey where a finger
 could not be wedged in more i am stifled
 with the mere rankness of their joy
second gentleman you saw
 the ceremony
third gentleman that i did
first gentleman how was it
third gentleman well worth the seeing
second gentleman good sir speak it to us
third gentleman as well as i am able the rich stream
 of lords and ladies having brought the queen
 to a prepared place in the choir fell off
 a distance from her while her grace sat down
 to rest awhile some half an hour or so
 in a rich chair of state opposing freely
 the beauty of her person to the people
 believe me sir she is the goodliest woman
 that ever lay by man which when the people
 had the full view of such a noise arose
 as the shrouds make at sea in a stiff tempest
 as loud and to as many tunes hats cloaks
 doublets i thinkflew up and had their faces
 been loose this day they had been lost such joy
 i never saw before greatbellied women
 that had not half a week to go like rams
 in the old time of war would shake the press
 and make em reel before em no man living
 could say this is my wife there all were woven
 so strangely in one piece
second gentleman but what follow'd
third gentleman at length her grace rose and with modest paces
 came to the altar where she kneel'd and saintlike
 cast her fair eyes to heaven and pray'd devoutly
 then rose again and bow'd her to the people
 when by the archbishop of canterbury
 she had all the royal makings of a queen
 as holy oil edward confessor's crown
 the rod and bird of peace and all such emblems
 laid nobly on her which perform'd the choir
 with all the choicest music of the kingdom
 together sung te deum so she parted
 and with the same full state paced back again
 to yorkplace where the feast is held
first gentleman sir
 you must no more call it yorkplace that's past
 for since the cardinal fell that title's lost
 tis now the king's and call'd whitehall
third gentleman i know it
 but tis so lately alter'd that the old name
 is fresh about me
second gentleman what two reverend bishops
 were those that went on each side of the queen
third gentleman stokesly and gardiner the one of winchester
 newly preferr'd from the king's secretary
 the other london
second gentleman he of winchester
 is held no great good lover of the archbishop's
 the virtuous cranmer
third gentleman all the land knows that
 however yet there is no great breach when it comes
 cranmer will find a friend will not shrink from him
second gentleman who may that be i pray you
third gentleman thomas cromwell
 a man in much esteem with the king and truly
 a worthy friend the king has made him master
 o the jewel house
 and one already of the privy council
second gentleman he will deserve more
third gentleman yes without all doubt
 come gentlemen ye shall go my way which
 is to the court and there ye shall be my guests
 something i can command as i walk thither
 i'll tell ye more
both you may command us sir

 king henry viii
act iv
scene ii kimbolton
 enter katharine dowager sick led between
 griffith her gentleman usher and patience her woman
griffith how does your grace
katharine o griffith sick to death
 my legs like loaden branches bow to the earth
 willing to leave their burthen reach a chair
 so now methinks i feel a little ease
 didst thou not tell me griffith as thou led'st me
 that the great child of honour cardinal wolsey was dead
griffith yes madam but i think your grace
 out of the pain you suffer'd gave no ear to't
katharine prithee good griffith tell me how he died
 if well he stepp'd before me happily
 for my example
griffith well the voice goes madam
 for after the stout earl northumberland
 arrested him at york and brought him forward
 as a man sorely tainted to his answer
 he fell sick suddenly and grew so ill
 he could not sit his mule
katharine alas poor man
griffith at last with easy roads he came to leicester
 lodged in the abbey where the reverend abbot
 with all his covent honourably received him
 to whom he gave these words o father abbot
 an old man broken with the storms of state
 is come to lay his weary bones among ye
 give him a little earth for charity'
 so went to bed where eagerly his sickness
 pursued him still and three nights after this
 about the hour of eight which he himself
 foretold should be his last full of repentance
 continual meditations tears and sorrows
 he gave his honours to the world again
 his blessed part to heaven and slept in peace
katharine so may he rest his faults lie gently on him
 yet thus far griffith give me leave to speak him
 and yet with charity he was a man
 of an unbounded stomach ever ranking
 himself with princes one that by suggestion
 tied all the kingdom simony was fairplay
 his own opinion was his law i the presence
 he would say untruths and be ever double
 both in his words and meaning he was never
 but where he meant to ruin pitiful
 his promises were as he then was mighty
 but his performance as he is now nothing
 of his own body he was ill and gave
 the clergy in example
griffith noble madam
 men's evil manners live in brass their virtues
 we write in water may it please your highness
 to hear me speak his good now
katharine yes good griffith
 i were malicious else
griffith this cardinal
 though from an humble stock undoubtedly
 was fashion'd to much honour from his cradle
 he was a scholar and a ripe and good one
 exceeding wise fairspoken and persuading
 lofty and sour to them that loved him not
 but to those men that sought him sweet as summer
 and though he were unsatisfied in getting
 which was a sin yet in bestowing madam
 he was most princely ever witness for him
 those twins of learning that he raised in you
 ipswich and oxford one of which fell with him
 unwilling to outlive the good that did it
 the other though unfinish'd yet so famous
 so excellent in art and still so rising
 that christendom shall ever speak his virtue
 his overthrow heap'd happiness upon him
 for then and not till then he felt himself
 and found the blessedness of being little
 and to add greater honours to his age
 than man could give him he died fearing god
katharine after my death i wish no other herald
 no other speaker of my living actions
 to keep mine honour from corruption
 but such an honest chronicler as griffith
 whom i most hated living thou hast made me
 with thy religious truth and modesty
 now in his ashes honour peace be with him
 patience be near me still and set me lower
 i have not long to trouble thee good griffith
 cause the musicians play me that sad note
 i named my knell whilst i sit meditating
 on that celestial harmony i go to
 sad and solemn music
griffith she is asleep good wench let's sit down quiet
 for fear we wake her softly gentle patience
 the vision enter solemnly tripping one after
 another six personages clad in white robes
 wearing on their heads garlands of bays and golden
 vizards on their faces branches of bays or palm in
 their hands they first congee unto her then
 dance and at certain changes the first two hold
 a spare garland over her head at which the other
 four make reverent curtsies then the two that held
 the garland deliver the same to the other next two
 who observe the same order in their changes and
 holding the garland over her head which done
 they deliver the same garland to the last two who
 likewise observe the same order at which as it
 were by inspiration she makes in her sleep signs
 of rejoicing and holdeth up her hands to heaven
 and so in their dancing vanish carrying the
 garland with them the music continues
