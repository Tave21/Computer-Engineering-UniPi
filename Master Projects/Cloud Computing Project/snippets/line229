brutus let me tell you cassius you yourself
 are much condemn'd to have an itching palm
 to sell and mart your offices for gold
 to undeservers
cassius i an itching palm
 you know that you are brutus that speak this
 or by the gods this speech were else your last
brutus the name of cassius honours this corruption
 and chastisement doth therefore hide his head
cassius chastisement
brutus remember march the ides of march remember
 did not great julius bleed for justice sake
 what villain touch'd his body that did stab
 and not for justice what shall one of us
 that struck the foremost man of all this world
 but for supporting robbers shall we now
 contaminate our fingers with base bribes
 and sell the mighty space of our large honours
 for so much trash as may be grasped thus
 i had rather be a dog and bay the moon
 than such a roman
cassius brutus bay not me
 i'll not endure it you forget yourself
 to hedge me in i am a soldier i
 older in practise abler than yourself
 to make conditions
brutus go to you are not cassius
cassius i am
brutus i say you are not
cassius urge me no more i shall forget myself
 have mind upon your health tempt me no further
brutus away slight man
cassius is't possible
brutus hear me for i will speak
 must i give way and room to your rash choler
 shall i be frighted when a madman stares
cassius o ye gods ye gods must i endure all this
brutus all this ay more fret till your proud heart break
 go show your slaves how choleric you are
 and make your bondmen tremble must i budge
 must i observe you must i stand and crouch
 under your testy humour by the gods
 you shall digest the venom of your spleen
 though it do split you for from this day forth
 i'll use you for my mirth yea for my laughter
 when you are waspish
cassius is it come to this
brutus you say you are a better soldier
 let it appear so make your vaunting true
 and it shall please me well for mine own part
 i shall be glad to learn of noble men
cassius you wrong me every way you wrong me brutus
 i said an elder soldier not a better
 did i say better'
brutus if you did i care not
cassius when caesar lived he durst not thus have moved me
brutus peace peace you durst not so have tempted him
cassius i durst not
brutus no
cassius what durst not tempt him
brutus for your life you durst not
cassius do not presume too much upon my love
 i may do that i shall be sorry for
brutus you have done that you should be sorry for
 there is no terror cassius in your threats
 for i am arm'd so strong in honesty
 that they pass by me as the idle wind
 which i respect not i did send to you
 for certain sums of gold which you denied me
 for i can raise no money by vile means
 by heaven i had rather coin my heart
 and drop my blood for drachmas than to wring
 from the hard hands of peasants their vile trash
 by any indirection i did send
 to you for gold to pay my legions
 which you denied me was that done like cassius
 should i have answer'd caius cassius so
 when marcus brutus grows so covetous
 to lock such rascal counters from his friends
 be ready gods with all your thunderbolts
 dash him to pieces
cassius i denied you not
brutus you did
cassius i did not he was but a fool that brought
 my answer back brutus hath rived my heart
 a friend should bear his friend's infirmities
 but brutus makes mine greater than they are
brutus i do not till you practise them on me
cassius you love me not
brutus i do not like your faults
cassius a friendly eye could never see such faults
brutus a flatterer's would not though they do appear
 as huge as high olympus
cassius come antony and young octavius come
 revenge yourselves alone on cassius
 for cassius is aweary of the world
 hated by one he loves braved by his brother
 cheque'd like a bondman all his faults observed
 set in a notebook learn'd and conn'd by rote
 to cast into my teeth o i could weep
 my spirit from mine eyes there is my dagger
 and here my naked breast within a heart
 dearer than plutus mine richer than gold
 if that thou be'st a roman take it forth
 i that denied thee gold will give my heart
 strike as thou didst at caesar for i know
 when thou didst hate him worst thou lovedst him better
 than ever thou lovedst cassius
brutus sheathe your dagger
 be angry when you will it shall have scope
 do what you will dishonour shall be humour
 o cassius you are yoked with a lamb
 that carries anger as the flint bears fire
 who much enforced shows a hasty spark
 and straight is cold again
cassius hath cassius lived
 to be but mirth and laughter to his brutus
 when grief and blood illtemper'd vexeth him
brutus when i spoke that i was illtemper'd too
cassius do you confess so much give me your hand
brutus and my heart too
cassius o brutus
brutus what's the matter
cassius have not you love enough to bear with me
 when that rash humour which my mother gave me
 makes me forgetful
brutus yes cassius and from henceforth
 when you are overearnest with your brutus
 he'll think your mother chides and leave you so
poet within let me go in to see the generals
 there is some grudge between em tis not meet
 they be alone
lucilius within you shall not come to them
poet within nothing but death shall stay me
 enter poet followed by lucilius titinius and lucius
cassius how now what's the matter
poet for shame you generals what do you mean
 love and be friends as two such men should be
 for i have seen more years i'm sure than ye
cassius ha ha how vilely doth this cynic rhyme
brutus get you hence sirrah saucy fellow hence
cassius bear with him brutus tis his fashion
brutus i'll know his humour when he knows his time
 what should the wars do with these jigging fools
 companion hence
cassius away away be gone
 exit poet
brutus lucilius and titinius bid the commanders
 prepare to lodge their companies tonight
cassius and come yourselves and bring messala with you
 immediately to us
 exeunt lucilius and titinius
brutus lucius a bowl of wine
 exit lucius
cassius i did not think you could have been so angry
brutus o cassius i am sick of many griefs
cassius of your philosophy you make no use
 if you give place to accidental evils
brutus no man bears sorrow better portia is dead
cassius ha portia
brutus she is dead
cassius how scaped i killing when i cross'd you so
 o insupportable and touching loss
 upon what sickness
brutus impatient of my absence
 and grief that young octavius with mark antony
 have made themselves so strongfor with her death
 that tidings camewith this she fell distract
 and her attendants absent swallow'd fire
cassius and died so
brutus even so
cassius o ye immortal gods
 reenter lucius with wine and taper
brutus speak no more of her give me a bowl of wine
 in this i bury all unkindness cassius
cassius my heart is thirsty for that noble pledge
 fill lucius till the wine o'erswell the cup
 i cannot drink too much of brutus love
brutus come in titinius
 exit lucius
 reenter titinius with messala
 welcome good messala
 now sit we close about this taper here
 and call in question our necessities
cassius portia art thou gone
brutus no more i pray you
 messala i have here received letters
 that young octavius and mark antony
 come down upon us with a mighty power
 bending their expedition toward philippi
messala myself have letters of the selfsame tenor
brutus with what addition
messala that by proscription and bills of outlawry
 octavius antony and lepidus
 have put to death an hundred senators
brutus therein our letters do not well agree
 mine speak of seventy senators that died
 by their proscriptions cicero being one
cassius cicero one
messala cicero is dead
