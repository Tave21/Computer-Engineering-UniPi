act v
scene iii rousillon the count's palace
 flourish enter king countess lafeu the two
 french lords with attendants
king we lost a jewel of her and our esteem
 was made much poorer by it but your son
 as mad in folly lack'd the sense to know
 her estimation home
countess tis past my liege
 and i beseech your majesty to make it
 natural rebellion done i the blaze of youth
 when oil and fire too strong for reason's force
 o'erbears it and burns on
king my honour'd lady
 i have forgiven and forgotten all
 though my revenges were high bent upon him
 and watch'd the time to shoot
lafeu this i must say
 but first i beg my pardon the young lord
 did to his majesty his mother and his lady
 offence of mighty note but to himself
 the greatest wrong of all he lost a wife
 whose beauty did astonish the survey
 of richest eyes whose words all ears took captive
 whose dear perfection hearts that scorn'd to serve
 humbly call'd mistress
king praising what is lost
 makes the remembrance dear well call him hither
 we are reconciled and the first view shall kill
 all repetition let him not ask our pardon
 the nature of his great offence is dead
 and deeper than oblivion we do bury
 the incensing relics of it let him approach
 a stranger no offender and inform him
 so tis our will he should
gentleman i shall my liege
 exit
king what says he to your daughter have you spoke
lafeu all that he is hath reference to your highness
king then shall we have a match i have letters sent me
 that set him high in fame
 enter bertram
lafeu he looks well on't
king i am not a day of season
 for thou mayst see a sunshine and a hail
 in me at once but to the brightest beams
 distracted clouds give way so stand thou forth
 the time is fair again
bertram my highrepented blames
 dear sovereign pardon to me
king all is whole
 not one word more of the consumed time
 let's take the instant by the forward top
 for we are old and on our quick'st decrees
 the inaudible and noiseless foot of time
 steals ere we can effect them you remember
 the daughter of this lord
bertram admiringly my liege at first
 i stuck my choice upon her ere my heart
 durst make too bold a herald of my tongue
 where the impression of mine eye infixing
 contempt his scornful perspective did lend me
 which warp'd the line of every other favour
 scorn'd a fair colour or express'd it stolen
 extended or contracted all proportions
 to a most hideous object thence it came
 that she whom all men praised and whom myself
 since i have lost have loved was in mine eye
 the dust that did offend it
king well excused
 that thou didst love her strikes some scores away
 from the great compt but love that comes too late
 like a remorseful pardon slowly carried
 to the great sender turns a sour offence
 crying that's good that's gone our rash faults
 make trivial price of serious things we have
 not knowing them until we know their grave
 oft our displeasures to ourselves unjust
 destroy our friends and after weep their dust
 our own love waking cries to see what's done
 while shame full late sleeps out the afternoon
 be this sweet helen's knell and now forget her
 send forth your amorous token for fair maudlin
 the main consents are had and here we'll stay
 to see our widower's second marriageday
countess which better than the first o dear heaven bless
 or ere they meet in me o nature cesse
lafeu come on my son in whom my house's name
 must be digested give a favour from you
 to sparkle in the spirits of my daughter
 that she may quickly come
