burgundy who craves a parley with the burgundy
joan la pucelle the princely charles of france thy countryman
burgundy what say'st thou charles for i am marching hence
charles speak pucelle and enchant him with thy words
joan la pucelle brave burgundy undoubted hope of france
 stay let thy humble handmaid speak to thee
burgundy speak on but be not overtedious
joan la pucelle look on thy country look on fertile france
 and see the cities and the towns defaced
 by wasting ruin of the cruel foe
 as looks the mother on her lowly babe
 when death doth close his tender dying eyes
 see see the pining malady of france
 behold the wounds the most unnatural wounds
 which thou thyself hast given her woful breast
 o turn thy edged sword another way
 strike those that hurt and hurt not those that help
 one drop of blood drawn from thy country's bosom
 should grieve thee more than streams of foreign gore
 return thee therefore with a flood of tears
 and wash away thy country's stained spots
burgundy either she hath bewitch'd me with her words
 or nature makes me suddenly relent
joan la pucelle besides all french and france exclaims on thee
 doubting thy birth and lawful progeny
 who joint'st thou with but with a lordly nation
 that will not trust thee but for profit's sake
 when talbot hath set footing once in france
 and fashion'd thee that instrument of ill
 who then but english henry will be lord
 and thou be thrust out like a fugitive
 call we to mind and mark but this for proof
 was not the duke of orleans thy foe
 and was he not in england prisoner
 but when they heard he was thine enemy
 they set him free without his ransom paid
 in spite of burgundy and all his friends
 see then thou fight'st against thy countrymen
 and joint'st with them will be thy slaughtermen
 come come return return thou wandering lord
 charles and the rest will take thee in their arms
burgundy i am vanquished these haughty words of hers
 have batter'd me like roaring cannonshot
 and made me almost yield upon my knees
 forgive me country and sweet countrymen
 and lords accept this hearty kind embrace
 my forces and my power of men are yours
 so farewell talbot i'll no longer trust thee
joan la pucelle aside done like a frenchman turn and turn again
charles welcome brave duke thy friendship makes us fresh
bastard of orleans and doth beget new courage in our breasts
alencon pucelle hath bravely play'd her part in this
 and doth deserve a coronet of gold
charles now let us on my lords and join our powers
 and seek how we may prejudice the foe

 that hath so long been resident in france

king henry vi welcome brave captain and victorious lord
 when i was young as yet i am not old
 i do remember how my father said

 enter fastolfe
fastolfe my gracious sovereign as i rode from calais
 to haste unto your coronation
 a letter was deliver'd to my hands
 writ to your grace from the duke of burgundy
talbot shame to the duke of burgundy and thee
 i vow'd base knight when i did meet thee next
 to tear the garter from thy craven's leg
 plucking it off
 which i have done because unworthily
 thou wast installed in that high degree
 pardon me princely henry and the rest
 this dastard at the battle of patay
 when but in all i was six thousand strong
 and that the french were almost ten to one
 before we met or that a stroke was given
 like to a trusty squire did run away
 in which assault we lost twelve hundred men
 myself and divers gentlemen beside
 were there surprised and taken prisoners
 then judge great lords if i have done amiss
 or whether that such cowards ought to wear
 this ornament of knighthood yea or no
gloucester to say the truth this fact was infamous
 and ill beseeming any common man
 much more a knight a captain and a leader
talbot when first this order was ordain'd my lords
 knights of the garter were of noble birth
 valiant and virtuous full of haughty courage
 such as were grown to credit by the wars
 not fearing death nor shrinking for distress
 but always resolute in most extremes
 he then that is not furnish'd in this sort
 doth but usurp the sacred name of knight
 profaning this most honourable order
 and should if i were worthy to be judge
 be quite degraded like a hedgeborn swain
 that doth presume to boast of gentle blood
king henry vi stain to thy countrymen thou hear'st thy doom
 be packing therefore thou that wast a knight
 henceforth we banish thee on pain of death
 exit fastolfe
 and now my lord protector view the letter
 sent from our uncle duke of burgundy
gloucester what means his grace that he hath changed his style
 no more but plain and bluntly to the king'
 hath he forgot he is his sovereign
 or doth this churlish superscription
 pretend some alteration in good will
 what's here
 reads
 i have upon especial cause
 moved with compassion of my country's wreck
 together with the pitiful complaints
 of such as your oppression feeds upon
 forsaken your pernicious faction
 and join'd with charles the rightful king of france'
 o monstrous treachery can this be so
 that in alliance amity and oaths
 there should be found such false dissembling guile
king henry vi what doth my uncle burgundy revolt
gloucester he doth my lord and is become your foe
king henry vi is that the worst this letter doth contain
gloucester it is the worst and all my lord he writes
king henry vi why then lord talbot there shall talk with him
 and give him chastisement for this abuse
 how say you my lord are you not content
talbot content my liege yes but that i am prevented
 i should have begg'd i might have been employ'd
king henry vi then gather strength and march unto him straight
 let him perceive how ill we brook his treason
 and what offence it is to flout his friends
talbot i go my lord in heart desiring still
