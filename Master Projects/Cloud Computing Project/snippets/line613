 i will lay him down such reasons for this adventure
 that he shall go
falstaff well god give thee the spirit of persuasion and him
 the ears of profiting that what thou speakest may
 move and what he hears may be believed that the
 true prince may for recreation sake prove a false
 thief for the poor abuses of the time want
 countenance farewell you shall find me in eastcheap
prince henry farewell thou latter spring farewell allhallown summer
 exit falstaff
poins now my good sweet honey lord ride with us
 tomorrow i have a jest to execute that i cannot
 manage alone falstaff bardolph peto and gadshill
 shall rob those men that we have already waylaid
 yourself and i will not be there and when they
 have the booty if you and i do not rob them cut
 this head off from my shoulders
prince henry how shall we part with them in setting forth
poins why we will set forth before or after them and
 appoint them a place of meeting wherein it is at
 our pleasure to fail and then will they adventure
 upon the exploit themselves which they shall have
 no sooner achieved but we'll set upon them
prince henry yea but tis like that they will know us by our
 horses by our habits and by every other
 appointment to be ourselves
poins tut our horses they shall not see i'll tie them
 in the wood our vizards we will change after we
 leave them and sirrah i have cases of buckram
 for the nonce to immask our noted outward garments
prince henry yea but i doubt they will be too hard for us
poins well for two of them i know them to be as
 truebred cowards as ever turned back and for the
 third if he fight longer than he sees reason i'll
 forswear arms the virtue of this jest will be the
 incomprehensible lies that this same fat rogue will
 tell us when we meet at supper how thirty at
 least he fought with what wards what blows what
 extremities he endured and in the reproof of this
 lies the jest
prince henry well i'll go with thee provide us all things
 necessary and meet me tomorrow night in eastcheap
 there i'll sup farewell
poins farewell my lord
 exit poins
prince henry i know you all and will awhile uphold
 the unyoked humour of your idleness
 yet herein will i imitate the sun
 who doth permit the base contagious clouds
 to smother up his beauty from the world
 that when he please again to be himself
 being wanted he may be more wonder'd at
 by breaking through the foul and ugly mists
 of vapours that did seem to strangle him
 if all the year were playing holidays
 to sport would be as tedious as to work
 but when they seldom come they wish'd for come
 and nothing pleaseth but rare accidents
 so when this loose behavior i throw off
 and pay the debt i never promised
 by how much better than my word i am
 by so much shall i falsify men's hopes
 and like bright metal on a sullen ground
 my reformation glittering o'er my fault
 shall show more goodly and attract more eyes
 than that which hath no foil to set it off
 i'll so offend to make offence a skill
 redeeming time when men think least i will

 1 king henry iv
act i
scene iii london the palace
 enter the king northumberland worcester hotspur
 sir walter blunt with others
king henry iv my blood hath been too cold and temperate
 unapt to stir at these indignities
 and you have found me for accordingly
 you tread upon my patience but be sure
 i will from henceforth rather be myself
 mighty and to be fear'd than my condition
 which hath been smooth as oil soft as young down
 and therefore lost that title of respect
 which the proud soul ne'er pays but to the proud
earl of worcester our house my sovereign liege little deserves
 the scourge of greatness to be used on it
 and that same greatness too which our own hands
 have holp to make so portly
northumberland my lord
king henry iv worcester get thee gone for i do see
 danger and disobedience in thine eye
 o sir your presence is too bold and peremptory
 and majesty might never yet endure
 the moody frontier of a servant brow
 you have good leave to leave us when we need
 your use and counsel we shall send for you
 exit worcester
 you were about to speak
 to north
northumberland yea my good lord
 those prisoners in your highness name demanded
 which harry percy here at holmedon took
 were as he says not with such strength denied
 as is deliver'd to your majesty
 either envy therefore or misprison
 is guilty of this fault and not my son
hotspur my liege i did deny no prisoners
 but i remember when the fight was done
 when i was dry with rage and extreme toil
 breathless and faint leaning upon my sword
 came there a certain lord neat and trimly dress'd
 fresh as a bridegroom and his chin new reap'd
 show'd like a stubbleland at harvesthome
 he was perfumed like a milliner
 and twixt his finger and his thumb he held
 a pouncetbox which ever and anon
 he gave his nose and took't away again
 who therewith angry when it next came there
 took it in snuff and still he smiled and talk'd
 and as the soldiers bore dead bodies by
 he call'd them untaught knaves unmannerly
 to bring a slovenly unhandsome corse
 betwixt the wind and his nobility
 with many holiday and lady terms
 he question'd me amongst the rest demanded
 my prisoners in your majesty's behalf
 i then all smarting with my wounds being cold
 to be so pester'd with a popinjay
 out of my grief and my impatience
 answer'd neglectingly i know not what
 he should or he should not for he made me mad
 to see him shine so brisk and smell so sweet
 and talk so like a waitinggentlewoman
 of guns and drums and woundsgod save the mark
 and telling me the sovereign'st thing on earth
 was parmaceti for an inward bruise
 and that it was great pity so it was
 this villanous saltpetre should be digg'd
 out of the bowels of the harmless earth
 which many a good tall fellow had destroy'd
 so cowardly and but for these vile guns
 he would himself have been a soldier
 this bald unjointed chat of his my lord
 i answer'd indirectly as i said
 and i beseech you let not his report
 come current for an accusation
 betwixt my love and your high majesty
sir walter blunt the circumstance consider'd good my lord
 whate'er lord harry percy then had said
 to such a person and in such a place
 at such a time with all the rest retold
 may reasonably die and never rise
 to do him wrong or any way impeach
 what then he said so he unsay it now
king henry iv why yet he doth deny his prisoners
 but with proviso and exception
 that we at our own charge shall ransom straight
 his brotherinlaw the foolish mortimer
 who on my soul hath wilfully betray'd
 the lives of those that he did lead to fight
 against that great magician damn'd glendower
 whose daughter as we hear the earl of march
 hath lately married shall our coffers then
 be emptied to redeem a traitor home
 shall we but treason and indent with fears
 when they have lost and forfeited themselves
 no on the barren mountains let him starve
 for i shall never hold that man my friend
 whose tongue shall ask me for one penny cost
 to ransom home revolted mortimer
hotspur revolted mortimer
 he never did fall off my sovereign liege
 but by the chance of war to prove that true
 needs no more but one tongue for all those wounds
 those mouthed wounds which valiantly he took
 when on the gentle severn's sedgy bank
 in single opposition hand to hand
 he did confound the best part of an hour
 in changing hardiment with great glendower
 three times they breathed and three times did
 they drink
 upon agreement of swift severn's flood
 who then affrighted with their bloody looks
 ran fearfully among the trembling reeds
 and hid his crisp head in the hollow bank
 bloodstained with these valiant combatants
 never did base and rotten policy
