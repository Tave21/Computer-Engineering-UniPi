i understand more than the ancients because i keep thy precepts
i have refrained my feet from every evil way that i might keep thy word
i have not departed from thy judgments for thou hast taught me
how sweet are thy words unto my taste yea sweeter than honey to my mouth
through thy precepts i get understanding therefore i hate every false way
thy word is a lamp unto my feet and a light unto my path
i have sworn and i will perform it that i will keep thy righteous judgments
i am afflicted very much quicken me o lord according unto thy word
accept i beseech thee the freewill offerings of my mouth o lord and teach me thy judgments
my soul is continually in my hand yet do i not forget thy law
the wicked have laid a snare for me yet i erred not from thy precepts
thy testimonies have i taken as an heritage for ever for they are the rejoicing of my heart
i have inclined mine heart to perform thy statutes alway even unto the end
i hate vain thoughts but thy law do i love
thou art my hiding place and my shield i hope in thy word
depart from me ye evildoers for i will keep the commandments of my god
uphold me according unto thy word that i may live and let me not be ashamed of my hope
hold thou me up and i shall be safe and i will have respect unto thy statutes continually
thou hast trodden down all them that err from thy statutes for their deceit is falsehood
thou puttest away all the wicked of the earth like dross therefore i love thy testimonies
my flesh trembleth for fear of thee and i am afraid of thy judgments
i have done judgment and justice leave me not to mine oppressors
be surety for thy servant for good let not the proud oppress me
mine eyes fail for thy salvation and for the word of thy righteousness
deal with thy servant according unto thy mercy and teach me thy statutes
i am thy servant give me understanding that i may know thy testimonies
it is time for thee lord to work for they have made void thy law
therefore i love thy commandments above gold yea above fine gold
therefore i esteem all thy precepts concerning all things to be right and i hate every false way
thy testimonies are wonderful therefore doth my soul keep them
the entrance of thy words giveth light it giveth understanding unto the simple
i opened my mouth and panted for i longed for thy commandments
look thou upon me and be merciful unto me as thou usest to do unto those that love thy name
order my steps in thy word and let not any iniquity have dominion over me
deliver me from the oppression of man so will i keep thy precepts
make thy face to shine upon thy servant and teach me thy statutes
rivers of waters run down mine eyes because they keep not thy law
righteous art thou o lord and upright are thy judgments
thy testimonies that thou hast commanded are righteous and very faithful
my zeal hath consumed me because mine enemies have forgotten thy words
thy word is very pure therefore thy servant loveth it
i am small and despised yet do not i forget thy precepts
thy righteousness is an everlasting righteousness and thy law is the truth
trouble and anguish have taken hold on me yet thy commandments are my delights
the righteousness of thy testimonies is everlasting give me understanding and i shall live
i cried with my whole heart hear me o lord i will keep thy statutes
i cried unto thee save me and i shall keep thy testimonies
i prevented the dawning of the morning and cried i hoped in thy word
mine eyes prevent the night watches that i might meditate in thy word
hear my voice according unto thy lovingkindness o lord quicken me according to thy judgment
they draw nigh that follow after mischief they are far from thy law
thou art near o lord and all thy commandments are truth
concerning thy testimonies i have known of old that thou hast founded them for ever
consider mine affliction and deliver me for i do not forget thy law
plead my cause and deliver me quicken me according to thy word
salvation is far from the wicked for they seek not thy statutes
great are thy tender mercies o lord quicken me according to thy judgments
many are my persecutors and mine enemies yet do i not decline from thy testimonies
i beheld the transgressors and was grieved because they kept not thy word
consider how i love thy precepts quicken me o lord according to thy lovingkindness
thy word is true from the beginning and every one of thy righteous judgments endureth for ever
princes have persecuted me without a cause but my heart standeth in awe of thy word
i rejoice at thy word as one that findeth great spoil
i hate and abhor lying but thy law do i love
seven times a day do i praise thee because of thy righteous judgments
great peace have they which love thy law and nothing shall offend them
lord i have hoped for thy salvation and done thy commandments
my soul hath kept thy testimonies and i love them exceedingly
i have kept thy precepts and thy testimonies for all my ways are before thee
let my cry come near before thee o lord give me understanding according to thy word
let my supplication come before thee deliver me according to thy word
my lips shall utter praise when thou hast taught me thy statutes
my tongue shall speak of thy word for all thy commandments are righteousness
let thine hand help me for i have chosen thy precepts
i have longed for thy salvation o lord and thy law is my delight
let my soul live and it shall praise thee and let thy judgments help me
i have gone astray like a lost sheep seek thy servant for i do not forget thy commandments
in my distress i cried unto the lord and he heard me
deliver my soul o lord from lying lips and from a deceitful tongue
what shall be given unto thee or what shall be done unto thee thou false tongue
sharp arrows of the mighty with coals of juniper
woe is me that i sojourn in mesech that i dwell in the tents of kedar
my soul hath long dwelt with him that hateth peace
i am for peace but when i speak they are for war
i will lift up mine eyes unto the hills from whence cometh my help
my help cometh from the lord which made heaven and earth
he will not suffer thy foot to be moved he that keepeth thee will not slumber
behold he that keepeth israel shall neither slumber nor sleep
the lord is thy keeper the lord is thy shade upon thy right hand
the sun shall not smite thee by day nor the moon by night
the lord shall preserve thee from all evil he shall preserve thy soul
the lord shall preserve thy going out and thy coming in from this time forth and even for evermore
i was glad when they said unto me let us go into the house of the lord
our feet shall stand within thy gates o jerusalem
jerusalem is builded as a city that is compact together
whither the tribes go up the tribes of the lord unto the testimony of israel to give thanks unto the name of the lord
for there are set thrones of judgment the thrones of the house of david
pray for the peace of jerusalem they shall prosper that love thee
peace be within thy walls and prosperity within thy palaces
for my brethren and companions sakes i will now say peace be within thee
because of the house of the lord our god i will seek thy good
unto thee lift i up mine eyes o thou that dwellest in the heavens
behold as the eyes of servants look unto the hand of their masters and as the eyes of a maiden unto the hand of her mistress so our eyes wait upon the lord our god until that he have mercy upon us
have mercy upon us o lord have mercy upon us for we are exceedingly filled with contempt
our soul is exceedingly filled with the scorning of those that are at ease and with the contempt of the proud
if it had not been the lord who was on our side now may israel say
if it had not been the lord who was on our side when men rose up against us
then they had swallowed us up quick when their wrath was kindled against us
then the waters had overwhelmed us the stream had gone over our soul
then the proud waters had gone over our soul
blessed be the lord who hath not given us as a prey to their teeth
our soul is escaped as a bird out of the snare of the fowlers the snare is broken and we are escaped
our help is in the name of the lord who made heaven and earth
they that trust in the lord shall be as mount zion which cannot be removed but abideth for ever
as the mountains are round about jerusalem so the lord is round about his people from henceforth even for ever
for the rod of the wicked shall not rest upon the lot of the righteous lest the righteous put forth their hands unto iniquity
do good o lord unto those that be good and to them that are upright in their hearts
as for such as turn aside unto their crooked ways the lord shall lead them forth with the workers of iniquity but peace shall be upon israel
when the lord turned again the captivity of zion we were like them that dream
then was our mouth filled with laughter and our tongue with singing then said they among the heathen the lord hath done great things for them
the lord hath done great things for us whereof we are glad
turn again our captivity o lord as the streams in the south
they that sow in tears shall reap in joy
he that goeth forth and weepeth bearing precious seed shall doubtless come again with rejoicing bringing his sheaves with him
except the lord build the house they labour in vain that build it except the lord keep the city the watchman waketh but in vain
it is vain for you to rise up early to sit up late to eat the bread of sorrows for so he giveth his beloved sleep
lo children are an heritage of the lord and the fruit of the womb is his reward
as arrows are in the hand of a mighty man so are children of the youth
happy is the man that hath his quiver full of them they shall not be ashamed but they shall speak with the enemies in the gate
blessed is every one that feareth the lord that walketh in his ways
for thou shalt eat the labour of thine hands happy shalt thou be and it shall be well with thee
thy wife shall be as a fruitful vine by the sides of thine house thy children like olive plants round about thy table
behold that thus shall the man be blessed that feareth the lord
the lord shall bless thee out of zion and thou shalt see the good of jerusalem all the days of thy life
yea thou shalt see thy children's children and peace upon israel
many a time have they afflicted me from my youth may israel now say
many a time have they afflicted me from my youth yet they have not prevailed against me
the plowers plowed upon my back they made long their furrows
the lord is righteous he hath cut asunder the cords of the wicked
let them all be confounded and turned back that hate zion
let them be as the grass upon the housetops which withereth afore it groweth up
wherewith the mower filleth not his hand nor he that bindeth sheaves his bosom
neither do they which go by say the blessing of the lord be upon you we bless you in the name of the lord
out of the depths have i cried unto thee o lord
lord hear my voice let thine ears be attentive to the voice of my supplications
if thou lord shouldest mark iniquities o lord who shall stand
but there is forgiveness with thee that thou mayest be feared
i wait for the lord my soul doth wait and in his word do i hope
my soul waiteth for the lord more than they that watch for the morning i say more than they that watch for the morning
let israel hope in the lord for with the lord there is mercy and with him is plenteous redemption
and he shall redeem israel from all his iniquities
lord my heart is not haughty nor mine eyes lofty neither do i exercise myself in great matters or in things too high for me
surely i have behaved and quieted myself as a child that is weaned of his mother my soul is even as a weaned child
let israel hope in the lord from henceforth and for ever
lord remember david and all his afflictions
how he sware unto the lord and vowed unto the mighty god of jacob
surely i will not come into the tabernacle of my house nor go up into my bed
i will not give sleep to mine eyes or slumber to mine eyelids
until i find out a place for the lord an habitation for the mighty god of jacob
lo we heard of it at ephratah we found it in the fields of the wood
we will go into his tabernacles we will worship at his footstool
arise o lord into thy rest thou and the ark of thy strength
let thy priests be clothed with righteousness and let thy saints shout for joy
for thy servant david's sake turn not away the face of thine anointed
the lord hath sworn in truth unto david he will not turn from it of the fruit of thy body will i set upon thy throne
if thy children will keep my covenant and my testimony that i shall teach them their children shall also sit upon thy throne for evermore
for the lord hath chosen zion he hath desired it for his habitation
this is my rest for ever here will i dwell for i have desired it
i will abundantly bless her provision i will satisfy her poor with bread
i will also clothe her priests with salvation and her saints shall shout aloud for joy
there will i make the horn of david to bud i have ordained a lamp for mine anointed
his enemies will i clothe with shame but upon himself shall his crown flourish
behold how good and how pleasant it is for brethren to dwell together in unity
it is like the precious ointment upon the head that ran down upon the beard even aaron's beard that went down to the skirts of his garments
as the dew of hermon and as the dew that descended upon the mountains of zion for there the lord commanded the blessing even life for evermore
behold bless ye the lord all ye servants of the lord which by night stand in the house of the lord
lift up your hands in the sanctuary and bless the lord
the lord that made heaven and earth bless thee out of zion
praise ye the lord praise ye the name of the lord praise him o ye servants of the lord
ye that stand in the house of the lord in the courts of the house of our god
praise the lord for the lord is good sing praises unto his name for it is pleasant
for the lord hath chosen jacob unto himself and israel for his peculiar treasure
for i know that the lord is great and that our lord is above all gods
whatsoever the lord pleased that did he in heaven and in earth in the seas and all deep places
he causeth the vapours to ascend from the ends of the earth he maketh lightnings for the rain he bringeth the wind out of his treasuries
who smote the firstborn of egypt both of man and beast
who sent tokens and wonders into the midst of thee o egypt upon pharaoh and upon all his servants
who smote great nations and slew mighty kings
sihon king of the amorites and og king of bashan and all the kingdoms of canaan
and gave their land for an heritage an heritage unto israel his people
thy name o lord endureth for ever and thy memorial o lord throughout all generations
for the lord will judge his people and he will repent himself concerning his servants
the idols of the heathen are silver and gold the work of men's hands
they have mouths but they speak not eyes have they but they see not
they have ears but they hear not neither is there any breath in their mouths
they that make them are like unto them so is every one that trusteth in them
bless the lord o house of israel bless the lord o house of aaron
bless the lord o house of levi ye that fear the lord bless the lord
blessed be the lord out of zion which dwelleth at jerusalem praise ye the lord
o give thanks unto the lord for he is good for his mercy endureth for ever
