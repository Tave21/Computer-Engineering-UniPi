 1 king henry vi
act i
scene i westminster abbey
 dead march enter the funeral of king henry the
 fifth attended on by dukes of bedford regent of
 france gloucester protector and exeter earl of
 warwick the bishop of winchester heralds &c
bedford hung be the heavens with black yield day to night
 comets importing change of times and states
 brandish your crystal tresses in the sky
 and with them scourge the bad revolting stars
 that have consented unto henry's death
 king henry the fifth too famous to live long
 england ne'er lost a king of so much worth
gloucester england ne'er had a king until his time
 virtue he had deserving to command
 his brandish'd sword did blind men with his beams
 his arms spread wider than a dragon's wings
 his sparking eyes replete with wrathful fire
 more dazzled and drove back his enemies
 than midday sun fierce bent against their faces
 what should i say his deeds exceed all speech
 he ne'er lift up his hand but conquered
exeter we mourn in black why mourn we not in blood
 henry is dead and never shall revive
 upon a wooden coffin we attend
 and death's dishonourable victory
 we with our stately presence glorify
 like captives bound to a triumphant car
 what shall we curse the planets of mishap
 that plotted thus our glory's overthrow
 or shall we think the subtlewitted french
 conjurers and sorcerers that afraid of him
 by magic verses have contrived his end
bishop
of winchester he was a king bless'd of the king of kings
 unto the french the dreadful judgementday
 so dreadful will not be as was his sight
 the battles of the lord of hosts he fought
 the church's prayers made him so prosperous
gloucester the church where is it had not churchmen pray'd
 his thread of life had not so soon decay'd
 none do you like but an effeminate prince
 whom like a schoolboy you may overawe
bishop
of winchester gloucester whate'er we like thou art protector
 and lookest to command the prince and realm
 thy wife is proud she holdeth thee in awe
 more than god or religious churchmen may
gloucester name not religion for thou lovest the flesh
 and ne'er throughout the year to church thou go'st
 except it be to pray against thy foes
bedford cease cease these jars and rest your minds in peace
 let's to the altar heralds wait on us
 instead of gold we'll offer up our arms
 since arms avail not now that henry's dead
 posterity await for wretched years
 when at their mothers moist eyes babes shall suck
 our isle be made a nourish of salt tears
 and none but women left to wail the dead
 henry the fifth thy ghost i invocate
 prosper this realm keep it from civil broils
 combat with adverse planets in the heavens
 a far more glorious star thy soul will make
 than julius caesar or bright
 enter a messenger
messenger my honourable lords health to you all
 sad tidings bring i to you out of france
 of loss of slaughter and discomfiture
 guienne champagne rheims orleans
 paris guysors poictiers are all quite lost
bedford what say'st thou man before dead henry's corse
 speak softly or the loss of those great towns
 will make him burst his lead and rise from death
gloucester is paris lost is rouen yielded up
 if henry were recall'd to life again
 these news would cause him once more yield the ghost
exeter how were they lost what treachery was used
messenger no treachery but want of men and money
 amongst the soldiers this is muttered
 that here you maintain several factions
 and whilst a field should be dispatch'd and fought
 you are disputing of your generals
 one would have lingering wars with little cost
 another would fly swift but wanteth wings
 a third thinks without expense at all
 by guileful fair words peace may be obtain'd
 awake awake english nobility
 let not sloth dim your horrors newbegot
 cropp'd are the flowerdeluces in your arms
 of england's coat one half is cut away
exeter were our tears wanting to this funeral
 these tidings would call forth their flowing tides
bedford me they concern regent i am of france
 give me my steeled coat i'll fight for france
 away with these disgraceful wailing robes
 wounds will i lend the french instead of eyes
 to weep their intermissive miseries
 enter to them another messenger
messenger lords view these letters full of bad mischance
 france is revolted from the english quite
 except some petty towns of no import
 the dauphin charles is crowned king of rheims
 the bastard of orleans with him is join'd
 reignier duke of anjou doth take his part
 the duke of alencon flieth to his side
exeter the dauphin crowned king all fly to him
 o whither shall we fly from this reproach
gloucester we will not fly but to our enemies throats
 bedford if thou be slack i'll fight it out
bedford gloucester why doubt'st thou of my forwardness
 an army have i muster'd in my thoughts
 wherewith already france is overrun
 enter another messenger
messenger my gracious lords to add to your laments
 wherewith you now bedew king henry's hearse
 i must inform you of a dismal fight
 betwixt the stout lord talbot and the french
bishop
of winchester what wherein talbot overcame is't so
messenger o no wherein lord talbot was o'erthrown
 the circumstance i'll tell you more at large
 the tenth of august last this dreadful lord
