 to make a shaking fever in your walls
 they shoot but calm words folded up in smoke
 to make a faithless error in your ears
 which trust accordingly kind citizens
 and let us in your king whose labour'd spirits
 forwearied in this action of swift speed
 crave harbourage within your city walls
king philip when i have said make answer to us both
 lo in this right hand whose protection
 is most divinely vow'd upon the right
 of him it holds stands young plantagenet
 son to the elder brother of this man
 and king o'er him and all that he enjoys
 for this downtrodden equity we tread
 in warlike march these greens before your town
 being no further enemy to you
 than the constraint of hospitable zeal
 in the relief of this oppressed child
 religiously provokes be pleased then
 to pay that duty which you truly owe
 to that owes it namely this young prince
 and then our arms like to a muzzled bear
 save in aspect hath all offence seal'd up
 our cannons malice vainly shall be spent
 against the invulnerable clouds of heaven
 and with a blessed and unvex'd retire
 with unhack'd swords and helmets all unbruised
 we will bear home that lusty blood again
 which here we came to spout against your town
 and leave your children wives and you in peace
 but if you fondly pass our proffer'd offer
 tis not the roundure of your oldfaced walls
 can hide you from our messengers of war
 though all these english and their discipline
 were harbour'd in their rude circumference
 then tell us shall your city call us lord
 in that behalf which we have challenged it
 or shall we give the signal to our rage
 and stalk in blood to our possession
first citizen in brief we are the king of england's subjects
 for him and in his right we hold this town
king john acknowledge then the king and let me in
first citizen that can we not but he that proves the king
 to him will we prove loyal till that time
 have we ramm'd up our gates against the world
king john doth not the crown of england prove the king
 and if not that i bring you witnesses
 twice fifteen thousand hearts of england's breed
bastard bastards and else
king john to verify our title with their lives
king philip as many and as wellborn bloods as those
bastard some bastards too
king philip stand in his face to contradict his claim
first citizen till you compound whose right is worthiest
 we for the worthiest hold the right from both
king john then god forgive the sin of all those souls
 that to their everlasting residence
 before the dew of evening fall shall fleet
 in dreadful trial of our kingdom's king
king philip amen amen mount chevaliers to arms
bastard saint george that swinged the dragon and e'er since
 sits on his horseback at mine hostess door
 teach us some fence
 to austria
 sirrah were i at home
 at your den sirrah with your lioness
 i would set an oxhead to your lion's hide
 and make a monster of you
austria peace no more
bastard o tremble for you hear the lion roar
king john up higher to the plain where we'll set forth
 in best appointment all our regiments
bastard speed then to take advantage of the field
king philip it shall be so and at the other hill
 command the rest to stand god and our right
 exeunt
 here after excursions enter the herald of france
 with trumpets to the gates
french herald you men of angiers open wide your gates
 and let young arthur duke of bretagne in
 who by the hand of france this day hath made
 much work for tears in many an english mother
 whose sons lie scattered on the bleeding ground
 many a widow's husband grovelling lies
 coldly embracing the discolour'd earth
 and victory with little loss doth play
 upon the dancing banners of the french
 who are at hand triumphantly display'd
 to enter conquerors and to proclaim
 arthur of bretagne england's king and yours
 enter english herald with trumpet
english herald rejoice you men of angiers ring your bells
 king john your king and england's doth approach
 commander of this hot malicious day
 their armours that march'd hence so silverbright
 hither return all gilt with frenchmen's blood
 there stuck no plume in any english crest
 that is removed by a staff of france
 our colours do return in those same hands
 that did display them when we first march'd forth
 and like a troop of jolly huntsmen come
 our lusty english all with purpled hands
 dyed in the dying slaughter of their foes
 open your gates and gives the victors way
first citizen heralds from off our towers we might behold
 from first to last the onset and retire
 of both your armies whose equality
 by our best eyes cannot be censured
 blood hath bought blood and blows have answered blows
 strength match'd with strength and power confronted power
 both are alike and both alike we like
 one must prove greatest while they weigh so even
 we hold our town for neither yet for both
 reenter king john and king philip with their
 powers severally
king john france hast thou yet more blood to cast away
 say shall the current of our right run on
 whose passage vex'd with thy impediment
 shall leave his native channel and o'erswell
 with course disturb'd even thy confining shores
 unless thou let his silver water keep
 a peaceful progress to the ocean
king philip england thou hast not saved one drop of blood
 in this hot trial more than we of france
 rather lost more and by this hand i swear
 that sways the earth this climate overlooks
 before we will lay down our justborne arms
 we'll put thee down gainst whom these arms we bear
 or add a royal number to the dead
 gracing the scroll that tells of this war's loss
 with slaughter coupled to the name of kings
bastard ha majesty how high thy glory towers
 when the rich blood of kings is set on fire
 o now doth death line his dead chaps with steel
 the swords of soldiers are his teeth his fangs
 and now he feasts mousing the flesh of men
 in undetermined differences of kings
 why stand these royal fronts amazed thus
 cry havoc kings back to the stained field
 you equal potents fiery kindled spirits
 then let confusion of one part confirm
 the other's peace till then blows blood and death
king john whose party do the townsmen yet admit
king philip speak citizens for england who's your king
first citizen the king of england when we know the king
king philip know him in us that here hold up his right
king john in us that are our own great deputy
 and bear possession of our person here
 lord of our presence angiers and of you
first citizen a greater power then we denies all this
 and till it be undoubted we do lock
 our former scruple in our strongbarr'd gates
 king'd of our fears until our fears resolved
 be by some certain king purged and deposed
bastard by heaven these scroyles of angiers flout you kings
 and stand securely on their battlements
 as in a theatre whence they gape and point
 at your industrious scenes and acts of death
 your royal presences be ruled by me
 do like the mutines of jerusalem
 be friends awhile and both conjointly bend
 your sharpest deeds of malice on this town
 by east and west let france and england mount
 their battering cannon charged to the mouths
 till their soulfearing clamours have brawl'd down
 the flinty ribs of this contemptuous city
 i'ld play incessantly upon these jades
 even till unfenced desolation
 leave them as naked as the vulgar air
 that done dissever your united strengths
 and part your mingled colours once again
 turn face to face and bloody point to point
 then in a moment fortune shall cull forth
 out of one side her happy minion
 to whom in favour she shall give the day
 and kiss him with a glorious victory
 how like you this wild counsel mighty states
 smacks it not something of the policy
king john now by the sky that hangs above our heads
 i like it well france shall we knit our powers
 and lay this angiers even to the ground
 then after fight who shall be king of it
bastard an if thou hast the mettle of a king
 being wronged as we are by this peevish town
 turn thou the mouth of thy artillery
 as we will ours against these saucy walls
 and when that we have dash'd them to the ground
 why then defy each other and pellmell
 make work upon ourselves for heaven or hell
king philip let it be so say where will you assault
king john we from the west will send destruction
 into this city's bosom
austria i from the north
king philip our thunder from the south
 shall rain their drift of bullets on this town
bastard o prudent discipline from north to south
 austria and france shoot in each other's mouth
 i'll stir them to it come away away
first citizen hear us great kings vouchsafe awhile to stay
 and i shall show you peace and fairfaced league
