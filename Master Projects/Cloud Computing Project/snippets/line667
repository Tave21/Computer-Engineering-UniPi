salisbury but william of hatfield died without an heir
york the third son duke of clarence from whose line
 i claimed the crown had issue philippe a daughter
 who married edmund mortimer earl of march
 edmund had issue roger earl of march
 roger had issue edmund anne and eleanor
salisbury this edmund in the reign of bolingbroke
 as i have read laid claim unto the crown
 and but for owen glendower had been king
 who kept him in captivity till he died
 but to the rest
york his eldest sister anne
 my mother being heir unto the crown
 married richard earl of cambridge who was son
 to edmund langley edward the third's fifth son
 by her i claim the kingdom she was heir
 to roger earl of march who was the son
 of edmund mortimer who married philippe
 sole daughter unto lionel duke of clarence
 so if the issue of the elder son
 succeed before the younger i am king
warwick what plain proceeding is more plain than this
 henry doth claim the crown from john of gaunt
 the fourth son york claims it from the third
 till lionel's issue fails his should not reign
 it fails not yet but flourishes in thee
 and in thy sons fair slips of such a stock
 then father salisbury kneel we together
 and in this private plot be we the first
 that shall salute our rightful sovereign
 with honour of his birthright to the crown
both long live our sovereign richard england's king
york we thank you lords but i am not your king
 till i be crown'd and that my sword be stain'd
 with heartblood of the house of lancaster
 and that's not suddenly to be perform'd
 but with advice and silent secrecy
 do you as i do in these dangerous days
 wink at the duke of suffolk's insolence
 at beaufort's pride at somerset's ambition
 at buckingham and all the crew of them
 till they have snared the shepherd of the flock
 that virtuous prince the good duke humphrey
 tis that they seek and they in seeking that
 shall find their deaths if york can prophesy
salisbury my lord break we off we know your mind at full
warwick my heart assures me that the earl of warwick
 shall one day make the duke of york a king
york and nevil this i do assure myself
 richard shall live to make the earl of warwick
 the greatest man in england but the king

 2 king henry vi
act ii
scene iv a street
 enter gloucester and his servingmen in
 mourning cloaks
gloucester thus sometimes hath the brightest day a cloud
 and after summer evermore succeeds
 barren winter with his wrathful nipping cold
 so cares and joys abound as seasons fleet
 sirs what's o'clock
servants ten my lord
gloucester ten is the hour that was appointed me
 to watch the coming of my punish'd duchess
 uneath may she endure the flinty streets
 to tread them with her tenderfeeling feet
 sweet nell ill can thy noble mind abrook
 the abject people gazing on thy face
 with envious looks laughing at thy shame
 that erst did follow thy proud chariotwheels
 when thou didst ride in triumph through the streets
 but soft i think she comes and i'll prepare
 my tearstain'd eyes to see her miseries
 enter the duchess in a white sheet and a taper
 burning in her hand with stanley the sheriff
 and officers
servant so please your grace we'll take her from the sheriff
gloucester no stir not for your lives let her pass by
duchess come you my lord to see my open shame
 now thou dost penance too look how they gaze
 see how the giddy multitude do point
