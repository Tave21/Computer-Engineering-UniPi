 and quench the guards of the everfixed pole
 i never did like molestation view
 on the enchafed flood
montano if that the turkish fleet
 be not enshelter'd and embay'd they are drown'd
 it is impossible they bear it out
 enter a third gentleman
third gentleman news lads our wars are done
 the desperate tempest hath so bang'd the turks
 that their designment halts a noble ship of venice
 hath seen a grievous wreck and sufferance
 on most part of their fleet
montano how is this true
third gentleman the ship is here put in
 a veronesa michael cassio
 lieutenant to the warlike moor othello
 is come on shore the moor himself at sea
 and is in full commission here for cyprus
montano i am glad on't tis a worthy governor
third gentleman but this same cassio though he speak of comfort
 touching the turkish loss yet he looks sadly
 and prays the moor be safe for they were parted
 with foul and violent tempest
montano pray heavens he be
 for i have served him and the man commands
 like a full soldier let's to the seaside ho
 as well to see the vessel that's come in
 as to throw out our eyes for brave othello
 even till we make the main and the aerial blue
 an indistinct regard
third gentleman come let's do so
 for every minute is expectancy
 of more arrivance
 enter cassio
cassio thanks you the valiant of this warlike isle
 that so approve the moor o let the heavens
 give him defence against the elements
 for i have lost us him on a dangerous sea
montano is he well shipp'd
cassio his bark is stoutly timber'd his pilot
 of very expert and approved allowance
 therefore my hopes not surfeited to death
 stand in bold cure
 a cry within a sail a sail a sail'
 enter a fourth gentleman
cassio what noise
fourth gentleman the town is empty on the brow o the sea
 stand ranks of people and they cry a sail'
cassio my hopes do shape him for the governor
 guns heard
second gentlemen they do discharge their shot of courtesy
 our friends at least
cassio i pray you sir go forth
 and give us truth who tis that is arrived
second gentleman i shall
 exit
montano but good lieutenant is your general wived
cassio most fortunately he hath achieved a maid
 that paragons description and wild fame
 one that excels the quirks of blazoning pens
 and in the essential vesture of creation
 does tire the ingener
 reenter second gentleman
 how now who has put in
second gentleman tis one iago ancient to the general
cassio has had most favourable and happy speed
 tempests themselves high seas and howling winds
 the gutter'd rocks and congregated sands
 traitors ensteep'd to clog the guiltless keel
 as having sense of beauty do omit
 their mortal natures letting go safely by
 the divine desdemona
montano what is she
cassio she that i spake of our great captain's captain
 left in the conduct of the bold iago
 whose footing here anticipates our thoughts
 a se'nnight's speed great jove othello guard
 and swell his sail with thine own powerful breath
 that he may bless this bay with his tall ship
 make love's quick pants in desdemona's arms
 give renew'd fire to our extincted spirits
 and bring all cyprus comfort
 enter desdemona emilia iago roderigo and
 attendants
 o behold
 the riches of the ship is come on shore
 ye men of cyprus let her have your knees
 hail to thee lady and the grace of heaven
 before behind thee and on every hand
 enwheel thee round
desdemona i thank you valiant cassio
 what tidings can you tell me of my lord
cassio he is not yet arrived nor know i aught
 but that he's well and will be shortly here
desdemona o but i fearhow lost you company
cassio the great contention of the sea and skies
 parted our fellowshipbut hark a sail
 within a sail a sail guns heard
second gentleman they give their greeting to the citadel
 this likewise is a friend
cassio see for the news
 exit gentleman
 good ancient you are welcome
 to emilia
 welcome mistress
 let it not gall your patience good iago
 that i extend my manners tis my breeding
 that gives me this bold show of courtesy
 kissing her
iago sir would she give you so much of her lips
 as of her tongue she oft bestows on me
 you'll have enough
desdemona alas she has no speech
iago in faith too much
 i find it still when i have list to sleep
 marry before your ladyship i grant
 she puts her tongue a little in her heart
 and chides with thinking
emilia you have little cause to say so
iago come on come on you are pictures out of doors
 bells in your parlors wildcats in your kitchens
 saints m your injuries devils being offended
 players in your housewifery and housewives in your beds
desdemona o fie upon thee slanderer
iago nay it is true or else i am a turk
 you rise to play and go to bed to work
emilia you shall not write my praise
iago no let me not
desdemona what wouldst thou write of me if thou shouldst
 praise me
iago o gentle lady do not put me to't
 for i am nothing if not critical
desdemona come on assay there's one gone to the harbour
iago ay madam
desdemona i am not merry but i do beguile
 the thing i am by seeming otherwise
 come how wouldst thou praise me
iago i am about it but indeed my invention
 comes from my pate as birdlime does from frize
 it plucks out brains and all but my muse labours
 and thus she is deliver'd
 if she be fair and wise fairness and wit
 the one's for use the other useth it
desdemona well praised how if she be black and witty
iago if she be black and thereto have a wit
 she'll find a white that shall her blackness fit
desdemona worse and worse
emilia how if fair and foolish
iago she never yet was foolish that was fair
 for even her folly help'd her to an heir
desdemona these are old fond paradoxes to make fools laugh i'
 the alehouse what miserable praise hast thou for
 her that's foul and foolish
iago there's none so foul and foolish thereunto
 but does foul pranks which fair and wise ones do
desdemona o heavy ignorance thou praisest the worst best
 but what praise couldst thou bestow on a deserving
 woman indeed one that in the authority of her
 merit did justly put on the vouch of very malice itself
iago she that was ever fair and never proud
 had tongue at will and yet was never loud
 never lack'd gold and yet went never gay
 fled from her wish and yet said now i may'
 she that being anger'd her revenge being nigh
 bade her wrong stay and her displeasure fly
 she that in wisdom never was so frail
 to change the cod's head for the salmon's tail
 she that could think and ne'er disclose her mind
 see suitors following and not look behind
 she was a wight if ever such wight were
desdemona to do what
iago to suckle fools and chronicle small beer
desdemona o most lame and impotent conclusion do not learn
 of him emilia though he be thy husband how say
 you cassio is he not a most profane and liberal
 counsellor
cassio he speaks home madam you may relish him more in
 the soldier than in the scholar
iago aside he takes her by the palm ay well said
 whisper with as little a web as this will i
 ensnare as great a fly as cassio ay smile upon
 her do i will gyve thee in thine own courtship
 you say true tis so indeed if such tricks as
 these strip you out of your lieutenantry it had
 been better you had not kissed your three fingers so
 oft which now again you are most apt to play the
 sir in very good well kissed an excellent
 courtesy tis so indeed yet again your fingers
 to your lips would they were clysterpipes for your sake
 trumpet within
 the moor i know his trumpet
cassio tis truly so
desdemona let's meet him and receive him
cassio lo where he comes
 enter othello and attendants
othello o my fair warrior
desdemona my dear othello
othello it gives me wonder great as my content
 to see you here before me o my soul's joy
 if after every tempest come such calms
