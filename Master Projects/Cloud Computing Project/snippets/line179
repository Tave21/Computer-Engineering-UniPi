 thou madst thine enemies shake as if the world
 were feverous and did tremble
 reenter marcius bleeding assaulted by the enemy
first soldier look sir
lartius o'tis marcius
 let's fetch him off or make remain alike
 they fight and all enter the city

act i
scene v corioli a street
 enter certain romans with spoils
first roman this will i carry to rome
second roman and i this
third roman a murrain on't i took this for silver
 alarum continues still afar off
 enter marcius and titus lartius with a trumpet
marcius see here these movers that do prize their hours
 at a crack'd drachm cushions leaden spoons
 irons of a doit doublets that hangmen would
 bury with those that wore them these base slaves
 ere yet the fight be done pack up down with them
 and hark what noise the general makes to him
 there is the man of my soul's hate aufidius
 piercing our romans then valiant titus take
 convenient numbers to make good the city
 whilst i with those that have the spirit will haste
 to help cominius
lartius worthy sir thou bleed'st
 thy exercise hath been too violent for
 a second course of fight
marcius sir praise me not
 my work hath yet not warm'd me fare you well
 the blood i drop is rather physical
 than dangerous to me to aufidius thus
 i will appear and fight
lartius now the fair goddess fortune
 fall deep in love with thee and her great charms
 misguide thy opposers swords bold gentleman
 prosperity be thy page
marcius thy friend no less
 than those she placeth highest so farewell
lartius thou worthiest marcius
 exit marcius
 go sound thy trumpet in the marketplace
 call thither all the officers o the town
 where they shall know our mind away

 coriolanus
act i
scene vi near the camp of cominius
 enter cominius as it were in retire
 with soldiers
cominius breathe you my friends well fought
 we are come off
 like romans neither foolish in our stands
 nor cowardly in retire believe me sirs
 we shall be charged again whiles we have struck
 by interims and conveying gusts we have heard
 the charges of our friends ye roman gods
 lead their successes as we wish our own
 that both our powers with smiling
 fronts encountering
 may give you thankful sacrifice
 enter a messenger
 thy news
messenger the citizens of corioli have issued
 and given to lartius and to marcius battle
 i saw our party to their trenches driven
 and then i came away
cominius though thou speak'st truth
 methinks thou speak'st not well
 how long is't since
messenger above an hour my lord
cominius tis not a mile briefly we heard their drums
 how couldst thou in a mile confound an hour
 and bring thy news so late
messenger spies of the volsces
 held me in chase that i was forced to wheel
 three or four miles about else had i sir
 half an hour since brought my report
cominius who's yonder
 that does appear as he were flay'd o gods
 he has the stamp of marcius and i have
 beforetime seen him thus
marcius within come i too late
cominius the shepherd knows not thunder from a tabour
 more than i know the sound of marcius tongue
 from every meaner man
 enter marcius
marcius come i too late
cominius ay if you come not in the blood of others
 but mantled in your own
marcius o let me clip ye
 in arms as sound as when i woo'd in heart
 as merry as when our nuptial day was done
 and tapers burn'd to bedward
cominius flower of warriors
 how is it with titus lartius
marcius as with a man busied about decrees
 condemning some to death and some to exile
 ransoming him or pitying threatening the other
 holding corioli in the name of rome
 even like a fawning greyhound in the leash
 to let him slip at will
cominius where is that slave
 which told me they had beat you to your trenches
 where is he call him hither
marcius let him alone
 he did inform the truth but for our gentlemen
 the common filea plague tribunes for them
 the mouse ne'er shunn'd the cat as they did budge
 from rascals worse than they
cominius but how prevail'd you
marcius will the time serve to tell i do not think
 where is the enemy are you lords o the field
 if not why cease you till you are so
cominius marcius
 we have at disadvantage fought and did
 retire to win our purpose
marcius how lies their battle know you on which side
 they have placed their men of trust
cominius as i guess marcius
 their bands i the vaward are the antiates
 of their best trust o'er them aufidius
 their very heart of hope
marcius i do beseech you
 by all the battles wherein we have fought
 by the blood we have shed together by the vows
 we have made to endure friends that you directly
 set me against aufidius and his antiates
 and that you not delay the present but
 filling the air with swords advanced and darts
 we prove this very hour
cominius though i could wish
 you were conducted to a gentle bath
 and balms applied to you yet dare i never
 deny your asking take your choice of those
 that best can aid your action
marcius those are they
 that most are willing if any such be here
 as it were sin to doubtthat love this painting
 wherein you see me smear'd if any fear
 lesser his person than an ill report
 if any think brave death outweighs bad life
 and that his country's dearer than himself
 let him alone or so many so minded
 wave thus to express his disposition
 and follow marcius
 they all shout and wave their swords take him up in
 their arms and cast up their caps
 o me alone make you a sword of me
 if these shows be not outward which of you
 but is four volsces none of you but is
 able to bear against the great aufidius
 a shield as hard as his a certain number
 though thanks to all must i select
 from all the rest
 shall bear the business in some other fight
 as cause will be obey'd please you to march
 and four shall quickly draw out my command
 which men are best inclined
cominius march on my fellows
 make good this ostentation and you shall
 divide in all with us

 titus lartius having set a guard upon
 corioli going with drum and trumpet toward
 cominius and caius marcius enters with
 lieutenant other soldiers and a scout
lartius so let the ports be guarded keep your duties
 as i have set them down if i do send dispatch
 those centuries to our aid the rest will serve
 for a short holding if we lose the field
 we cannot keep the town
lieutenant fear not our care sir
lartius hence and shut your gates upon's
 our guider come to the roman camp conduct us

scene viii a field of battle
 alarum as in battle enter from opposite sides
 marcius and aufidius
marcius i'll fight with none but thee for i do hate thee
 worse than a promisebreaker
aufidius we hate alike
 not afric owns a serpent i abhor
 more than thy fame and envy fix thy foot
marcius let the first budger die the other's slave
 and the gods doom him after
aufidius if i fly marcius
 holloa me like a hare
marcius within these three hours tullus
 alone i fought in your corioli walls
 and made what work i pleased tis not my blood
 wherein thou seest me mask'd for thy revenge
 wrench up thy power to the highest
