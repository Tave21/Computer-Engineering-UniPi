 my brother might not claim him nor your father
 being none of his refuse him this concludes
 my mother's son did get your father's heir
 your father's heir must have your father's land
robert shall then my father's will be of no force
 to dispossess that child which is not his
bastard of no more force to dispossess me sir
 than was his will to get me as i think
queen elinor whether hadst thou rather be a faulconbridge
 and like thy brother to enjoy thy land
 or the reputed son of coeurdelion
 lord of thy presence and no land beside
bastard madam an if my brother had my shape
 and i had his sir robert's his like him
 and if my legs were two such ridingrods
 my arms such eelskins stuff'd my face so thin
 that in mine ear i durst not stick a rose
 lest men should say look where threefarthings goes'
 and to his shape were heir to all this land
 would i might never stir from off this place
 i would give it every foot to have this face
 i would not be sir nob in any case
queen elinor i like thee well wilt thou forsake thy fortune
 bequeath thy land to him and follow me
 i am a soldier and now bound to france
bastard brother take you my land i'll take my chance
 your face hath got five hundred pound a year
 yet sell your face for five pence and tis dear
 madam i'll follow you unto the death
queen elinor nay i would have you go before me thither
bastard our country manners give our betters way
king john what is thy name
bastard philip my liege so is my name begun
 philip good old sir robert's wife's eldest son
king john from henceforth bear his name whose form thou bear'st
 kneel thou down philip but rise more great
 arise sir richard and plantagenet
bastard brother by the mother's side give me your hand
 my father gave me honour yours gave land
 now blessed by the hour by night or day
 when i was got sir robert was away
queen elinor the very spirit of plantagenet
 i am thy grandam richard call me so
bastard madam by chance but not by truth what though
 something about a little from the right
 in at the window or else o'er the hatch
 who dares not stir by day must walk by night
 and have is have however men do catch
 near or far off well won is still well shot
 and i am i howe'er i was begot
king john go faulconbridge now hast thou thy desire
 a landless knight makes thee a landed squire
 come madam and come richard we must speed
 for france for france for it is more than need
bastard brother adieu good fortune come to thee
 for thou wast got i the way of honesty
 exeunt all but bastard
 a foot of honour better than i was
 but many a many foot of land the worse
 well now can i make any joan a lady
 good den sir richard''godamercy fellow'
 and if his name be george i'll call him peter
 for newmade honour doth forget men's names
 tis too respective and too sociable
 for your conversion now your traveller
 he and his toothpick at my worship's mess
 and when my knightly stomach is sufficed
 why then i suck my teeth and catechise
 my picked man of countries my dear sir'
 thus leaning on mine elbow i begin
 i shall beseech you'that is question now
 and then comes answer like an absey book
 o sir says answer at your best command
 at your employment at your service sir'
 no sir says question i sweet sir at yours'
 and so ere answer knows what question would
 saving in dialogue of compliment
 and talking of the alps and apennines
 the pyrenean and the river po
 it draws toward supper in conclusion so
 but this is worshipful society
 and fits the mounting spirit like myself
 for he is but a bastard to the time
 that doth not smack of observation
 and so am i whether i smack or no
 and not alone in habit and device
 exterior form outward accoutrement
 but from the inward motion to deliver
 sweet sweet sweet poison for the age's tooth
 which though i will not practise to deceive
 yet to avoid deceit i mean to learn
 for it shall strew the footsteps of my rising
 but who comes in such haste in ridingrobes
 what womanpost is this hath she no husband
 that will take pains to blow a horn before her
 enter lady faulconbridge and gurney
 o me it is my mother how now good lady
 what brings you here to court so hastily
lady faulconbridge where is that slave thy brother where is he
 that holds in chase mine honour up and down
bastard my brother robert old sir robert's son
 colbrand the giant that same mighty man
 is it sir robert's son that you seek so
lady faulconbridge sir robert's son ay thou unreverend boy
 sir robert's son why scorn'st thou at sir robert

bastard james gurney wilt thou give us leave awhile
gurney good leave good philip
bastard philip sparrow james

 exit gurney
 madam i was not old sir robert's son
 sir robert might have eat his part in me
 upon goodfriday and ne'er broke his fast
 sir robert could do well marry to confess
 could he get me sir robert could not do it
 we know his handiwork therefore good mother
 to whom am i beholding for these limbs
 sir robert never holp to make this leg
lady faulconbridge hast thou conspired with thy brother too
 that for thine own gain shouldst defend mine honour
 what means this scorn thou most untoward knave
bastard knight knight good mother basiliscolike
 what i am dubb'd i have it on my shoulder
 but mother i am not sir robert's son
 i have disclaim'd sir robert and my land
 legitimation name and all is gone
 then good my mother let me know my father
 some proper man i hope who was it mother
lady faulconbridge hast thou denied thyself a faulconbridge
bastard as faithfully as i deny the devil
lady faulconbridge king richard coeurdelion was thy father
 by long and vehement suit i was seduced
 to make room for him in my husband's bed
 heaven lay not my transgression to my charge
 thou art the issue of my dear offence
 which was so strongly urged past my defence
bastard now by this light were i to get again
 madam i would not wish a better father
 some sins do bear their privilege on earth
 and so doth yours your fault was not your folly
 needs must you lay your heart at his dispose
 subjected tribute to commanding love
 against whose fury and unmatched force
 the aweless lion could not wage the fight
 nor keep his princely heart from richard's hand
 he that perforce robs lions of their hearts
 may easily win a woman's ay my mother
 with all my heart i thank thee for my father
 who lives and dares but say thou didst not well
 when i was got i'll send his soul to hell
 come lady i will show thee to my kin
 and they shall say when richard me begot
 if thou hadst said him nay it had been sin
 who says it was he lies i say twas not

act ii
scene i france before angiers
 enter austria and forces drums etc on one side
 on the other king philip and his power lewis
 arthur constance and attendants
lewis before angiers well met brave austria
 arthur that great forerunner of thy blood
 richard that robb'd the lion of his heart
 and fought the holy wars in palestine
 by this brave duke came early to his grave
 and for amends to his posterity
 at our importance hither is he come
 to spread his colours boy in thy behalf
 and to rebuke the usurpation
 of thy unnatural uncle english john
 embrace him love him give him welcome hither
arthur god shall forgive you coeurdelion's death
 the rather that you give his offspring life
 shadowing their right under your wings of war
 i give you welcome with a powerless hand
 but with a heart full of unstained love
 welcome before the gates of angiers duke
lewis a noble boy who would not do thee right
austria upon thy cheek lay i this zealous kiss
 as seal to this indenture of my love
 that to my home i will no more return
 till angiers and the right thou hast in france
 together with that pale that whitefaced shore
 whose foot spurns back the ocean's roaring tides
 and coops from other lands her islanders
 even till that england hedged in with the main
 that waterwalled bulwark still secure
 and confident from foreign purposes
 even till that utmost corner of the west
 salute thee for her king till then fair boy
 will i not think of home but follow arms
constance o take his mother's thanks a widow's thanks
 till your strong hand shall help to give him strength
 to make a more requital to your love
austria the peace of heaven is theirs that lift their swords
 in such a just and charitable war
king philip well then to work our cannon shall be bent
 against the brows of this resisting town
