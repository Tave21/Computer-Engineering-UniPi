valentine if the duke continue these favours towards you
 cesario you are like to be much advanced he hath
 known you but three days and already you are no stranger

 you call in question the continuance of his love

 therefore good youth address thy gait unto her
 be not denied access stand at her doors
 and tell them there thy fixed foot shall grow
 till thou have audience
viola sure my noble lord
 if she be so abandon'd to her sorrow
 as it is spoke she never will admit me
duke orsino be clamorous and leap all civil bounds
 rather than make unprofited return
viola say i do speak with her my lord what then
duke orsino o then unfold the passion of my love
 surprise her with discourse of my dear faith
 it shall become thee well to act my woes

 for they shall yet belie thy happy years
 that say thou art a man diana's lip
 is not more smooth and rubious thy small pipe
 is as the maiden's organ shrill and sound

 when least in company prosper well in this
 and thou shalt live as freely as thy lord
 to call his fortunes thine

 saying was born of i fear no colours'
clown where good mistress mary
maria in the wars and that may you be bold to say in your foolery
clown well god give them wisdom that have it and those
 that are fools let them use their talents
maria yet you will be hanged for being so long absent or
 to be turned away is not that as good as a hanging to you
clown many a good hanging prevents a bad marriage and
 for turning away let summer bear it out
maria you are resolute then
clown not so neither but i am resolved on two points
maria that if one break the other will hold or if both
 break your gaskins fall
clown apt in good faith very apt well go thy way if
