 storm still enter kent and a gentleman meeting
kent who's there besides foul weather
gentleman one minded like the weather most unquietly
kent i know you where's the king
gentleman contending with the fretful element
 bids the winds blow the earth into the sea
 or swell the curled water bove the main
 that things might change or cease tears his white hair
 which the impetuous blasts with eyeless rage
 catch in their fury and make nothing of
 strives in his little world of man to outscorn
 the toandfroconflicting wind and rain
 this night wherein the cubdrawn bear would couch
 the lion and the bellypinched wolf
 keep their fur dry unbonneted he runs
 and bids what will take all
kent but who is with him
gentleman none but the fool who labours to outjest
 his heartstruck injuries
kent sir i do know you
 and dare upon the warrant of my note
 commend a dear thing to you there is division
 although as yet the face of it be cover'd
 with mutual cunning twixt albany and cornwall
 who haveas who have not that their great stars
 throned and set highservants who seem no less
 which are to france the spies and speculations
 intelligent of our state what hath been seen
 either in snuffs and packings of the dukes
 or the hard rein which both of them have borne
 against the old kind king or something deeper
 whereof perchance these are but furnishings
 but true it is from france there comes a power
 into this scatter'd kingdom who already
 wise in our negligence have secret feet
 in some of our best ports and are at point
 to show their open banner now to you
 if on my credit you dare build so far
 to make your speed to dover you shall find
 some that will thank you making just report
 of how unnatural and bemadding sorrow
 the king hath cause to plain
 i am a gentleman of blood and breeding
 and from some knowledge and assurance offer
 this office to you

 than my outwall open this purse and take
 what it contains if you shall see cordelia
 as fear not but you shallshow her this ring
 and she will tell you who your fellow is
 that yet you do not know fie on this storm
 i will go seek the king
gentleman give me your hand have you no more to say
kent few words but to effect more than all yet

 but yet i call you servile ministers
 that have with two pernicious daughters join'd
 your high engender'd battles gainst a head
 so old and white as this o o tis foul
fool he that has a house to put's head in has a good
 headpiece
 the codpiece that will house
 before the head has any
 the head and he shall louse
 so beggars marry many
 the man that makes his toe
 what he his heart should make
 shall of a corn cry woe
 and turn his sleep to wake
 for there was never yet fair woman but she made
 mouths in a glass
king lear no i will be the pattern of all patience
 i will say nothing

kent who's there
fool marry here's grace and a codpiece that's a wise
 man and a fool
kent alas sir are you here things that love night
 love not such nights as these the wrathful skies
 gallow the very wanderers of the dark
 and make them keep their caves since i was man
 such sheets of fire such bursts of horrid thunder
 such groans of roaring wind and rain i never
 remember to have heard man's nature cannot carry
 the affliction nor the fear
king lear let the great gods
 that keep this dreadful pother o'er our heads
 find out their enemies now tremble thou wretch
 that hast within thee undivulged crimes
 unwhipp'd of justice hide thee thou bloody hand
 thou perjured and thou simular man of virtue
 that art incestuous caitiff to pieces shake
 that under covert and convenient seeming
 hast practised on man's life close pentup guilts
 rive your concealing continents and cry
 these dreadful summoners grace i am a man
 more sinn'd against than sinning
kent alack bareheaded
 gracious my lord hard by here is a hovel
 some friendship will it lend you gainst the tempest
 repose you there while i to this hard house
 more harder than the stones whereof tis raised
 which even but now demanding after you
 denied me to come inreturn and force
 their scanted courtesy

 the art of our necessities is strange
 that can make vile things precious come
 your hovel
 poor fool and knave i have one part in my heart

 with hey ho the wind and the rain
 must make content with his fortunes fit
 for the rain it raineth every day
king lear true my good boy come bring us to this hovel
 exeunt king lear and kent
fool this is a brave night to cool a courtezan
 i'll speak a prophecy ere i go
 when priests are more in word than matter
 when brewers mar their malt with water
 when nobles are their tailors tutors
 no heretics burn'd but wenches suitors
 when every case in law is right
 no squire in debt nor no poor knight
 when slanders do not live in tongues
 nor cutpurses come not to throngs
 when usurers tell their gold i the field
 and bawds and whores do churches build
 then shall the realm of albion
 come to great confusion
 then comes the time who lives to see't
 that going shall be used with feet
 this prophecy merlin shall make for i live before his time
