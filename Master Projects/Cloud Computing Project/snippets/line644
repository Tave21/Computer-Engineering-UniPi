scene england
 2 king henry iv
 induction
 warkworth before the castle
 enter rumour painted full of tongues
rumour open your ears for which of you will stop
 the vent of hearing when loud rumour speaks
 i from the orient to the drooping west
 making the wind my posthorse still unfold
 the acts commenced on this ball of earth
 upon my tongues continual slanders ride
 the which in every language i pronounce
 stuffing the ears of men with false reports
 i speak of peace while covert enmity
 under the smile of safety wounds the world
 and who but rumour who but only i
 make fearful musters and prepared defence
 whiles the big year swoln with some other grief
 is thought with child by the stern tyrant war
 and no such matter rumour is a pipe
 blown by surmises jealousies conjectures
 and of so easy and so plain a stop
 that the blunt monster with uncounted heads
 the stilldiscordant wavering multitude
 can play upon it but what need i thus
 my wellknown body to anatomize
 among my household why is rumour here
 i run before king harry's victory
 who in a bloody field by shrewsbury
 hath beaten down young hotspur and his troops
 quenching the flame of bold rebellion
 even with the rebel's blood but what mean i
 to speak so true at first my office is
 to noise abroad that harry monmouth fell
 under the wrath of noble hotspur's sword
 and that the king before the douglas rage
 stoop'd his anointed head as low as death
 this have i rumour'd through the peasant towns
 between that royal field of shrewsbury
 and this wormeaten hold of ragged stone
 where hotspur's father old northumberland
 lies craftysick the posts come tiring on
 and not a man of them brings other news
 than they have learn'd of me from rumour's tongues
 they bring smooth comforts false worse than
 true wrongs

 2 king henry iv
act i
scene i the same
 enter lord bardolph
lord bardolph who keeps the gate here ho
 the porter opens the gate
 where is the earl
porter what shall i say you are
lord bardolph tell thou the earl
 that the lord bardolph doth attend him here
porter his lordship is walk'd forth into the orchard
 please it your honour knock but at the gate
 and he himself wilt answer
 enter northumberland
lord bardolph here comes the earl
 exit porter
northumberland what news lord bardolph every minute now
 should be the father of some stratagem
 the times are wild contention like a horse
 full of high feeding madly hath broke loose
 and bears down all before him
lord bardolph noble earl
 i bring you certain news from shrewsbury
northumberland good an god will
lord bardolph as good as heart can wish
 the king is almost wounded to the death
 and in the fortune of my lord your son
 prince harry slain outright and both the blunts
 kill'd by the hand of douglas young prince john
 and westmoreland and stafford fled the field
 and harry monmouth's brawn the hulk sir john
 is prisoner to your son o such a day
 so fought so follow'd and so fairly won
 came not till now to dignify the times
 since caesar's fortunes
northumberland how is this derived
 saw you the field came you from shrewsbury
lord bardolph i spake with one my lord that came from thence
 a gentleman well bred and of good name
 that freely render'd me these news for true
northumberland here comes my servant travers whom i sent
 on tuesday last to listen after news
 enter travers
lord bardolph my lord i overrode him on the way
 and he is furnish'd with no certainties
 more than he haply may retail from me
northumberland now travers what good tidings comes with you
travers my lord sir john umfrevile turn'd me back
 with joyful tidings and being better horsed
 outrode me after him came spurring hard
 a gentleman almost forspent with speed
 that stopp'd by me to breathe his bloodied horse
 he ask'd the way to chester and of him
 i did demand what news from shrewsbury
 he told me that rebellion had bad luck
 and that young harry percy's spur was cold
 with that he gave his able horse the head
 and bending forward struck his armed heels
 against the panting sides of his poor jade
 up to the rowelhead and starting so
 he seem'd in running to devour the way
 staying no longer question
northumberland ha again
 said he young harry percy's spur was cold
 of hotspur coldspur that rebellion
 had met ill luck
lord bardolph my lord i'll tell you what
 if my young lord your son have not the day
 upon mine honour for a silken point
 i'll give my barony never talk of it
northumberland why should that gentleman that rode by travers
 give then such instances of loss
lord bardolph who he
 he was some hilding fellow that had stolen
 the horse he rode on and upon my life
 spoke at a venture look here comes more news
 enter morton
northumberland yea this man's brow like to a titleleaf
 foretells the nature of a tragic volume
 so looks the strand whereon the imperious flood
 hath left a witness'd usurpation
 say morton didst thou come from shrewsbury
morton i ran from shrewsbury my noble lord
 where hateful death put on his ugliest mask
 to fright our party
northumberland how doth my son and brother
 thou tremblest and the whiteness in thy cheek
 is apter than thy tongue to tell thy errand
 even such a man so faint so spiritless
 so dull so dead in look so woebegone
 drew priam's curtain in the dead of night
 and would have told him half his troy was burnt
 but priam found the fire ere he his tongue
 and i my percy's death ere thou report'st it
 this thou wouldst say your son did thus and thus
 your brother thus so fought the noble douglas'
 stopping my greedy ear with their bold deeds
 but in the end to stop my ear indeed
 thou hast a sigh to blow away this praise
 ending with brother son and all are dead'
morton douglas is living and your brother yet
 but for my lord your son
northumberland why he is dead
 see what a ready tongue suspicion hath
 he that but fears the thing he would not know
 hath by instinct knowledge from others eyes
 that what he fear'd is chanced yet speak morton
 tell thou an earl his divination lies
 and i will take it as a sweet disgrace
 and make thee rich for doing me such wrong
morton you are too great to be by me gainsaid
 your spirit is too true your fears too certain
northumberland yet for all this say not that percy's dead
 i see a strange confession in thine eye
 thou shakest thy head and hold'st it fear or sin
 to speak a truth if he be slain say so
 the tongue offends not that reports his death
 and he doth sin that doth belie the dead
 not he which says the dead is not alive
 yet the first bringer of unwelcome news
