richard now clifford i have singled thee alone
 suppose this arm is for the duke of york
 and this for rutland both bound to revenge
 wert thou environ'd with a brazen wall
clifford now richard i am with thee here alone
 this is the hand that stabb'd thy father york
 and this the hand that slew thy brother rutland
 and here's the heart that triumphs in their death
 and cheers these hands that slew thy sire and brother
 to execute the like upon thyself
 and so have at thee
 they fight warwick comes clifford flies
richard nay warwick single out some other chase
 for i myself will hunt this wolf to death

 3 king henry vi
act ii
scene v another part of the field
 alarum enter king henry vi alone
king henry vi this battle fares like to the morning's war
 when dying clouds contend with growing light
 what time the shepherd blowing of his nails
 can neither call it perfect day nor night
 now sways it this way like a mighty sea
 forced by the tide to combat with the wind
 now sways it that way like the selfsame sea
 forced to retire by fury of the wind
 sometime the flood prevails and then the wind
 now one the better then another best
 both tugging to be victors breast to breast
 yet neither conqueror nor conquered
 so is the equal of this fell war
 here on this molehill will i sit me down
 to whom god will there be the victory
 for margaret my queen and clifford too
 have chid me from the battle swearing both
 they prosper best of all when i am thence
 would i were dead if god's good will were so
 for what is in this world but grief and woe
 o god methinks it were a happy life
 to be no better than a homely swain
 to sit upon a hill as i do now
 to carve out dials quaintly point by point
 thereby to see the minutes how they run
 how many make the hour full complete
 how many hours bring about the day
 how many days will finish up the year
 how many years a mortal man may live
 when this is known then to divide the times
 so many hours must i tend my flock
 so many hours must i take my rest
 so many hours must i contemplate
 so many hours must i sport myself
 so many days my ewes have been with young
 so many weeks ere the poor fools will ean
 so many years ere i shall shear the fleece
 so minutes hours days months and years
 pass'd over to the end they were created
 would bring white hairs unto a quiet grave
 ah what a life were this how sweet how lovely
 gives not the hawthornbush a sweeter shade
 to shepherds looking on their silly sheep
 than doth a rich embroider'd canopy
 to kings that fear their subjects treachery
 o yes it doth a thousandfold it doth
 and to conclude the shepherd's homely curds
 his cold thin drink out of his leather bottle
 his wonted sleep under a fresh tree's shade
 all which secure and sweetly he enjoys
 is far beyond a prince's delicates
 his viands sparkling in a golden cup
 his body couched in a curious bed
 when care mistrust and treason waits on him
 alarum enter a son that has killed his father
 dragging in the dead body
son ill blows the wind that profits nobody
 this man whom hand to hand i slew in fight
 may be possessed with some store of crowns
 and i that haply take them from him now
 may yet ere night yield both my life and them
 to some man else as this dead man doth me
 who's this o god it is my father's face
 whom in this conflict i unwares have kill'd
 o heavy times begetting such events
 from london by the king was i press'd forth
 my father being the earl of warwick's man
 came on the part of york press'd by his master
 and i who at his hands received my life him
 have by my hands of life bereaved him
 pardon me god i knew not what i did
 and pardon father for i knew not thee
 my tears shall wipe away these bloody marks
 and no more words till they have flow'd their fill
king henry vi o piteous spectacle o bloody times
 whiles lions war and battle for their dens
 poor harmless lambs abide their enmity
 weep wretched man i'll aid thee tear for tear
 and let our hearts and eyes like civil war
 be blind with tears and break o'ercharged with grief
 enter a father that has killed his son bringing in the body
father thou that so stoutly hast resisted me
 give me thy gold if thou hast any gold
 for i have bought it with an hundred blows
 but let me see is this our foeman's face
 ah no no no it is mine only son
 ah boy if any life be left in thee
 throw up thine eye see see what showers arise
 blown with the windy tempest of my heart
 upon thy words that kill mine eye and heart
 o pity god this miserable age
 what stratagems how fell how butcherly
 erroneous mutinous and unnatural
 this deadly quarrel daily doth beget
 o boy thy father gave thee life too soon
 and hath bereft thee of thy life too late
king henry vi woe above woe grief more than common grief
 o that my death would stay these ruthful deeds
 o pity pity gentle heaven pity
 the red rose and the white are on his face
 the fatal colours of our striving houses
 the one his purple blood right well resembles
 the other his pale cheeks methinks presenteth
 wither one rose and let the other flourish
 if you contend a thousand lives must wither
son how will my mother for a father's death
 take on with me and ne'er be satisfied
father how will my wife for slaughter of my son
 shed seas of tears and ne'er be satisfied
king henry vi how will the country for these woful chances
 misthink the king and not be satisfied
son was ever son so rued a father's death
father was ever father so bemoan'd his son
king henry vi was ever king so grieved for subjects woe
 much is your sorrow mine ten times so much
son i'll bear thee hence where i may weep my fill
 exit with the body
father these arms of mine shall be thy windingsheet
 my heart sweet boy shall be thy sepulchre
 for from my heart thine image ne'er shall go
 my sighing breast shall be thy funeral bell
 and so obsequious will thy father be
 even for the loss of thee having no more
 as priam was for all his valiant sons
 i'll bear thee hence and let them fight that will
 for i have murdered where i should not kill
 exit with the body
king henry vi sadhearted men much overgone with care
 here sits a king more woful than you are
 alarums excursions enter queen margaret prince
 edward and exeter
prince edward fly father fly for all your friends are fled
 and warwick rages like a chafed bull
 away for death doth hold us in pursuit
queen margaret mount you my lord towards berwick post amain
 edward and richard like a brace of greyhounds
 having the fearful flying hare in sight
 with fiery eyes sparkling for very wrath
 and bloody steel grasp'd in their ireful hands
 are at our backs and therefore hence amain
exeter away for vengeance comes along with them
 nay stay not to expostulate make speed
 or else come after i'll away before
king henry vi nay take me with thee good sweet exeter
 not that i fear to stay but love to go
 whither the queen intends forward away
 exeunt
 3 king henry vi
act ii
scene vi another part of the field
 a loud alarum enter clifford wounded
clifford here burns my candle out ay here it dies
 which whiles it lasted gave king henry light
 o lancaster i fear thy overthrow
 more than my body's parting with my soul
 my love and fear glued many friends to thee
 and now i fall thy tough commixture melts
 impairing henry strengthening misproud york
 the common people swarm like summer flies
 and whither fly the gnats but to the sun
 and who shines now but henry's enemies
 o phoebus hadst thou never given consent
 that phaethon should cheque thy fiery steeds
 thy burning car never had scorch'd the earth
 and henry hadst thou sway'd as kings should do
 or as thy father and his father did
 giving no ground unto the house of york
 they never then had sprung like summer flies
 i and ten thousand in this luckless realm
 had left no mourning widows for our death
 and thou this day hadst kept thy chair in peace
 for what doth cherish weeds but gentle air
 and what makes robbers bold but too much lenity
 bootless are plaints and cureless are my wounds
 no way to fly nor strength to hold out flight
 the foe is merciless and will not pity
 for at their hands i have deserved no pity
 the air hath got into my deadly wounds
 and much effuse of blood doth make me faint
 come york and richard warwick and the rest
 i stabb'd your fathers bosoms split my breast
