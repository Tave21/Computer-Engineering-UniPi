 come trusty sword
 come blade my breast imbrue
 stabs herself
 and farewell friends
 thus thisby ends
 adieu adieu adieu
 dies
theseus moonshine and lion are left to bury the dead
demetrius ay and wall too
bottom starting up no assure you the wall is down that
 parted their fathers will it please you to see the
 epilogue or to hear a bergomask dance between two
 of our company
theseus no epilogue i pray you for your play needs no
 excuse never excuse for when the players are all
 dead there needs none to be blamed marry if he
 that writ it had played pyramus and hanged himself
 in thisbe's garter it would have been a fine
 tragedy and so it is truly and very notably
 discharged but come your bergomask let your
 epilogue alone
 a dance
 the iron tongue of midnight hath told twelve
 lovers to bed tis almost fairy time
 i fear we shall outsleep the coming morn
 as much as we this night have overwatch'd
 this palpablegross play hath well beguiled
 the heavy gait of night sweet friends to bed
 a fortnight hold we this solemnity
 in nightly revels and new jollity
 exeunt
 enter puck
puck now the hungry lion roars
 and the wolf behowls the moon
 whilst the heavy ploughman snores
 all with weary task fordone
 now the wasted brands do glow
 whilst the screechowl screeching loud
 puts the wretch that lies in woe
 in remembrance of a shroud
 now it is the time of night
 that the graves all gaping wide
 every one lets forth his sprite
 in the churchway paths to glide
 and we fairies that do run
 by the triple hecate's team
 from the presence of the sun
 following darkness like a dream
 now are frolic not a mouse
 shall disturb this hallow'd house
 i am sent with broom before
 to sweep the dust behind the door
 enter oberon and titania with their train
oberon through the house give gathering light
 by the dead and drowsy fire
 every elf and fairy sprite
 hop as light as bird from brier
 and this ditty after me
 sing and dance it trippingly
titania first rehearse your song by rote
 to each word a warbling note
 hand in hand with fairy grace
 will we sing and bless this place
 song and dance
oberon now until the break of day
 through this house each fairy stray
 to the best bridebed will we
 which by us shall blessed be
 and the issue there create
 ever shall be fortunate
 so shall all the couples three
 ever true in loving be
 and the blots of nature's hand
 shall not in their issue stand
 never mole hare lip nor scar
 nor mark prodigious such as are
 despised in nativity
 shall upon their children be
 with this fielddew consecrate
 every fairy take his gait
 and each several chamber bless
 through this palace with sweet peace
 and the owner of it blest
 ever shall in safety rest
 trip away make no stay
 meet me all by break of day
 exeunt oberon titania and train
puck if we shadows have offended
 think but this and all is mended
 that you have but slumber'd here
 while these visions did appear
 and this weak and idle theme
 no more yielding but a dream
 gentles do not reprehend
 if you pardon we will mend
 and as i am an honest puck
 if we have unearned luck
 now to scape the serpent's tongue
 we will make amends ere long
 else the puck a liar call
 so good night unto you all
 give me your hands if we be friends
 and robin shall restore amends

scene messina
 much ado about nothing
act i
scene i before leonato's house
 enter leonato hero and beatrice with a
 messenger
leonato i learn in this letter that don peter of arragon
 comes this night to messina
messenger he is very near by this he was not three leagues off
 when i left him
leonato how many gentlemen have you lost in this action
messenger but few of any sort and none of name
leonato a victory is twice itself when the achiever brings
 home full numbers i find here that don peter hath
 bestowed much honour on a young florentine called claudio
messenger much deserved on his part and equally remembered by
 don pedro he hath borne himself beyond the
 promise of his age doing in the figure of a lamb
 the feats of a lion he hath indeed better
 bettered expectation than you must expect of me to
 tell you how
leonato he hath an uncle here in messina will be very much
 glad of it
messenger i have already delivered him letters and there
 appears much joy in him even so much that joy could
 not show itself modest enough without a badge of
 bitterness
leonato did he break out into tears
messenger in great measure
leonato a kind overflow of kindness there are no faces
 truer than those that are so washed how much
 better is it to weep at joy than to joy at weeping
beatrice i pray you is signior mountanto returned from the
 wars or no
messenger i know none of that name lady there was none such
 in the army of any sort
leonato what is he that you ask for niece
hero my cousin means signior benedick of padua
messenger o he's returned and as pleasant as ever he was
beatrice he set up his bills here in messina and challenged
 cupid at the flight and my uncle's fool reading
 the challenge subscribed for cupid and challenged
 him at the birdbolt i pray you how many hath he
 killed and eaten in these wars but how many hath
 he killed for indeed i promised to eat all of his killing
leonato faith niece you tax signior benedick too much
 but he'll be meet with you i doubt it not
messenger he hath done good service lady in these wars
beatrice you had musty victual and he hath holp to eat it
 he is a very valiant trencherman he hath an
 excellent stomach
messenger and a good soldier too lady
beatrice and a good soldier to a lady but what is he to a lord
messenger a lord to a lord a man to a man stuffed with all
 honourable virtues
beatrice it is so indeed he is no less than a stuffed man
 but for the stuffingwell we are all mortal
leonato you must not sir mistake my niece there is a
 kind of merry war betwixt signior benedick and her
 they never meet but there's a skirmish of wit
 between them
beatrice alas he gets nothing by that in our last
 conflict four of his five wits went halting off and
 now is the whole man governed with one so that if
 he have wit enough to keep himself warm let him
 bear it for a difference between himself and his
 horse for it is all the wealth that he hath left
 to be known a reasonable creature who is his
 companion now he hath every month a new sworn brother
messenger is't possible
