 poor i am stale a garment out of fashion
 and for i am richer than to hang by the walls
 i must be ripp'dto pieces with meo
 men's vows are women's traitors all good seeming
 by thy revolt o husband shall be thought
 put on for villany not born where't grows
 but worn a bait for ladies
pisanio good madam hear me
imogen true honest men being heard like false aeneas
 were in his time thought false and sinon's weeping
 did scandal many a holy tear took pity
 from most true wretchedness so thou posthumus
 wilt lay the leaven on all proper men
 goodly and gallant shall be false and perjured
 from thy great fall come fellow be thou honest
 do thou thy master's bidding when thou see'st him
 a little witness my obedience look
 i draw the sword myself take it and hit
 the innocent mansion of my love my heart
 fear not tis empty of all things but grief
 thy master is not there who was indeed
 the riches of it do his bidding strike
 thou mayst be valiant in a better cause
 but now thou seem'st a coward
pisanio hence vile instrument
 thou shalt not damn my hand
imogen why i must die
 and if i do not by thy hand thou art
 no servant of thy master's against selfslaughter
 there is a prohibition so divine
 that cravens my weak hand come here's my heart
 something's afore't soft soft we'll no defence
 obedient as the scabbard what is here
 the scriptures of the loyal leonatus
 all turn'd to heresy away away
 corrupters of my faith you shall no more
 be stomachers to my heart thus may poor fools
 believe false teachers though those that
 are betray'd
 do feel the treason sharply yet the traitor
 stands in worse case of woe
 and thou posthumus thou that didst set up
 my disobedience gainst the king my father
 and make me put into contempt the suits
 of princely fellows shalt hereafter find
 it is no act of common passage but
 a strain of rareness and i grieve myself
 to think when thou shalt be disedged by her
 that now thou tirest on how thy memory
 will then be pang'd by me prithee dispatch
 the lamb entreats the butcher where's thy knife
 thou art too slow to do thy master's bidding
 when i desire it too
pisanio o gracious lady
 since i received command to do this business
 i have not slept one wink
imogen do't and to bed then
pisanio i'll wake mine eyeballs blind first
imogen wherefore then
 didst undertake it why hast thou abused
 so many miles with a pretence this place
 mine action and thine own our horses labour
 the time inviting thee the perturb'd court
 for my being absent whereunto i never
 purpose return why hast thou gone so far
 to be unbent when thou hast ta'en thy stand
 the elected deer before thee
pisanio but to win time
 to lose so bad employment in the which
 i have consider'd of a course good lady
 hear me with patience
imogen talk thy tongue weary speak
 i have heard i am a strumpet and mine ear
 therein false struck can take no greater wound
 nor tent to bottom that but speak
pisanio then madam
 i thought you would not back again
imogen most like
 bringing me here to kill me
pisanio not so neither
 but if i were as wise as honest then
 my purpose would prove well it cannot be
 but that my master is abused
 some villain ay and singular in his art
 hath done you both this cursed injury
imogen some roman courtezan
pisanio no on my life
 i'll give but notice you are dead and send him
 some bloody sign of it for tis commanded
 i should do so you shall be miss'd at court
 and that will well confirm it
imogen why good fellow
 what shall i do the where where bide how live
 or in my life what comfort when i am
 dead to my husband
pisanio if you'll back to the court
imogen no court no father nor no more ado
 with that harsh noble simple nothing
 that cloten whose lovesuit hath been to me
 as fearful as a siege
pisanio if not at court
 then not in britain must you bide
imogen where then
 hath britain all the sun that shines day night
 are they not but in britain i the world's volume
 our britain seems as of it but not in t
 in a great pool a swan's nest prithee think
 there's livers out of britain
pisanio i am most glad
 you think of other place the ambassador
 lucius the roman comes to milfordhaven
 tomorrow now if you could wear a mind
 dark as your fortune is and but disguise
 that which to appear itself must not yet be
 but by selfdanger you should tread a course
 pretty and full of view yea haply near
 the residence of posthumus so nigh at least
 that though his actions were not visible yet
 report should render him hourly to your ear
 as truly as he moves
imogen o for such means
 though peril to my modesty not death on't
 i would adventure
pisanio well then here's the point
 you must forget to be a woman change
 command into obedience fear and niceness
 the handmaids of all women or more truly
 woman its pretty selfinto a waggish courage
 ready in gibes quickanswer'd saucy and
 as quarrelous as the weasel nay you must
 forget that rarest treasure of your cheek
 exposing itbut o the harder heart
 alack no remedyto the greedy touch
 of commonkissing titan and forget
 your laboursome and dainty trims wherein
 you made great juno angry
imogen nay be brief
 i see into thy end and am almost
 a man already
pisanio first make yourself but like one
 forethinking this i have already fit
 tis in my cloakbagdoublet hat hose all
 that answer to them would you in their serving
 and with what imitation you can borrow
 from youth of such a season fore noble lucius
 present yourself desire his service tell him
 wherein you're happywhich you'll make him know
 if that his head have ear in musicdoubtless
 with joy he will embrace you for he's honourable
 and doubling that most holy your means abroad
 you have me rich and i will never fail
 beginning nor supplyment
imogen thou art all the comfort
 the gods will diet me with prithee away
 there's more to be consider'd but we'll even
 all that good time will give us this attempt
 i am soldier to and will abide it with
 a prince's courage away i prithee
pisanio well madam we must take a short farewell
 lest being miss'd i be suspected of
 your carriage from the court my noble mistress
 here is a box i had it from the queen
 what's in't is precious if you are sick at sea
 or stomachqualm'd at land a dram of this
 will drive away distemper to some shade
 and fit you to your manhood may the gods
 direct you to the best
imogen amen i thank thee
 exeunt severally
