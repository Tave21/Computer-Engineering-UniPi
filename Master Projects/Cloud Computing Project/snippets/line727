katharine it is not you i call for
 saw ye none enter since i slept
griffith none madam
katharine no saw you not even now a blessed troop
 invite me to a banquet whose bright faces
 cast thousand beams upon me like the sun
 they promised me eternal happiness
 and brought me garlands griffith which i feel
 i am not worthy yet to wear i shall assuredly
griffith i am most joyful madam such good dreams
 possess your fancy
katharine bid the music leave
 they are harsh and heavy to me
 music ceases
patience do you note
 how much her grace is alter'd on the sudden
 how long her face is drawn how pale she looks
 and of an earthy cold mark her eyes
griffith she is going wench pray pray
patience heaven comfort her
 enter a messenger
messenger an't like your grace
katharine you are a saucy fellow
 deserve we no more reverence
griffith you are to blame
 knowing she will not lose her wonted greatness

 a gentleman sent from the king to see you
katharine admit him entrance griffith but this fellow

 with me since first you knew me but i pray you

 the king's request that i would visit you
 who grieves much for your weakness and by me
 sends you his princely commendations
 and heartily entreats you take good comfort
katharine o my good lord that comfort comes too late
 tis like a pardon after execution
 that gentle physic given in time had cured me
 but now i am past an comforts here but prayers

katharine so may he ever do and ever flourish
 when i shall dwell with worms and my poor name
 banish'd the kingdom patience is that letter
 i caused you write yet sent away
patience no madam
 giving it to katharine
katharine sir i most humbly pray you to deliver
 this to my lord the king
capucius most willing madam
katharine in which i have commended to his goodness
 the model of our chaste loves his young daughter
 the dews of heaven fall thick in blessings on her
 beseeching him to give her virtuous breeding
 she is young and of a noble modest nature
 i hope she will deserve welland a little
 to love her for her mother's sake that loved him
 heaven knows how dearly my next poor petition
 is that his noble grace would have some pity
 upon my wretched women that so long
 have follow'd both my fortunes faithfully
 of which there is not one i dare avow
 and now i should not lie but will deserve
 for virtue and true beauty of the soul
 for honesty and decent carriage
 a right good husband let him be a noble
 and sure those men are happy that shall have em
 the last is for my men they are the poorest
 but poverty could never draw em from me
 that they may have their wages duly paid em
 and something over to remember me by
 if heaven had pleased to have given me longer life
 and able means we had not parted thus
 these are the whole contents and good my lord
 by that you love the dearest in this world
 as you wish christian peace to souls departed
 stand these poor people's friend and urge the king
 to do me this last right
capucius by heaven i will
 or let me lose the fashion of a man
katharine i thank you honest lord remember me
 in all humility unto his highness
 say his long trouble now is passing
 out of this world tell him in death i bless'd him
 for so i will mine eyes grow dim farewell
 my lord griffith farewell nay patience

 call in more women when i am dead good wench

 with maiden flowers that all the world may know

 then lay me forth although unqueen'd yet like
 a queen and daughter to a king inter me
