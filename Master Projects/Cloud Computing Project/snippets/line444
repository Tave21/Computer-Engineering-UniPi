 i had rather give my body than my soul
angelo i talk not of your soul our compell'd sins
 stand more for number than for accompt
isabella how say you
angelo nay i'll not warrant that for i can speak
 against the thing i say answer to this
 i now the voice of the recorded law
 pronounce a sentence on your brother's life
 might there not be a charity in sin
 to save this brother's life
isabella please you to do't
 i'll take it as a peril to my soul
 it is no sin at all but charity
angelo pleased you to do't at peril of your soul
 were equal poise of sin and charity
isabella that i do beg his life if it be sin
 heaven let me bear it you granting of my suit
 if that be sin i'll make it my morn prayer
 to have it added to the faults of mine
 and nothing of your answer
angelo nay but hear me
 your sense pursues not mine either you are ignorant
 or seem so craftily and that's not good
isabella let me be ignorant and in nothing good
 but graciously to know i am no better
angelo thus wisdom wishes to appear most bright
 when it doth tax itself as these black masks
 proclaim an enshield beauty ten times louder
 than beauty could display'd but mark me
 to be received plain i'll speak more gross
 your brother is to die
isabella so
angelo and his offence is so as it appears
 accountant to the law upon that pain
isabella true
angelo admit no other way to save his life
 as i subscribe not that nor any other
 but in the loss of questionthat you his sister
 finding yourself desired of such a person
 whose credit with the judge or own great place
 could fetch your brother from the manacles
 of the allbuilding law and that there were
 no earthly mean to save him but that either
 you must lay down the treasures of your body
 to this supposed or else to let him suffer
 what would you do
isabella as much for my poor brother as myself
 that is were i under the terms of death
 the impression of keen whips i'ld wear as rubies
 and strip myself to death as to a bed
 that longing have been sick for ere i'ld yield
 my body up to shame
angelo then must your brother die
isabella and twere the cheaper way
 better it were a brother died at once
 than that a sister by redeeming him
 should die for ever
angelo were not you then as cruel as the sentence
 that you have slander'd so
isabella ignomy in ransom and free pardon
 are of two houses lawful mercy
 is nothing kin to foul redemption
angelo you seem'd of late to make the law a tyrant
 and rather proved the sliding of your brother
 a merriment than a vice
isabella o pardon me my lord it oft falls out
 to have what we would have we speak not what we mean
 i something do excuse the thing i hate
 for his advantage that i dearly love
angelo we are all frail
isabella else let my brother die
 if not a feodary but only he
 owe and succeed thy weakness
angelo nay women are frail too
isabella ay as the glasses where they view themselves
 which are as easy broke as they make forms
 women help heaven men their creation mar
 in profiting by them nay call us ten times frail
 for we are soft as our complexions are
 and credulous to false prints
angelo i think it well
 and from this testimony of your own sex
 since i suppose we are made to be no stronger
 than faults may shake our frameslet me be bold
 i do arrest your words be that you are
 that is a woman if you be more you're none
 if you be one as you are well express'd
 by all external warrants show it now
 by putting on the destined livery
isabella i have no tongue but one gentle my lord
 let me entreat you speak the former language
angelo plainly conceive i love you
isabella my brother did love juliet
 and you tell me that he shall die for it
angelo he shall not isabel if you give me love
isabella i know your virtue hath a licence in't
 which seems a little fouler than it is
 to pluck on others
angelo believe me on mine honour
 my words express my purpose
isabella ha little honour to be much believed
 and most pernicious purpose seeming seeming
 i will proclaim thee angelo look for't
 sign me a present pardon for my brother
 or with an outstretch'd throat i'll tell the world aloud
 what man thou art
angelo who will believe thee isabel
 my unsoil'd name the austereness of my life
 my vouch against you and my place i the state
 will so your accusation overweigh
 that you shall stifle in your own report
 and smell of calumny i have begun
 and now i give my sensual race the rein
 fit thy consent to my sharp appetite
 lay by all nicety and prolixious blushes
 that banish what they sue for redeem thy brother
 by yielding up thy body to my will
 or else he must not only die the death
 but thy unkindness shall his death draw out
 to lingering sufferance answer me tomorrow
 or by the affection that now guides me most
 i'll prove a tyrant to him as for you
 say what you can my false o'erweighs your true
 exit
isabella to whom should i complain did i tell this
 who would believe me o perilous mouths
 that bear in them one and the selfsame tongue
 either of condemnation or approof
 bidding the law make court'sy to their will
 hooking both right and wrong to the appetite
 to follow as it draws i'll to my brother
 though he hath fallen by prompture of the blood
 yet hath he in him such a mind of honour
 that had he twenty heads to tender down
 on twenty bloody blocks he'ld yield them up
 before his sister should her body stoop
 to such abhorr'd pollution
 then isabel live chaste and brother die
 more than our brother is our chastity
 i'll tell him yet of angelo's request
 and fit his mind to death for his soul's rest
 exit
 measure for measure
act iii
scene i a room in the prison
 enter duke vincentio disguised as before claudio
 and provost
duke vincentio so then you hope of pardon from lord angelo
claudio the miserable have no other medicine
 but only hope
 i've hope to live and am prepared to die
duke vincentio be absolute for death either death or life
 shall thereby be the sweeter reason thus with life
 if i do lose thee i do lose a thing
 that none but fools would keep a breath thou art
 servile to all the skyey influences
 that dost this habitation where thou keep'st
 hourly afflict merely thou art death's fool
 for him thou labour'st by thy flight to shun
 and yet runn'st toward him still thou art not noble
 for all the accommodations that thou bear'st
 are nursed by baseness thou'rt by no means valiant
 for thou dost fear the soft and tender fork
 of a poor worm thy best of rest is sleep
 and that thou oft provokest yet grossly fear'st
 thy death which is no more thou art not thyself
 for thou exist'st on many a thousand grains
 that issue out of dust happy thou art not
 for what thou hast not still thou strivest to get
 and what thou hast forget'st thou art not certain
 for thy complexion shifts to strange effects
 after the moon if thou art rich thou'rt poor
 for like an ass whose back with ingots bows
 thou bear's thy heavy riches but a journey
 and death unloads thee friend hast thou none
 for thine own bowels which do call thee sire
 the mere effusion of thy proper loins
 do curse the gout serpigo and the rheum
 for ending thee no sooner thou hast nor youth nor age
 but as it were an afterdinner's sleep
 dreaming on both for all thy blessed youth
 becomes as aged and doth beg the alms
 of palsied eld and when thou art old and rich
 thou hast neither heat affection limb nor beauty
 to make thy riches pleasant what's yet in this
 that bears the name of life yet in this life
 lie hid moe thousand deaths yet death we fear
 that makes these odds all even
claudio i humbly thank you
 to sue to live i find i seek to die
 and seeking death find life let it come on
isabella within what ho peace here grace and good company
provost who's there come in the wish deserves a welcome
duke vincentio dear sir ere long i'll visit you again
claudio most holy sir i thank you
 enter isabella
isabella my business is a word or two with claudio
provost and very welcome look signior here's your sister
duke vincentio provost a word with you
provost as many as you please
