 enter melun wounded
melun lead me to the revolts of england here
salisbury when we were happy we had other names
pembroke it is the count melun
salisbury wounded to death
melun fly noble english you are bought and sold
 unthread the rude eye of rebellion
 and welcome home again discarded faith
 seek out king john and fall before his feet
 for if the french be lords of this loud day
 he means to recompense the pains you take
 by cutting off your heads thus hath he sworn
 and i with him and many moe with me
 upon the altar at saint edmundsbury
 even on that altar where we swore to you
 dear amity and everlasting love
salisbury may this be possible may this be true
melun have i not hideous death within my view
 retaining but a quantity of life
 which bleeds away even as a form of wax
 resolveth from his figure gainst the fire
 what in the world should make me now deceive
 since i must lose the use of all deceit
 why should i then be false since it is true
 that i must die here and live hence by truth
 i say again if lewis do win the day
 he is forsworn if e'er those eyes of yours
 behold another day break in the east
 but even this night whose black contagious breath
 already smokes about the burning crest
 of the old feeble and daywearied sun
 even this ill night your breathing shall expire
 paying the fine of rated treachery
 even with a treacherous fine of all your lives
 if lewis by your assistance win the day
 commend me to one hubert with your king
 the love of him and this respect besides
 for that my grandsire was an englishman
 awakes my conscience to confess all this
 in lieu whereof i pray you bear me hence
 from forth the noise and rumour of the field
 where i may think the remnant of my thoughts
 in peace and part this body and my soul
 with contemplation and devout desires
salisbury we do believe thee and beshrew my soul
 but i do love the favour and the form
 of this most fair occasion by the which
 we will untread the steps of damned flight
 and like a bated and retired flood
 leaving our rankness and irregular course
 stoop low within those bounds we have o'erlook'd
 and cabby run on in obedience
 even to our ocean to our great king john
 my arm shall give thee help to bear thee hence
 for i do see the cruel pangs of death
 right in thine eye away my friends new flight
 and happy newness that intends old right
 exeunt leading off melun
 king john
act v
scene v the french camp
 enter lewis and his train
lewis the sun of heaven methought was loath to set
 but stay'd and made the western welkin blush
 when english measure backward their own ground
 in faint retire o bravely came we off
 when with a volley of our needless shot
 after such bloody toil we bid good night
 and wound our tattering colours clearly up
 last in the field and almost lords of it
 enter a messenger
messenger where is my prince the dauphin
lewis here what news
messenger the count melun is slain the english lords
 by his persuasion are again fall'n off
 and your supply which you have wish'd so long
 are cast away and sunk on goodwin sands
lewis ah foul shrewd news beshrew thy very heart
 i did not think to be so sad tonight
 as this hath made me who was he that said
 king john did fly an hour or two before
 the stumbling night did part our weary powers
messenger whoever spoke it it is true my lord
lewis well keep good quarter and good care tonight
 the day shall not be up so soon as i
 to try the fair adventure of tomorrow
 exeunt

act v
scene vi an open place in the neighbourhood of swinstead abbey
 enter the bastard and hubert severally
hubert who's there speak ho speak quickly or i shoot
bastard a friend what art thou
hubert of the part of england
bastard whither dost thou go
hubert what's that to thee why may not i demand
 of thine affairs as well as thou of mine
bastard hubert i think
hubert thou hast a perfect thought
 i will upon all hazards well believe
 thou art my friend that know'st my tongue so well
 who art thou
bastard who thou wilt and if thou please
 thou mayst befriend me so much as to think
 i come one way of the plantagenets
hubert unkind remembrance thou and eyeless night
 have done me shame brave soldier pardon me
 that any accent breaking from thy tongue
 should scape the true acquaintance of mine ear
bastard come come sans compliment what news abroad
hubert why here walk i in the black brow of night
 to find you out
bastard brief then and what's the news
hubert o my sweet sir news fitting to the night
 black fearful comfortless and horrible
bastard show me the very wound of this ill news
 i am no woman i'll not swoon at it
hubert the king i fear is poison'd by a monk
 i left him almost speechless and broke out
 to acquaint you with this evil that you might
 the better arm you to the sudden time
 than if you had at leisure known of this
bastard how did he take it who did taste to him
hubert a monk i tell you a resolved villain
 whose bowels suddenly burst out the king
 yet speaks and peradventure may recover
bastard who didst thou leave to tend his majesty
hubert why know you not the lords are all come back
 and brought prince henry in their company
 at whose request the king hath pardon'd them
 and they are all about his majesty
bastard withhold thine indignation mighty heaven
 and tempt us not to bear above our power
 i'll tell tree hubert half my power this night
 passing these flats are taken by the tide
 these lincoln washes have devoured them
 myself well mounted hardly have escaped
 away before conduct me to the king
 i doubt he will be dead or ere i come
 exeunt
 king john
act v
scene vii the orchard in swinstead abbey
 enter prince henry salisbury and bigot
prince henry it is too late the life of all his blood
 is touch'd corruptibly and his pure brain
 which some suppose the soul's frail dwellinghouse
 doth by the idle comments that it makes
 foretell the ending of mortality
 enter pembroke
pembroke his highness yet doth speak and holds belief
 that being brought into the open air
 it would allay the burning quality
 of that fell poison which assaileth him
prince henry let him be brought into the orchard here
 doth he still rage
 exit bigot
pembroke he is more patient
 than when you left him even now he sung
prince henry o vanity of sickness fierce extremes
 in their continuance will not feel themselves
 death having prey'd upon the outward parts
 leaves them invisible and his siege is now
 against the mind the which he pricks and wounds
 with many legions of strange fantasies
 which in their throng and press to that last hold
 confound themselves tis strange that death
 should sing
 i am the cygnet to this pale faint swan
 who chants a doleful hymn to his own death
 and from the organpipe of frailty sings
 his soul and body to their lasting rest
salisbury be of good comfort prince for you are born
 to set a form upon that indigest
 which he hath left so shapeless and so rude
 enter attendants and bigot carrying king john in a chair
king john ay marry now my soul hath elbowroom
 it would not out at windows nor at doors
 there is so hot a summer in my bosom
 that all my bowels crumble up to dust
 i am a scribbled form drawn with a pen
 upon a parchment and against this fire
 do i shrink up
prince henry how fares your majesty
king john poison'dill faredead forsook cast off
 and none of you will bid the winter come
 to thrust his icy fingers in my maw
 nor let my kingdom's rivers take their course
 through my burn'd bosom nor entreat the north
 to make his bleak winds kiss my parched lips
 and comfort me with cold i do not ask you much
 i beg cold comfort and you are so strait
 and so ingrateful you deny me that
prince henry o that there were some virtue in my tears
 that might relieve you
king john the salt in them is hot
 within me is a hell and there the poison
 is as a fiend confined to tyrannize
 on unreprievable condemned blood
 enter the bastard
