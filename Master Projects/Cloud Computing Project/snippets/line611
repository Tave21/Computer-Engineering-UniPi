 would i were dead but that methinks already
 what was he that did make it see my lord
 would you not deem it breathed and that those veins
 did verily bear blood
polixenes masterly done
 the very life seems warm upon her lip
leontes the fixture of her eye has motion in't
 as we are mock'd with art
paulina i'll draw the curtain
 my lord's almost so far transported that
 he'll think anon it lives
leontes o sweet paulina
 make me to think so twenty years together
 no settled senses of the world can match
 the pleasure of that madness let t alone
paulina i am sorry sir i have thus far stirr'd you but
 i could afflict you farther
leontes do paulina
 for this affliction has a taste as sweet
 as any cordial comfort still methinks
 there is an air comes from her what fine chisel
 could ever yet cut breath let no man mock me
 for i will kiss her
paulina good my lord forbear
 the ruddiness upon her lip is wet
 you'll mar it if you kiss it stain your own
 with oily painting shall i draw the curtain
leontes no not these twenty years
perdita so long could i
 stand by a looker on
paulina either forbear
 quit presently the chapel or resolve you
 for more amazement if you can behold it
 i'll make the statue move indeed descend
 and take you by the hand but then you'll think
 which i protest againsti am assisted
 by wicked powers
leontes what you can make her do
 i am content to look on what to speak
 i am content to hear for tis as easy
 to make her speak as move
paulina it is required
 you do awake your faith then all stand still
 on those that think it is unlawful business
 i am about let them depart
leontes proceed
 no foot shall stir
paulina music awake her strike
 music
 tis time descend be stone no more approach
 strike all that look upon with marvel come
 i'll fill your grave up stir nay come away
 bequeath to death your numbness for from him
 dear life redeems you you perceive she stirs
 hermione comes down
 start not her actions shall be holy as
 you hear my spell is lawful do not shun her
 until you see her die again for then
 you kill her double nay present your hand
 when she was young you woo'd her now in age
 is she become the suitor
leontes o she's warm
 if this be magic let it be an art
 lawful as eating
polixenes she embraces him
camillo she hangs about his neck
 if she pertain to life let her speak too
polixenes ay and make't manifest where she has lived
 or how stolen from the dead
paulina that she is living
 were it but told you should be hooted at
 like an old tale but it appears she lives
 though yet she speak not mark a little while
 please you to interpose fair madam kneel
 and pray your mother's blessing turn good lady
 our perdita is found
hermione you gods look down
 and from your sacred vials pour your graces
 upon my daughter's head tell me mine own
 where hast thou been preserved where lived how found
 thy father's court for thou shalt hear that i
 knowing by paulina that the oracle
 gave hope thou wast in being have preserved
 myself to see the issue
paulina there's time enough for that
 lest they desire upon this push to trouble
 your joys with like relation go together
 you precious winners all your exultation
 partake to every one i an old turtle
 will wing me to some wither'd bough and there
 my mate that's never to be found again
 lament till i am lost
leontes o peace paulina
 thou shouldst a husband take by my consent
 as i by thine a wife this is a match
 and made between's by vows thou hast found mine
 but how is to be question'd for i saw her
 as i thought dead and have in vain said many
 a prayer upon her grave i'll not seek far
 for him i partly know his mindto find thee
 an honourable husband come camillo
 and take her by the hand whose worth and honesty
 is richly noted and here justified
 by us a pair of kings let's from this place
 what look upon my brother both your pardons
 that e'er i put between your holy looks
 my ill suspicion this is your soninlaw
 and son unto the king who heavens directing
 is trothplight to your daughter good paulina
 lead us from hence where we may leisurely
 each one demand an answer to his part
 perform'd in this wide gap of time since first
 we were dissever'd hastily lead away

 enter king henry lord john of lancaster the earl
 of westmoreland sir walter blunt and others
king henry iv so shaken as we are so wan with care
 find we a time for frighted peace to pant
 and breathe shortwinded accents of new broils
 to be commenced in strands afar remote
 no more the thirsty entrance of this soil
 shall daub her lips with her own children's blood
 nor more shall trenching war channel her fields
 nor bruise her flowerets with the armed hoofs
 of hostile paces those opposed eyes
 which like the meteors of a troubled heaven
 all of one nature of one substance bred
 did lately meet in the intestine shock
 and furious close of civil butchery
 shall now in mutual wellbeseeming ranks
 march all one way and be no more opposed
 against acquaintance kindred and allies
 the edge of war like an illsheathed knife
 no more shall cut his master therefore friends
 as far as to the sepulchre of christ
 whose soldier now under whose blessed cross
 we are impressed and engaged to fight
 forthwith a power of english shall we levy
 whose arms were moulded in their mothers womb
 to chase these pagans in those holy fields
 over whose acres walk'd those blessed feet
 which fourteen hundred years ago were nail'd
 for our advantage on the bitter cross
 but this our purpose now is twelve month old
 and bootless tis to tell you we will go
 therefore we meet not now then let me hear
 of you my gentle cousin westmoreland
 what yesternight our council did decree
 in forwarding this dear expedience
westmoreland my liege this haste was hot in question
 and many limits of the charge set down
 but yesternight when all athwart there came
 a post from wales loaden with heavy news
 whose worst was that the noble mortimer
 leading the men of herefordshire to fight
 against the irregular and wild glendower
