but thou o lord shalt laugh at them thou shalt have all the heathen in derision
because of his strength will i wait upon thee for god is my defence
the god of my mercy shall prevent me god shall let me see my desire upon mine enemies
slay them not lest my people forget scatter them by thy power and bring them down o lord our shield
for the sin of their mouth and the words of their lips let them even be taken in their pride and for cursing and lying which they speak
consume them in wrath consume them that they may not be and let them know that god ruleth in jacob unto the ends of the earth selah
and at evening let them return and let them make a noise like a dog and go round about the city
let them wander up and down for meat and grudge if they be not satisfied
but i will sing of thy power yea i will sing aloud of thy mercy in the morning for thou hast been my defence and refuge in the day of my trouble
unto thee o my strength will i sing for god is my defence and the god of my mercy
o god thou hast cast us off thou hast scattered us thou hast been displeased o turn thyself to us again
thou hast made the earth to tremble thou hast broken it heal the breaches thereof for it shaketh
thou hast shewed thy people hard things thou hast made us to drink the wine of astonishment
thou hast given a banner to them that fear thee that it may be displayed because of the truth selah
that thy beloved may be delivered save with thy right hand and hear me
god hath spoken in his holiness i will rejoice i will divide shechem and mete out the valley of succoth
gilead is mine and manasseh is mine ephraim also is the strength of mine head judah is my lawgiver
moab is my washpot over edom will i cast out my shoe philistia triumph thou because of me
who will bring me into the strong city who will lead me into edom
wilt not thou o god which hadst cast us off and thou o god which didst not go out with our armies
give us help from trouble for vain is the help of man
through god we shall do valiantly for he it is that shall tread down our enemies
hear my cry o god attend unto my prayer
from the end of the earth will i cry unto thee when my heart is overwhelmed lead me to the rock that is higher than i
for thou hast been a shelter for me and a strong tower from the enemy
i will abide in thy tabernacle for ever i will trust in the covert of thy wings selah
for thou o god hast heard my vows thou hast given me the heritage of those that fear thy name
thou wilt prolong the king's life and his years as many generations
he shall abide before god for ever o prepare mercy and truth which may preserve him
so will i sing praise unto thy name for ever that i may daily perform my vows
truly my soul waiteth upon god from him cometh my salvation
he only is my rock and my salvation he is my defence i shall not be greatly moved
how long will ye imagine mischief against a man ye shall be slain all of you as a bowing wall shall ye be and as a tottering fence
they only consult to cast him down from his excellency they delight in lies they bless with their mouth but they curse inwardly selah
my soul wait thou only upon god for my expectation is from him
he only is my rock and my salvation he is my defence i shall not be moved
in god is my salvation and my glory the rock of my strength and my refuge is in god
trust in him at all times ye people pour out your heart before him god is a refuge for us selah
surely men of low degree are vanity and men of high degree are a lie to be laid in the balance they are altogether lighter than vanity
trust not in oppression and become not vain in robbery if riches increase set not your heart upon them
god hath spoken once twice have i heard this that power belongeth unto god
also unto thee o lord belongeth mercy for thou renderest to every man according to his work
o god thou art my god early will i seek thee my soul thirsteth for thee my flesh longeth for thee in a dry and thirsty land where no water is
to see thy power and thy glory so as i have seen thee in the sanctuary
because thy lovingkindness is better than life my lips shall praise thee
thus will i bless thee while i live i will lift up my hands in thy name
my soul shall be satisfied as with marrow and fatness and my mouth shall praise thee with joyful lips
when i remember thee upon my bed and meditate on thee in the night watches
because thou hast been my help therefore in the shadow of thy wings will i rejoice
my soul followeth hard after thee thy right hand upholdeth me
but those that seek my soul to destroy it shall go into the lower parts of the earth
they shall fall by the sword they shall be a portion for foxes
but the king shall rejoice in god every one that sweareth by him shall glory but the mouth of them that speak lies shall be stopped
hear my voice o god in my prayer preserve my life from fear of the enemy
hide me from the secret counsel of the wicked from the insurrection of the workers of iniquity
who whet their tongue like a sword and bend their bows to shoot their arrows even bitter words
that they may shoot in secret at the perfect suddenly do they shoot at him and fear not
they encourage themselves in an evil matter they commune of laying snares privily they say who shall see them
they search out iniquities they accomplish a diligent search both the inward thought of every one of them and the heart is deep
but god shall shoot at them with an arrow suddenly shall they be wounded
so they shall make their own tongue to fall upon themselves all that see them shall flee away
and all men shall fear and shall declare the work of god for they shall wisely consider of his doing
the righteous shall be glad in the lord and shall trust in him and all the upright in heart shall glory
praise waiteth for thee o god in sion and unto thee shall the vow be performed
o thou that hearest prayer unto thee shall all flesh come
iniquities prevail against me as for our transgressions thou shalt purge them away

by terrible things in righteousness wilt thou answer us o god of our salvation who art the confidence of all the ends of the earth and of them that are afar off upon the sea
which by his strength setteth fast the mountains being girded with power
which stilleth the noise of the seas the noise of their waves and the tumult of the people
they also that dwell in the uttermost parts are afraid at thy tokens thou makest the outgoings of the morning and evening to rejoice
thou visitest the earth and waterest it thou greatly enrichest it with the river of god which is full of water thou preparest them corn when thou hast so provided for it
thou waterest the ridges thereof abundantly thou settlest the furrows thereof thou makest it soft with showers thou blessest the springing thereof
thou crownest the year with thy goodness and thy paths drop fatness

which my lips have uttered and my mouth hath spoken when i was in trouble
i will offer unto thee burnt sacrifices of fatlings with the incense of rams i will offer bullocks with goats selah
come and hear all ye that fear god and i will declare what he hath done for my soul
i cried unto him with my mouth and he was extolled with my tongue
if i regard iniquity in my heart the lord will not hear me
but verily god hath heard me he hath attended to the voice of my prayer
blessed be god which hath not turned away my prayer nor his mercy from me
god be merciful unto us and bless us and cause his face to shine upon us selah
that thy way may be known upon earth thy saving health among all nations

o let the nations be glad and sing for joy for thou shalt judge the people righteously and govern the nations upon earth selah
let the people praise thee o god let all the people praise thee
then shall the earth yield her increase and god even our own god shall bless us

let god arise let his enemies be scattered let them also that hate him flee before him
as smoke is driven away so drive them away as wax melteth before the fire so let the wicked perish at the presence of god
but let the righteous be glad let them rejoice before god yea let them exceedingly rejoice

o god when thou wentest forth before thy people when thou didst march through the wilderness selah
the earth shook the heavens also dropped at the presence of god even sinai itself was moved at the presence of god the god of israel
thou o god didst send a plentiful rain whereby thou didst confirm thine inheritance when it was weary
thy congregation hath dwelt therein thou o god hast prepared of thy goodness for the poor
the lord gave the word great was the company of those that published it
kings of armies did flee apace and she that tarried at home divided the spoil
though ye have lien among the pots yet shall ye be as the wings of a dove covered with silver and her feathers with yellow gold
when the almighty scattered kings in it it was white as snow in salmon
the hill of god is as the hill of bashan an high hill as the hill of bashan
why leap ye ye high hills this is the hill which god desireth to dwell in yea the lord will dwell in it for ever
the chariots of god are twenty thousand even thousands of angels the lord is among them as in sinai in the holy place
thou hast ascended on high thou hast led captivity captive thou hast received gifts for men yea for the rebellious also that the lord god might dwell among them
blessed be the lord who daily loadeth us with benefits even the god of our salvation selah
he that is our god is the god of salvation and unto god the lord belong the issues from death
but god shall wound the head of his enemies and the hairy scalp of such an one as goeth on still in his trespasses
the lord said i will bring again from bashan i will bring my people again from the depths of the sea
that thy foot may be dipped in the blood of thine enemies and the tongue of thy dogs in the same
they have seen thy goings o god even the goings of my god my king in the sanctuary
the singers went before the players on instruments followed after among them were the damsels playing with timbrels
bless ye god in the congregations even the lord from the fountain of israel
there is little benjamin with their ruler the princes of judah and their council the princes of zebulun and the princes of naphtali
thy god hath commanded thy strength strengthen o god that which thou hast wrought for us
because of thy temple at jerusalem shall kings bring presents unto thee
rebuke the company of spearmen the multitude of the bulls with the calves of the people till every one submit himself with pieces of silver scatter thou the people that delight in war

o god thou art terrible out of thy holy places the god of israel is he that giveth strength and power unto his people blessed be god
save me o god for the waters are come in unto my soul
i sink in deep mire where there is no standing i am come into deep waters where the floods overflow me
i am weary of my crying my throat is dried mine eyes fail while i wait for my god
they that hate me without a cause are more than the hairs of mine head they that would destroy me being mine enemies wrongfully are mighty then i restored that which i took not away
o god thou knowest my foolishness and my sins are not hid from thee
let not them that wait on thee o lord god of hosts be ashamed for my sake let not those that seek thee be confounded for my sake o god of israel
because for thy sake i have borne reproach shame hath covered my face
i am become a stranger unto my brethren and an alien unto my mother's children
for the zeal of thine house hath eaten me up and the reproaches of them that reproached thee are fallen upon me
when i wept and chastened my soul with fasting that was to my reproach
i made sackcloth also my garment and i became a proverb to them
they that sit in the gate speak against me and i was the song of the drunkards
but as for me my prayer is unto thee o lord in an acceptable time o god in the multitude of thy mercy hear me in the truth of thy salvation
deliver me out of the mire and let me not sink let me be delivered from them that hate me and out of the deep waters
let not the waterflood overflow me neither let the deep swallow me up and let not the pit shut her mouth upon me
hear me o lord for thy lovingkindness is good turn unto me according to the multitude of thy tender mercies
and hide not thy face from thy servant for i am in trouble hear me speedily
draw nigh unto my soul and redeem it deliver me because of mine enemies
thou hast known my reproach and my shame and my dishonour mine adversaries are all before thee
reproach hath broken my heart and i am full of heaviness and i looked for some to take pity but there was none and for comforters but i found none
they gave me also gall for my meat and in my thirst they gave me vinegar to drink
let their table become a snare before them and that which should have been for their welfare let it become a trap
let their eyes be darkened that they see not and make their loins continually to shake
pour out thine indignation upon them and let thy wrathful anger take hold of them
let their habitation be desolate and let none dwell in their tents
for they persecute him whom thou hast smitten and they talk to the grief of those whom thou hast wounded
add iniquity unto their iniquity and let them not come into thy righteousness
let them be blotted out of the book of the living and not be written with the righteous
but i am poor and sorrowful let thy salvation o god set me up on high
i will praise the name of god with a song and will magnify him with thanksgiving
this also shall please the lord better than an ox or bullock that hath horns and hoofs
the humble shall see this and be glad and your heart shall live that seek god
for the lord heareth the poor and despiseth not his prisoners
let the heaven and earth praise him the seas and every thing that moveth therein
for god will save zion and will build the cities of judah that they may dwell there and have it in possession
the seed also of his servants shall inherit it and they that love his name shall dwell therein
make haste o god to deliver me make haste to help me o lord
let them be ashamed and confounded that seek after my soul let them be turned backward and put to confusion that desire my hurt
let them be turned back for a reward of their shame that say aha aha
let all those that seek thee rejoice and be glad in thee and let such as love thy salvation say continually let god be magnified
but i am poor and needy make haste unto me o god thou art my help and my deliverer o lord make no tarrying
in thee o lord do i put my trust let me never be put to confusion
deliver me in thy righteousness and cause me to escape incline thine ear unto me and save me
be thou my strong habitation whereunto i may continually resort thou hast given commandment to save me for thou art my rock and my fortress
deliver me o my god out of the hand of the wicked out of the hand of the unrighteous and cruel man
for thou art my hope o lord god thou art my trust from my youth
by thee have i been holden up from the womb thou art he that took me out of my mother's bowels my praise shall be continually of thee
i am as a wonder unto many but thou art my strong refuge
let my mouth be filled with thy praise and with thy honour all the day
cast me not off in the time of old age forsake me not when my strength faileth
for mine enemies speak against me and they that lay wait for my soul take counsel together
saying god hath forsaken him persecute and take him for there is none to deliver him
o god be not far from me o my god make haste for my help
let them be confounded and consumed that are adversaries to my soul let them be covered with reproach and dishonour that seek my hurt
but i will hope continually and will yet praise thee more and more
my mouth shall shew forth thy righteousness and thy salvation all the day for i know not the numbers thereof
i will go in the strength of the lord god i will make mention of thy righteousness even of thine only
o god thou hast taught me from my youth and hitherto have i declared thy wondrous works
now also when i am old and greyheaded o god forsake me not until i have shewed thy strength unto this generation and thy power to every one that is to come
thy righteousness also o god is very high who hast done great things o god who is like unto thee
thou which hast shewed me great and sore troubles shalt quicken me again and shalt bring me up again from the depths of the earth
thou shalt increase my greatness and comfort me on every side
