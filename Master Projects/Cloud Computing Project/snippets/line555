 i am no more touch'd than all priam's sons
 and jove forbid there should be done amongst us
 such things as might offend the weakest spleen
 to fight for and maintain
paris else might the world convince of levity
 as well my undertakings as your counsels
 but i attest the gods your full consent
 gave wings to my propension and cut off
 all fears attending on so dire a project
 for what alas can these my single arms
 what propugnation is in one man's valour
 to stand the push and enmity of those
 this quarrel would excite yet i protest
 were i alone to pass the difficulties
 and had as ample power as i have will
 paris should ne'er retract what he hath done
 nor faint in the pursuit
priam paris you speak
 like one besotted on your sweet delights
 you have the honey still but these the gall
 so to be valiant is no praise at all
paris sir i propose not merely to myself
 the pleasures such a beauty brings with it
 but i would have the soil of her fair rape
 wiped off in honourable keeping her
 what treason were it to the ransack'd queen
 disgrace to your great worths and shame to me
 now to deliver her possession up
 on terms of base compulsion can it be
 that so degenerate a strain as this
 should once set footing in your generous bosoms
 there's not the meanest spirit on our party
 without a heart to dare or sword to draw
 when helen is defended nor none so noble
 whose life were ill bestow'd or death unfamed
 where helen is the subject then i say
 well may we fight for her whom we know well
 the world's large spaces cannot parallel
hector paris and troilus you have both said well
 and on the cause and question now in hand
 have glozed but superficially not much
 unlike young men whom aristotle thought
 unfit to hear moral philosophy
 the reasons you allege do more conduce
 to the hot passion of distemper'd blood
 than to make up a free determination
 twixt right and wrong for pleasure and revenge
 have ears more deaf than adders to the voice
 of any true decision nature craves
 all dues be render'd to their owners now
 what nearer debt in all humanity
 than wife is to the husband if this law
 of nature be corrupted through affection
 and that great minds of partial indulgence
 to their benumbed wills resist the same
 there is a law in each wellorder'd nation
 to curb those raging appetites that are
 most disobedient and refractory
 if helen then be wife to sparta's king
 as it is known she is these moral laws
 of nature and of nations speak aloud
 to have her back return'd thus to persist
 in doing wrong extenuates not wrong
 but makes it much more heavy hector's opinion
 is this in way of truth yet ne'ertheless
 my spritely brethren i propend to you
 in resolution to keep helen still
 for tis a cause that hath no mean dependance
 upon our joint and several dignities
troilus why there you touch'd the life of our design
 were it not glory that we more affected
 than the performance of our heaving spleens
 i would not wish a drop of trojan blood
 spent more in her defence but worthy hector
 she is a theme of honour and renown
 a spur to valiant and magnanimous deeds
 whose present courage may beat down our foes
 and fame in time to come canonize us
 for i presume brave hector would not lose
 so rich advantage of a promised glory
 as smiles upon the forehead of this action
 for the wide world's revenue
hector i am yours
 you valiant offspring of great priamus
 i have a roisting challenge sent amongst
 the dun and factious nobles of the greeks
 will strike amazement to their drowsy spirits
 i was advertised their great general slept
 whilst emulation in the army crept
 this i presume will wake him
 exeunt
 troilus and cressida
act ii
scene iii the grecian camp before achilles tent
 enter thersites solus
thersites how now thersites what lost in the labyrinth of
 thy fury shall the elephant ajax carry it thus he
 beats me and i rail at him o worthy satisfaction
 would it were otherwise that i could beat him
 whilst he railed at me sfoot i'll learn to
 conjure and raise devils but i'll see some issue of
 my spiteful execrations then there's achilles a
 rare enginer if troy be not taken till these two
 undermine it the walls will stand till they fall of
 themselves o thou great thunderdarter of olympus
 forget that thou art jove the king of gods and
 mercury lose all the serpentine craft of thy
 caduceus if ye take not that little little less
 than little wit from them that they have which
 shortarmed ignorance itself knows is so abundant
 scarce it will not in circumvention deliver a fly
 from a spider without drawing their massy irons and
 cutting the web after this the vengeance on the
 whole camp or rather the boneache for that
 methinks is the curse dependent on those that war
 for a placket i have said my prayers and devil envy
 say amen what ho my lord achilles
 enter patroclus
patroclus who's there thersites good thersites come in and rail
thersites if i could have remembered a gilt counterfeit thou
 wouldst not have slipped out of my contemplation but
 it is no matter thyself upon thyself the common
 curse of mankind folly and ignorance be thine in
 great revenue heaven bless thee from a tutor and
 discipline come not near thee let thy blood be thy
 direction till thy death then if she that lays thee
 out says thou art a fair corse i'll be sworn and
 sworn upon't she never shrouded any but lazars
 amen where's achilles
patroclus what art thou devout wast thou in prayer
thersites ay the heavens hear me
 enter achilles

achilles he is a privileged man proceed thersites
thersites agamemnon is a fool achilles is a fool thersites
 is a fool and as aforesaid patroclus is a fool
achilles derive this come
thersites agamemnon is a fool to offer to command achilles
 achilles is a fool to be commanded of agamemnon
 thersites is a fool to serve such a fool and
 patroclus is a fool positive
patroclus why am i a fool
thersites make that demand of the prover it suffices me thou
 art look you who comes here
achilles patroclus i'll speak with nobody
 come in with me thersites
 exit
thersites here is such patchery such juggling and such
 knavery all the argument is a cuckold and a
 whore a good quarrel to draw emulous factions
 and bleed to death upon now the dry serpigo on
 the subject and war and lechery confound all
 exit
 enter agamemnon ulysses nestor diomedes and ajax
agamemnon where is achilles
patroclus within his tent but ill disposed my lord
agamemnon let it be known to him that we are here
 he shent our messengers and we lay by
 our appertainments visiting of him
 let him be told so lest perchance he think
 we dare not move the question of our place
 or know not what we are
patroclus i shall say so to him
 exit
ulysses we saw him at the opening of his tent
 he is not sick
ajax yes lionsick sick of proud heart you may call it
 melancholy if you will favour the man but by my
 head tis pride but why why let him show us the
 cause a word my lord
 takes agamemnon aside
nestor what moves ajax thus to bay at him
ulysses achilles hath inveigled his fool from him
nestor who thersites
ulysses he
nestor then will ajax lack matter if he have lost his argument
ulysses no you see he is his argument that has his
 argument achilles
nestor all the better their fraction is more our wish than
 their faction but it was a strong composure a fool
 could disunite
ulysses the amity that wisdom knits not folly may easily
 untie here comes patroclus
