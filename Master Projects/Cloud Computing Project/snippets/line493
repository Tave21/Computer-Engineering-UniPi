 and finds his trusty thisby's mantle slain
 whereat with blade with bloody blameful blade
 he bravely broach'd is boiling bloody breast
 and thisby tarrying in mulberry shade
 his dagger drew and died for all the rest
 let lion moonshine wall and lovers twain
 at large discourse while here they do remain
 exeunt prologue thisbe lion and moonshine
theseus i wonder if the lion be to speak
demetrius no wonder my lord one lion may when many asses do
wall in this same interlude it doth befall
 that i one snout by name present a wall
 and such a wall as i would have you think
 that had in it a crannied hole or chink
 through which the lovers pyramus and thisby
 did whisper often very secretly
 this loam this roughcast and this stone doth show
 that i am that same wall the truth is so
 and this the cranny is right and sinister
 through which the fearful lovers are to whisper
theseus would you desire lime and hair to speak better
demetrius it is the wittiest partition that ever i heard
 discourse my lord
 enter pyramus
theseus pyramus draws near the wall silence
pyramus o grimlook'd night o night with hue so black
 o night which ever art when day is not
 o night o night alack alack alack
 i fear my thisby's promise is forgot
 and thou o wall o sweet o lovely wall
 that stand'st between her father's ground and mine
 thou wall o wall o sweet and lovely wall
 show me thy chink to blink through with mine eyne
 wall holds up his fingers
 thanks courteous wall jove shield thee well for this
 but what see i no thisby do i see
 o wicked wall through whom i see no bliss
 cursed be thy stones for thus deceiving me
theseus the wall methinks being sensible should curse again
pyramus no in truth sir he should not deceiving me'
 is thisby's cue she is to enter now and i am to
 spy her through the wall you shall see it will
 fall pat as i told you yonder she comes
 enter thisbe
thisbe o wall full often hast thou heard my moans
 for parting my fair pyramus and me
 my cherry lips have often kiss'd thy stones
 thy stones with lime and hair knit up in thee
pyramus i see a voice now will i to the chink
 to spy an i can hear my thisby's face thisby
thisbe my love thou art my love i think
pyramus think what thou wilt i am thy lover's grace
 and like limander am i trusty still
thisbe and i like helen till the fates me kill
pyramus not shafalus to procrus was so true
thisbe as shafalus to procrus i to you
pyramus o kiss me through the hole of this vile wall
thisbe i kiss the wall's hole not your lips at all
pyramus wilt thou at ninny's tomb meet me straightway
thisbe tide life tide death i come without delay
 exeunt pyramus and thisbe
wall thus have i wall my part discharged so
 and being done thus wall away doth go
 exit
theseus now is the mural down between the two neighbours
demetrius no remedy my lord when walls are so wilful to hear
 without warning
hippolyta this is the silliest stuff that ever i heard
theseus the best in this kind are but shadows and the worst
 are no worse if imagination amend them
hippolyta it must be your imagination then and not theirs
theseus if we imagine no worse of them than they of
 themselves they may pass for excellent men here
 come two noble beasts in a man and a lion
 enter lion and moonshine
lion you ladies you whose gentle hearts do fear
 the smallest monstrous mouse that creeps on floor
 may now perchance both quake and tremble here
 when lion rough in wildest rage doth roar
 then know that i one snug the joiner am
 a lionfell nor else no lion's dam
 for if i should as lion come in strife
 into this place twere pity on my life
theseus a very gentle beast of a good conscience
demetrius the very best at a beast my lord that e'er i saw
lysander this lion is a very fox for his valour
theseus true and a goose for his discretion
demetrius not so my lord for his valour cannot carry his
 discretion and the fox carries the goose
theseus his discretion i am sure cannot carry his valour
 for the goose carries not the fox it is well
 leave it to his discretion and let us listen to the moon
moonshine this lanthorn doth the horned moon present
demetrius he should have worn the horns on his head
theseus he is no crescent and his horns are
 invisible within the circumference
moonshine this lanthorn doth the horned moon present
 myself the man i the moon do seem to be
theseus this is the greatest error of all the rest the man
 should be put into the lanthorn how is it else the
 man i the moon
demetrius he dares not come there for the candle for you
 see it is already in snuff
hippolyta i am aweary of this moon would he would change
theseus it appears by his small light of discretion that
 he is in the wane but yet in courtesy in all
 reason we must stay the time
lysander proceed moon
moonshine all that i have to say is to tell you that the
 lanthorn is the moon i the man in the moon this
 thornbush my thornbush and this dog my dog
demetrius why all these should be in the lanthorn for all
 these are in the moon but silence here comes thisbe
 enter thisbe
thisbe this is old ninny's tomb where is my love
lion roaring oh
 thisbe runs off
demetrius well roared lion
theseus well run thisbe
hippolyta well shone moon truly the moon shines with a
 good grace
 the lion shakes thisbe's mantle and exit
theseus well moused lion
lysander and so the lion vanished
demetrius and then came pyramus
 enter pyramus
pyramus sweet moon i thank thee for thy sunny beams
 i thank thee moon for shining now so bright
 for by thy gracious golden glittering gleams
 i trust to take of truest thisby sight
 but stay o spite
 but mark poor knight
 what dreadful dole is here
 eyes do you see
 how can it be
 o dainty duck o dear
 thy mantle good
 what stain'd with blood
 approach ye furies fell
 o fates come come
 cut thread and thrum
 quail crush conclude and quell
theseus this passion and the death of a dear friend would
 go near to make a man look sad
hippolyta beshrew my heart but i pity the man
pyramus o wherefore nature didst thou lions frame
 since lion vile hath here deflower'd my dear
 which isno nowhich was the fairest dame
 that lived that loved that liked that look'd
 with cheer
 come tears confound
 out sword and wound
 the pap of pyramus
 ay that left pap
 where heart doth hop
 stabs himself
 thus die i thus thus thus
 now am i dead
 now am i fled
 my soul is in the sky
 tongue lose thy light
 moon take thy flight
 exit moonshine
 now die die die die die
 dies
demetrius no die but an ace for him for he is but one
lysander less than an ace man for he is dead he is nothing
theseus with the help of a surgeon he might yet recover and
 prove an ass
hippolyta how chance moonshine is gone before thisbe comes
 back and finds her lover
theseus she will find him by starlight here she comes and
 her passion ends the play
 reenter thisbe
hippolyta methinks she should not use a long one for such a
 pyramus i hope she will be brief
demetrius a mote will turn the balance which pyramus which
 thisbe is the better he for a man god warrant us
 she for a woman god bless us
lysander she hath spied him already with those sweet eyes
demetrius and thus she means videlicet
thisbe asleep my love
 what dead my dove
 o pyramus arise
 speak speak quite dumb
 dead dead a tomb
 must cover thy sweet eyes
 these my lips
 this cherry nose
 these yellow cowslip cheeks
 are gone are gone
 lovers make moan
 his eyes were green as leeks
 o sisters three
 come come to me
 with hands as pale as milk
 lay them in gore
 since you have shore
 with shears his thread of silk
 tongue not a word
