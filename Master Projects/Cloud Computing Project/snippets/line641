 alarum enter suffolk with margaret in his hand
suffolk be what thou wilt thou art my prisoner
 gazes on her
 o fairest beauty do not fear nor fly
 for i will touch thee but with reverent hands
 i kiss these fingers for eternal peace
 and lay them gently on thy tender side
 who art thou say that i may honour thee
margaret margaret my name and daughter to a king
 the king of naples whosoe'er thou art
suffolk an earl i am and suffolk am i call'd
 be not offended nature's miracle
 thou art allotted to be ta'en by me
 so doth the swan her downy cygnets save
 keeping them prisoner underneath her wings
 yet if this servile usage once offend
 go and be free again as suffolk's friend
 she is going
 o stay i have no power to let her pass
 my hand would free her but my heart says no
 as plays the sun upon the glassy streams
 twinkling another counterfeited beam
 so seems this gorgeous beauty to mine eyes
 fain would i woo her yet i dare not speak
 i'll call for pen and ink and write my mind
 fie de la pole disable not thyself
 hast not a tongue is she not here
 wilt thou be daunted at a woman's sight
 ay beauty's princely majesty is such
 confounds the tongue and makes the senses rough
margaret say earl of suffolkif thy name be so
 what ransom must i pay before i pass
 for i perceive i am thy prisoner
suffolk how canst thou tell she will deny thy suit
 before thou make a trial of her love
margaret why speak'st thou not what ransom must i pay
suffolk she's beautiful and therefore to be woo'd
 she is a woman therefore to be won
margaret wilt thou accept of ransom yea or no
suffolk fond man remember that thou hast a wife
 then how can margaret be thy paramour
margaret i were best to leave him for he will not hear
suffolk there all is marr'd there lies a cooling card
margaret he talks at random sure the man is mad
suffolk and yet a dispensation may be had
margaret and yet i would that you would answer me
suffolk i'll win this lady margaret for whom
 why for my king tush that's a wooden thing
margaret he talks of wood it is some carpenter
suffolk yet so my fancy may be satisfied
 and peace established between these realms
 but there remains a scruple in that too
 for though her father be the king of naples
 duke of anjou and maine yet is he poor
 and our nobility will scorn the match
margaret hear ye captain are you not at leisure
suffolk it shall be so disdain they ne'er so much
 henry is youthful and will quickly yield
 madam i have a secret to reveal
margaret what though i be enthrall'd he seems a knight
 and will not any way dishonour me
suffolk lady vouchsafe to listen what i say
margaret perhaps i shall be rescued by the french
 and then i need not crave his courtesy
suffolk sweet madam give me a hearing in a cause
margaret tush women have been captivate ere now
suffolk lady wherefore talk you so
margaret i cry you mercy tis but quid for quo
suffolk say gentle princess would you not suppose
 your bondage happy to be made a queen
margaret to be a queen in bondage is more vile
 than is a slave in base servility
 for princes should be free
suffolk and so shall you
 if happy england's royal king be free
margaret why what concerns his freedom unto me
suffolk i'll undertake to make thee henry's queen
 to put a golden sceptre in thy hand
 and set a precious crown upon thy head
 if thou wilt condescend to be my
margaret what
suffolk his love
margaret i am unworthy to be henry's wife
suffolk no gentle madam i unworthy am
 to woo so fair a dame to be his wife
 and have no portion in the choice myself
 how say you madam are ye so content
margaret an if my father please i am content
suffolk then call our captains and our colours forth
 and madam at your father's castle walls
 we'll crave a parley to confer with him
 a parley sounded enter reignier on the walls
 see reignier see thy daughter prisoner
reignier to whom
suffolk to me
reignier suffolk what remedy
 i am a soldier and unapt to weep
 or to exclaim on fortune's fickleness
suffolk yes there is remedy enough my lord
 consent and for thy honour give consent
 thy daughter shall be wedded to my king
 whom i with pain have woo'd and won thereto
 and this her easyheld imprisonment
 hath gained thy daughter princely liberty
reignier speaks suffolk as he thinks
suffolk fair margaret knows
 that suffolk doth not flatter face or feign
reignier upon thy princely warrant i descend
 to give thee answer of thy just demand
