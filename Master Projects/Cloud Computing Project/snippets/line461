 put bars between the owners and their rights
 and so though yours not yours prove it so
 let fortune go to hell for it not i
 i speak too long but tis to peize the time
 to eke it and to draw it out in length
 to stay you from election
bassanio let me choose
 for as i am i live upon the rack
portia upon the rack bassanio then confess
 what treason there is mingled with your love
bassanio none but that ugly treason of mistrust
 which makes me fear the enjoying of my love
 there may as well be amity and life
 tween snow and fire as treason and my love
portia ay but i fear you speak upon the rack
 where men enforced do speak anything
bassanio promise me life and i'll confess the truth
portia well then confess and live
bassanio confess and love'
 had been the very sum of my confession
 o happy torment when my torturer
 doth teach me answers for deliverance
 but let me to my fortune and the caskets
portia away then i am lock'd in one of them
 if you do love me you will find me out
 nerissa and the rest stand all aloof
 let music sound while he doth make his choice
 then if he lose he makes a swanlike end
 fading in music that the comparison
 may stand more proper my eye shall be the stream
 and watery deathbed for him he may win
 and what is music then then music is
 even as the flourish when true subjects bow
 to a newcrowned monarch such it is
 as are those dulcet sounds in break of day
 that creep into the dreaming bridegroom's ear
 and summon him to marriage now he goes
 with no less presence but with much more love
 than young alcides when he did redeem
 the virgin tribute paid by howling troy
 to the seamonster i stand for sacrifice
 the rest aloof are the dardanian wives
 with bleared visages come forth to view
 the issue of the exploit go hercules
 live thou i live with much much more dismay
 i view the fight than thou that makest the fray
 music whilst bassanio comments on the caskets to himself
 
 song
 tell me where is fancy bred
 or in the heart or in the head
 how begot how nourished
 reply reply
 it is engender'd in the eyes
 with gazing fed and fancy dies
 in the cradle where it lies
 let us all ring fancy's knell
 i'll begin itding dong bell
all ding dong bell
bassanio so may the outward shows be least themselves
 the world is still deceived with ornament
 in law what plea so tainted and corrupt
 but being seasoned with a gracious voice
 obscures the show of evil in religion
 what damned error but some sober brow
 will bless it and approve it with a text
 hiding the grossness with fair ornament
 there is no vice so simple but assumes
 some mark of virtue on his outward parts
 how many cowards whose hearts are all as false
 as stairs of sand wear yet upon their chins
 the beards of hercules and frowning mars
 who inward search'd have livers white as milk
 and these assume but valour's excrement
 to render them redoubted look on beauty
 and you shall see tis purchased by the weight
 which therein works a miracle in nature
 making them lightest that wear most of it
 so are those crisped snaky golden locks
 which make such wanton gambols with the wind
 upon supposed fairness often known
 to be the dowry of a second head
 the skull that bred them in the sepulchre
 thus ornament is but the guiled shore
 to a most dangerous sea the beauteous scarf
 veiling an indian beauty in a word
 the seeming truth which cunning times put on
 to entrap the wisest therefore thou gaudy gold
 hard food for midas i will none of thee
 nor none of thee thou pale and common drudge
 tween man and man but thou thou meagre lead
 which rather threatenest than dost promise aught
 thy paleness moves me more than eloquence
 and here choose i joy be the consequence
portia aside how all the other passions fleet to air
 as doubtful thoughts and rashembraced despair
 and shuddering fear and greeneyed jealousy o love
 be moderate allay thy ecstasy
 in measure rein thy joy scant this excess
 i feel too much thy blessing make it less
 for fear i surfeit
bassanio what find i here
 opening the leaden casket
 fair portia's counterfeit what demigod
 hath come so near creation move these eyes
 or whether riding on the balls of mine
 seem they in motion here are sever'd lips
 parted with sugar breath so sweet a bar
 should sunder such sweet friends here in her hairs
 the painter plays the spider and hath woven
 a golden mesh to entrap the hearts of men
 faster than gnats in cobwebs but her eyes
 how could he see to do them having made one
 methinks it should have power to steal both his
 and leave itself unfurnish'd yet look how far
 the substance of my praise doth wrong this shadow
 in underprizing it so far this shadow
 doth limp behind the substance here's the scroll
 the continent and summary of my fortune
 reads
 you that choose not by the view
 chance as fair and choose as true
 since this fortune falls to you
 be content and seek no new
 if you be well pleased with this
 and hold your fortune for your bliss
 turn you where your lady is
 and claim her with a loving kiss
 a gentle scroll fair lady by your leave
 i come by note to give and to receive
 like one of two contending in a prize
 that thinks he hath done well in people's eyes
 hearing applause and universal shout
 giddy in spirit still gazing in a doubt
 whether these pearls of praise be his or no
 so thrice fair lady stand i even so
 as doubtful whether what i see be true
 until confirm'd sign'd ratified by you
portia you see me lord bassanio where i stand
 such as i am though for myself alone
 i would not be ambitious in my wish
 to wish myself much better yet for you
 i would be trebled twenty times myself
 a thousand times more fair ten thousand times more rich
 that only to stand high in your account
 i might in virtue beauties livings friends
 exceed account but the full sum of me
 is sum of something which to term in gross
 is an unlesson'd girl unschool'd unpractised
 happy in this she is not yet so old
 but she may learn happier than this
 she is not bred so dull but she can learn
 happiest of all is that her gentle spirit
 commits itself to yours to be directed
 as from her lord her governor her king
 myself and what is mine to you and yours
 is now converted but now i was the lord
 of this fair mansion master of my servants
 queen o'er myself and even now but now
 this house these servants and this same myself
 are yours my lord i give them with this ring
 which when you part from lose or give away
 let it presage the ruin of your love
 and be my vantage to exclaim on you
bassanio madam you have bereft me of all words
 only my blood speaks to you in my veins
 and there is such confusion in my powers
 as after some oration fairly spoke
 by a beloved prince there doth appear
 among the buzzing pleased multitude
 where every something being blent together
 turns to a wild of nothing save of joy
 express'd and not express'd but when this ring
 parts from this finger then parts life from hence
 o then be bold to say bassanio's dead
nerissa my lord and lady it is now our time
 that have stood by and seen our wishes prosper
 to cry good joy good joy my lord and lady
gratiano my lord bassanio and my gentle lady
 i wish you all the joy that you can wish
 for i am sure you can wish none from me
 and when your honours mean to solemnize
 the bargain of your faith i do beseech you
 even at that time i may be married too
bassanio with all my heart so thou canst get a wife
gratiano i thank your lordship you have got me one
 my eyes my lord can look as swift as yours
 you saw the mistress i beheld the maid
 you loved i loved for intermission
 no more pertains to me my lord than you
 your fortune stood upon the casket there
 and so did mine too as the matter falls
 for wooing here until i sweat again
 and sweating until my very roof was dry
 with oaths of love at last if promise last
 i got a promise of this fair one here
 to have her love provided that your fortune
 achieved her mistress
portia is this true nerissa
nerissa madam it is so you stand pleased withal
