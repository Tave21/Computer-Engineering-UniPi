second watchman marry that he had received a thousand ducats of
 don john for accusing the lady hero wrongfully
dogberry flat burglary as ever was committed
verges yea by mass that it is
sexton what else fellow

 disgrace hero before the whole assembly and not marry her
dogberry o villain thou wilt be condemned into everlasting
 redemption for this

conrade away you are an ass you are an ass
dogberry dost thou not suspect my place dost thou not
 suspect my years o that he were here to write me
 down an ass but masters remember that i am an
 ass though it be not written down yet forget not
 that i am an ass no thou villain thou art full of
 piety as shall be proved upon thee by good witness
 i am a wise fellow and which is more an officer
 and which is more a householder and which is
 more as pretty a piece of flesh as any is in
 messina and one that knows the law go to and a
 rich fellow enough go to and a fellow that hath
 had losses and one that hath two gowns and every
 thing handsome about him bring him away o that
 i had been writ down an ass
 exeunt
 much ado about nothing
act v
scene i before leonato's house
 enter leonato and antonio
antonio if you go on thus you will kill yourself
 and tis not wisdom thus to second grief
 against yourself
leonato i pray thee cease thy counsel
 which falls into mine ears as profitless
 as water in a sieve give not me counsel
 nor let no comforter delight mine ear
 but such a one whose wrongs do suit with mine
 bring me a father that so loved his child
 whose joy of her is overwhelm'd like mine
 and bid him speak of patience
 measure his woe the length and breadth of mine
 and let it answer every strain for strain
 as thus for thus and such a grief for such
 in every lineament branch shape and form
 if such a one will smile and stroke his beard
 bid sorrow wag cry hem when he should groan
 patch grief with proverbs make misfortune drunk
 with candlewasters bring him yet to me
 and i of him will gather patience
 but there is no such man for brother men
 can counsel and speak comfort to that grief
 which they themselves not feel but tasting it
 their counsel turns to passion which before
 would give preceptial medicine to rage
 fetter strong madness in a silken thread
 charm ache with air and agony with words
 no no tis all men's office to speak patience
 to those that wring under the load of sorrow
 but no man's virtue nor sufficiency
 to be so moral when he shall endure
 the like himself therefore give me no counsel
 my griefs cry louder than advertisement
antonio therein do men from children nothing differ
leonato i pray thee peace i will be flesh and blood
 for there was never yet philosopher
 that could endure the toothache patiently
 however they have writ the style of gods
 and made a push at chance and sufferance
antonio yet bend not all the harm upon yourself
 make those that do offend you suffer too
leonato there thou speak'st reason nay i will do so
 my soul doth tell me hero is belied
 and that shall claudio know so shall the prince
 and all of them that thus dishonour her
antonio here comes the prince and claudio hastily
 enter don pedro and claudio
don pedro good den good den
claudio good day to both of you
leonato hear you my lords
don pedro we have some haste leonato
leonato some haste my lord well fare you well my lord
 are you so hasty now well all is one
don pedro nay do not quarrel with us good old man
antonio if he could right himself with quarreling
 some of us would lie low
claudio who wrongs him
leonato marry thou dost wrong me thou dissembler thou
 nay never lay thy hand upon thy sword
 i fear thee not
claudio marry beshrew my hand
 if it should give your age such cause of fear
 in faith my hand meant nothing to my sword
leonato tush tush man never fleer and jest at me
 i speak not like a dotard nor a fool
 as under privilege of age to brag
 what i have done being young or what would do
 were i not old know claudio to thy head
 thou hast so wrong'd mine innocent child and me
 that i am forced to lay my reverence by
 and with grey hairs and bruise of many days
 do challenge thee to trial of a man
 i say thou hast belied mine innocent child
 thy slander hath gone through and through her heart
 and she lies buried with her ancestors
 o in a tomb where never scandal slept
 save this of hers framed by thy villany
claudio my villany
leonato thine claudio thine i say
don pedro you say not right old man
leonato my lord my lord
 i'll prove it on his body if he dare
 despite his nice fence and his active practise
 his may of youth and bloom of lustihood
claudio away i will not have to do with you
leonato canst thou so daff me thou hast kill'd my child
 if thou kill'st me boy thou shalt kill a man
antonio he shall kill two of us and men indeed
 but that's no matter let him kill one first
 win me and wear me let him answer me
 come follow me boy come sir boy come follow me
 sir boy i'll whip you from your foining fence
 nay as i am a gentleman i will
leonato brother
antonio content yourself god knows i loved my niece
 and she is dead slander'd to death by villains
 that dare as well answer a man indeed
 as i dare take a serpent by the tongue
 boys apes braggarts jacks milksops
leonato brother antony
antonio hold you content what man i know them yea
 and what they weigh even to the utmost scruple
 scrambling outfacing fashionmonging boys
 that lie and cog and flout deprave and slander
 go anticly show outward hideousness
 and speak off half a dozen dangerous words
 how they might hurt their enemies if they durst
 and this is all
leonato but brother antony
antonio come tis no matter
 do not you meddle let me deal in this
don pedro gentlemen both we will not wake your patience
 my heart is sorry for your daughter's death
 but on my honour she was charged with nothing
 but what was true and very full of proof
leonato my lord my lord
don pedro i will not hear you
leonato no come brother away i will be heard
antonio and shall or some of us will smart for it
 exeunt leonato and antonio
don pedro see see here comes the man we went to seek
 enter benedick
claudio now signior what news
benedick good day my lord
don pedro welcome signior you are almost come to part
 almost a fray
claudio we had like to have had our two noses snapped off
 with two old men without teeth
don pedro leonato and his brother what thinkest thou had
 we fought i doubt we should have been too young for them
benedick in a false quarrel there is no true valour i came
 to seek you both
claudio we have been up and down to seek thee for we are
 highproof melancholy and would fain have it beaten
 away wilt thou use thy wit
benedick it is in my scabbard shall i draw it
don pedro dost thou wear thy wit by thy side
claudio never any did so though very many have been beside
 their wit i will bid thee draw as we do the
 minstrels draw to pleasure us
don pedro as i am an honest man he looks pale art thou
 sick or angry
claudio what courage man what though care killed a cat
 thou hast mettle enough in thee to kill care
benedick sir i shall meet your wit in the career and you
 charge it against me i pray you choose another subject
claudio nay then give him another staff this last was
 broke cross
don pedro by this light he changes more and more i think
 he be angry indeed
claudio if he be he knows how to turn his girdle
benedick shall i speak a word in your ear
claudio god bless me from a challenge
benedick aside to claudio you are a villain i jest not
 i will make it good how you dare with what you
