2chr14 but the ark of god had david brought up from kirjathjearim to the place which david had prepared for it for he had pitched a tent for it at jerusalem
2chr15 moreover the brasen altar that bezaleel the son of uri the son of hur had made he put before the tabernacle of the lord and solomon and the congregation sought unto it
2chr16 and solomon went up thither to the brasen altar before the lord which was at the tabernacle of the congregation and offered a thousand burnt offerings upon it
2chr17 in that night did god appear unto solomon and said unto him ask what i shall give thee
2chr18 and solomon said unto god thou hast shewed great mercy unto david my father and hast made me to reign in his stead
2chr19 now o lord god let thy promise unto david my father be established for thou hast made me king over a people like the dust of the earth in multitude
2chr110 give me now wisdom and knowledge that i may go out and come in before this people for who can judge this thy people that is so great
2chr111 and god said to solomon because this was in thine heart and thou hast not asked riches wealth or honour nor the life of thine enemies neither yet hast asked long life but hast asked wisdom and knowledge for thyself that thou mayest judge my people over whom i have made thee king
2chr112 wisdom and knowledge is granted unto thee and i will give thee riches and wealth and honour such as none of the kings have had that have been before thee neither shall there any after thee have the like
2chr113 then solomon came from his journey to the high place that was at gibeon to jerusalem from before the tabernacle of the congregation and reigned over israel
2chr114 and solomon gathered chariots and horsemen and he had a thousand and four hundred chariots and twelve thousand horsemen which he placed in the chariot cities and with the king at jerusalem
2chr115 and the king made silver and gold at jerusalem as plenteous as stones and cedar trees made he as the sycomore trees that are in the vale for abundance
2chr116 and solomon had horses brought out of egypt and linen yarn the king's merchants received the linen yarn at a price
2chr117 and they fetched up and brought forth out of egypt a chariot for six hundred shekels of silver and an horse for an hundred and fifty and so brought they out horses for all the kings of the hittites and for the kings of syria by their means
2chr21 and solomon determined to build an house for the name of the lord and an house for his kingdom
2chr22 and solomon told out threescore and ten thousand men to bear burdens and fourscore thousand to hew in the mountain and three thousand and six hundred to oversee them
2chr23 and solomon sent to huram the king of tyre saying as thou didst deal with david my father and didst send him cedars to build him an house to dwell therein even so deal with me
2chr24 behold i build an house to the name of the lord my god to dedicate it to him and to burn before him sweet incense and for the continual shewbread and for the burnt offerings morning and evening on the sabbaths and on the new moons and on the solemn feasts of the lord our god this is an ordinance for ever to israel
2chr25 and the house which i build is great for great is our god above all gods
2chr26 but who is able to build him an house seeing the heaven and heaven of heavens cannot contain him who am i then that i should build him an house save only to burn sacrifice before him
2chr27 send me now therefore a man cunning to work in gold and in silver and in brass and in iron and in purple and crimson and blue and that can skill to grave with the cunning men that are with me in judah and in jerusalem whom david my father did provide
2chr28 send me also cedar trees fir trees and algum trees out of lebanon for i know that thy servants can skill to cut timber in lebanon and behold my servants shall be with thy servants
2chr29 even to prepare me timber in abundance for the house which i am about to build shall be wonderful great
2chr210 and behold i will give to thy servants the hewers that cut timber twenty thousand measures of beaten wheat and twenty thousand measures of barley and twenty thousand baths of wine and twenty thousand baths of oil
2chr211 then huram the king of tyre answered in writing which he sent to solomon because the lord hath loved his people he hath made thee king over them
2chr212 huram said moreover blessed be the lord god of israel that made heaven and earth who hath given to david the king a wise son endued with prudence and understanding that might build an house for the lord and an house for his kingdom
2chr213 and now i have sent a cunning man endued with understanding of huram my father's
2chr214 the son of a woman of the daughters of dan and his father was a man of tyre skilful to work in gold and in silver in brass in iron in stone and in timber in purple in blue and in fine linen and in crimson also to grave any manner of graving and to find out every device which shall be put to him with thy cunning men and with the cunning men of my lord david thy father
2chr215 now therefore the wheat and the barley the oil and the wine which my lord hath spoken of let him send unto his servants
2chr216 and we will cut wood out of lebanon as much as thou shalt need and we will bring it to thee in floats by sea to joppa and thou shalt carry it up to jerusalem
2chr217 and solomon numbered all the strangers that were in the land of israel after the numbering wherewith david his father had numbered them and they were found an hundred and fifty thousand and three thousand and six hundred
2chr218 and he set threescore and ten thousand of them to be bearers of burdens and fourscore thousand to be hewers in the mountain and three thousand and six hundred overseers to set the people a work
2chr31 then solomon began to build the house of the lord at jerusalem in mount moriah where the lord appeared unto david his father in the place that david had prepared in the threshingfloor of ornan the jebusite
2chr32 and he began to build in the second day of the second month in the fourth year of his reign
2chr33 now these are the things wherein solomon was instructed for the building of the house of god the length by cubits after the first measure was threescore cubits and the breadth twenty cubits
2chr34 and the porch that was in the front of the house the length of it was according to the breadth of the house twenty cubits and the height was an hundred and twenty and he overlaid it within with pure gold
2chr35 and the greater house he cieled with fir tree which he overlaid with fine gold and set thereon palm trees and chains
2chr36 and he garnished the house with precious stones for beauty and the gold was gold of parvaim
2chr37 he overlaid also the house the beams the posts and the walls thereof and the doors thereof with gold and graved cherubims on the walls
2chr38 and he made the most holy house the length whereof was according to the breadth of the house twenty cubits and the breadth thereof twenty cubits and he overlaid it with fine gold amounting to six hundred talents
2chr39 and the weight of the nails was fifty shekels of gold and he overlaid the upper chambers with gold
2chr310 and in the most holy house he made two cherubims of image work and overlaid them with gold
2chr311 and the wings of the cherubims were twenty cubits long one wing of the one cherub was five cubits reaching to the wall of the house and the other wing was likewise five cubits reaching to the wing of the other cherub
2chr312 and one wing of the other cherub was five cubits reaching to the wall of the house and the other wing was five cubits also joining to the wing of the other cherub
2chr313 the wings of these cherubims spread themselves forth twenty cubits and they stood on their feet and their faces were inward
2chr314 and he made the vail of blue and purple and crimson and fine linen and wrought cherubims thereon
2chr315 also he made before the house two pillars of thirty and five cubits high and the chapiter that was on the top of each of them was five cubits
2chr316 and he made chains as in the oracle and put them on the heads of the pillars and made an hundred pomegranates and put them on the chains
2chr317 and he reared up the pillars before the temple one on the right hand and the other on the left and called the name of that on the right hand jachin and the name of that on the left boaz
2chr41 moreover he made an altar of brass twenty cubits the length thereof and twenty cubits the breadth thereof and ten cubits the height thereof
2chr42 also he made a molten sea of ten cubits from brim to brim round in compass and five cubits the height thereof and a line of thirty cubits did compass it round about
2chr43 and under it was the similitude of oxen which did compass it round about ten in a cubit compassing the sea round about two rows of oxen were cast when it was cast
2chr44 it stood upon twelve oxen three looking toward the north and three looking toward the west and three looking toward the south and three looking toward the east and the sea was set above upon them and all their hinder parts were inward
2chr45 and the thickness of it was an handbreadth and the brim of it like the work of the brim of a cup with flowers of lilies and it received and held three thousand baths
2chr46 he made also ten lavers and put five on the right hand and five on the left to wash in them such things as they offered for the burnt offering they washed in them but the sea was for the priests to wash in
2chr47 and he made ten candlesticks of gold according to their form and set them in the temple five on the right hand and five on the left
2chr48 he made also ten tables and placed them in the temple five on the right side and five on the left and he made an hundred basons of gold
2chr49 furthermore he made the court of the priests and the great court and doors for the court and overlaid the doors of them with brass
2chr410 and he set the sea on the right side of the east end over against the south
2chr411 and huram made the pots and the shovels and the basons and huram finished the work that he was to make for king solomon for the house of god
2chr412 to wit the two pillars and the pommels and the chapiters which were on the top of the two pillars and the two wreaths to cover the two pommels of the chapiters which were on the top of the pillars
2chr413 and four hundred pomegranates on the two wreaths two rows of pomegranates on each wreath to cover the two pommels of the chapiters which were upon the pillars
2chr414 he made also bases and lavers made he upon the bases
2chr415 one sea and twelve oxen under it
2chr416 the pots also and the shovels and the fleshhooks and all their instruments did huram his father make to king solomon for the house of the lord of bright brass
2chr417 in the plain of jordan did the king cast them in the clay ground between succoth and zeredathah
2chr418 thus solomon made all these vessels in great abundance for the weight of the brass could not be found out
2chr419 and solomon made all the vessels that were for the house of god the golden altar also and the tables whereon the shewbread was set
2chr420 moreover the candlesticks with their lamps that they should burn after the manner before the oracle of pure gold
2chr421 and the flowers and the lamps and the tongs made he of gold and that perfect gold
2chr422 and the snuffers and the basons and the spoons and the censers of pure gold and the entry of the house the inner doors thereof for the most holy place and the doors of the house of the temple were of gold
2chr51 thus all the work that solomon made for the house of the lord was finished and solomon brought in all the things that david his father had dedicated and the silver and the gold and all the instruments put he among the treasures of the house of god
2chr52 then solomon assembled the elders of israel and all the heads of the tribes the chief of the fathers of the children of israel unto jerusalem to bring up the ark of the covenant of the lord out of the city of david which is zion
2chr53 wherefore all the men of israel assembled themselves unto the king in the feast which was in the seventh month
2chr54 and all the elders of israel came and the levites took up the ark
2chr55 and they brought up the ark and the tabernacle of the congregation and all the holy vessels that were in the tabernacle these did the priests and the levites bring up
2chr56 also king solomon and all the congregation of israel that were assembled unto him before the ark sacrificed sheep and oxen which could not be told nor numbered for multitude
2chr57 and the priests brought in the ark of the covenant of the lord unto his place to the oracle of the house into the most holy place even under the wings of the cherubims
2chr58 for the cherubims spread forth their wings over the place of the ark and the cherubims covered the ark and the staves thereof above
2chr59 and they drew out the staves of the ark that the ends of the staves were seen from the ark before the oracle but they were not seen without and there it is unto this day
2chr510 there was nothing in the ark save the two tables which moses put therein at horeb when the lord made a covenant with the children of israel when they came out of egypt
2chr511 and it came to pass when the priests were come out of the holy place for all the priests that were present were sanctified and did not then wait by course
2chr512 also the levites which were the singers all of them of asaph of heman of jeduthun with their sons and their brethren being arrayed in white linen having cymbals and psalteries and harps stood at the east end of the altar and with them an hundred and twenty priests sounding with trumpets
2chr513 it came even to pass as the trumpeters and singers were as one to make one sound to be heard in praising and thanking the lord and when they lifted up their voice with the trumpets and cymbals and instruments of musick and praised the lord saying for he is good for his mercy endureth for ever that then the house was filled with a cloud even the house of the lord
2chr514 so that the priests could not stand to minister by reason of the cloud for the glory of the lord had filled the house of god
2chr61 then said solomon the lord hath said that he would dwell in the thick darkness
2chr62 but i have built an house of habitation for thee and a place for thy dwelling for ever
2chr63 and the king turned his face and blessed the whole congregation of israel and all the congregation of israel stood
2chr64 and he said blessed be the lord god of israel who hath with his hands fulfilled that which he spake with his mouth to my father david saying
2chr65 since the day that i brought forth my people out of the land of egypt i chose no city among all the tribes of israel to build an house in that my name might be there neither chose i any man to be a ruler over my people israel
2chr66 but i have chosen jerusalem that my name might be there and have chosen david to be over my people israel
2chr67 now it was in the heart of david my father to build an house for the name of the lord god of israel
2chr68 but the lord said to david my father forasmuch as it was in thine heart to build an house for my name thou didst well in that it was in thine heart
2chr69 notwithstanding thou shalt not build the house but thy son which shall come forth out of thy loins he shall build the house for my name
2chr610 the lord therefore hath performed his word that he hath spoken for i am risen up in the room of david my father and am set on the throne of israel as the lord promised and have built the house for the name of the lord god of israel
2chr611 and in it have i put the ark wherein is the covenant of the lord that he made with the children of israel
2chr612 and he stood before the altar of the lord in the presence of all the congregation of israel and spread forth his hands
2chr613 for solomon had made a brasen scaffold of five cubits long and five cubits broad and three cubits high and had set it in the midst of the court and upon it he stood and kneeled down upon his knees before all the congregation of israel and spread forth his hands toward heaven
2chr614 and said o lord god of israel there is no god like thee in the heaven nor in the earth which keepest covenant and shewest mercy unto thy servants that walk before thee with all their hearts
2chr615 thou which hast kept with thy servant david my father that which thou hast promised him and spakest with thy mouth and hast fulfilled it with thine hand as it is this day
2chr616 now therefore o lord god of israel keep with thy servant david my father that which thou hast promised him saying there shall not fail thee a man in my sight to sit upon the throne of israel yet so that thy children take heed to their way to walk in my law as thou hast walked before me
2chr617 now then o lord god of israel let thy word be verified which thou hast spoken unto thy servant david
2chr618 but will god in very deed dwell with men on the earth behold heaven and the heaven of heavens cannot contain thee how much less this house which i have built
2chr619 have respect therefore to the prayer of thy servant and to his supplication o lord my god to hearken unto the cry and the prayer which thy servant prayeth before thee
2chr620 that thine eyes may be open upon this house day and night upon the place whereof thou hast said that thou wouldest put thy name there to hearken unto the prayer which thy servant prayeth toward this place
2chr621 hearken therefore unto the supplications of thy servant and of thy people israel which they shall make toward this place hear thou from thy dwelling place even from heaven and when thou hearest forgive
2chr622 if a man sin against his neighbour and an oath be laid upon him to make him swear and the oath come before thine altar in this house
2chr623 then hear thou from heaven and do and judge thy servants by requiting the wicked by recompensing his way upon his own head and by justifying the righteous by giving him according to his righteousness
2chr624 and if thy people israel be put to the worse before the enemy because they have sinned against thee and shall return and confess thy name and pray and make supplication before thee in this house
2chr625 then hear thou from the heavens and forgive the sin of thy people israel and bring them again unto the land which thou gavest to them and to their fathers
2chr626 when the heaven is shut up and there is no rain because they have sinned against thee yet if they pray toward this place and confess thy name and turn from their sin when thou dost afflict them
2chr627 then hear thou from heaven and forgive the sin of thy servants and of thy people israel when thou hast taught them the good way wherein they should walk and send rain upon thy land which thou hast given unto thy people for an inheritance
2chr628 if there be dearth in the land if there be pestilence if there be blasting or mildew locusts or caterpillers if their enemies besiege them in the cities of their land whatsoever sore or whatsoever sickness there be
2chr629 then what prayer or what supplication soever shall be made of any man or of all thy people israel when every one shall know his own sore and his own grief and shall spread forth his hands in this house
2chr630 then hear thou from heaven thy dwelling place and forgive and render unto every man according unto all his ways whose heart thou knowest for thou only knowest the hearts of the children of men
2chr631 that they may fear thee to walk in thy ways so long as they live in the land which thou gavest unto our fathers
2chr632 moreover concerning the stranger which is not of thy people israel but is come from a far country for thy great name's sake and thy mighty hand and thy stretched out arm if they come and pray in this house
2chr633 then hear thou from the heavens even from thy dwelling place and do according to all that the stranger calleth to thee for that all people of the earth may know thy name and fear thee as doth thy people israel and may know that this house which i have built is called by thy name
2chr634 if thy people go out to war against their enemies by the way that thou shalt send them and they pray unto thee toward this city which thou hast chosen and the house which i have built for thy name
2chr635 then hear thou from the heavens their prayer and their supplication and maintain their cause
2chr636 if they sin against thee for there is no man which sinneth not and thou be angry with them and deliver them over before their enemies and they carry them away captives unto a land far off or near
2chr637 yet if they bethink themselves in the land whither they are carried captive and turn and pray unto thee in the land of their captivity saying we have sinned we have done amiss and have dealt wickedly
2chr638 if they return to thee with all their heart and with all their soul in the land of their captivity whither they have carried them captives and pray toward their land which thou gavest unto their fathers and toward the city which thou hast chosen and toward the house which i have built for thy name
2chr639 then hear thou from the heavens even from thy dwelling place their prayer and their supplications and maintain their cause and forgive thy people which have sinned against thee
2chr640 now my god let i beseech thee thine eyes be open and let thine ears be attent unto the prayer that is made in this place
2chr641 now therefore arise o lord god into thy resting place thou and the ark of thy strength let thy priests o lord god be clothed with salvation and let thy saints rejoice in goodness
2chr642 o lord god turn not away the face of thine anointed remember the mercies of david thy servant
2chr71 now when solomon had made an end of praying the fire came down from heaven and consumed the burnt offering and the sacrifices and the glory of the lord filled the house
2chr72 and the priests could not enter into the house of the lord because the glory of the lord had filled the lord's house
2chr73 and when all the children of israel saw how the fire came down and the glory of the lord upon the house they bowed themselves with their faces to the ground upon the pavement and worshipped and praised the lord saying for he is good for his mercy endureth for ever
2chr74 then the king and all the people offered sacrifices before the lord
2chr75 and king solomon offered a sacrifice of twenty and two thousand oxen and an hundred and twenty thousand sheep so the king and all the people dedicated the house of god
2chr76 and the priests waited on their offices the levites also with instruments of musick of the lord which david the king had made to praise the lord because his mercy endureth for ever when david praised by their ministry and the priests sounded trumpets before them and all israel stood
2chr77 moreover solomon hallowed the middle of the court that was before the house of the lord for there he offered burnt offerings and the fat of the peace offerings because the brasen altar which solomon had made was not able to receive the burnt offerings and the meat offerings and the fat
2chr78 also at the same time solomon kept the feast seven days and all israel with him a very great congregation from the entering in of hamath unto the river of egypt
2chr79 and in the eighth day they made a solemn assembly for they kept the dedication of the altar seven days and the feast seven days
2chr710 and on the three and twentieth day of the seventh month he sent the people away into their tents glad and merry in heart for the goodness that the lord had shewed unto david and to solomon and to israel his people
2chr711 thus solomon finished the house of the lord and the king's house and all that came into solomon's heart to make in the house of the lord and in his own house he prosperously effected
2chr712 and the lord appeared to solomon by night and said unto him i have heard thy prayer and have chosen this place to myself for an house of sacrifice
2chr713 if i shut up heaven that there be no rain or if i command the locusts to devour the land or if i send pestilence among my people
2chr714 if my people which are called by my name shall humble themselves and pray and seek my face and turn from their wicked ways then will i hear from heaven and will forgive their sin and will heal their land
2chr715 now mine eyes shall be open and mine ears attent unto the prayer that is made in this place
2chr716 for now have i chosen and sanctified this house that my name may be there for ever and mine eyes and mine heart shall be there perpetually
2chr717 and as for thee if thou wilt walk before me as david thy father walked and do according to all that i have commanded thee and shalt observe my statutes and my judgments
2chr718 then will i stablish the throne of thy kingdom according as i have covenanted with david thy father saying there shall not fail thee a man to be ruler in israel
2chr719 but if ye turn away and forsake my statutes and my commandments which i have set before you and shall go and serve other gods and worship them
2chr720 then will i pluck them up by the roots out of my land which i have given them and this house which i have sanctified for my name will i cast out of my sight and will make it to be a proverb and a byword among all nations
2chr721 and this house which is high shall be an astonishment to every one that passeth by it so that he shall say why hath the lord done thus unto this land and unto this house
2chr722 and it shall be answered because they forsook the lord god of their fathers which brought them forth out of the land of egypt and laid hold on other gods and worshipped them and served them therefore hath he brought all this evil upon them
2chr81 and it came to pass at the end of twenty years wherein solomon had built the house of the lord and his own house
2chr82 that the cities which huram had restored to solomon solomon built them and caused the children of israel to dwell there
2chr83 and solomon went to hamathzobah and prevailed against it
2chr84 and he built tadmor in the wilderness and all the store cities which he built in hamath
2chr85 also he built bethhoron the upper and bethhoron the nether fenced cities with walls gates and bars
2chr86 and baalath and all the store cities that solomon had and all the chariot cities and the cities of the horsemen and all that solomon desired to build in jerusalem and in lebanon and throughout all the land of his dominion
2chr87 as for all the people that were left of the hittites and the amorites and the perizzites and the hivites and the jebusites which were not of israel
2chr88 but of their children who were left after them in the land whom the children of israel consumed not them did solomon make to pay tribute until this day
2chr89 but of the children of israel did solomon make no servants for his work but they were men of war and chief of his captains and captains of his chariots and horsemen
2chr810 and these were the chief of king solomon's officers even two hundred and fifty that bare rule over the people
2chr811 and solomon brought up the daughter of pharaoh out of the city of david unto the house that he had built for her for he said my wife shall not dwell in the house of david king of israel because the places are holy whereunto the ark of the lord hath come
2chr812 then solomon offered burnt offerings unto the lord on the altar of the lord which he had built before the porch
2chr813 even after a certain rate every day offering according to the commandment of moses on the sabbaths and on the new moons and on the solemn feasts three times in the year even in the feast of unleavened bread and in the feast of weeks and in the feast of tabernacles
2chr814 and he appointed according to the order of david his father the courses of the priests to their service and the levites to their charges to praise and minister before the priests as the duty of every day required the porters also by their courses at every gate for so had david the man of god commanded
2chr815 and they departed not from the commandment of the king unto the priests and levites concerning any matter or concerning the treasures
2chr816 now all the work of solomon was prepared unto the day of the foundation of the house of the lord and until it was finished so the house of the lord was perfected
2chr817 then went solomon to eziongeber and to eloth at the sea side in the land of edom
2chr818 and huram sent him by the hands of his servants ships and servants that had knowledge of the sea and they went with the servants of solomon to ophir and took thence four hundred and fifty talents of gold and brought them to king solomon
2chr91 and when the queen of sheba heard of the fame of solomon she came to prove solomon with hard questions at jerusalem with a very great company and camels that bare spices and gold in abundance and precious stones and when she was come to solomon she communed with him of all that was in her heart
2chr92 and solomon told her all her questions and there was nothing hid from solomon which he told her not
2chr93 and when the queen of sheba had seen the wisdom of solomon and the house that he had built
2chr94 and the meat of his table and the sitting of his servants and the attendance of his ministers and their apparel his cupbearers also and their apparel and his ascent by which he went up into the house of the lord there was no more spirit in her
2chr95 and she said to the king it was a true report which i heard in mine own land of thine acts and of thy wisdom
2chr96 howbeit i believed not their words until i came and mine eyes had seen it and behold the one half of the greatness of thy wisdom was not told me for thou exceedest the fame that i heard
2chr97 happy are thy men and happy are these thy servants which stand continually before thee and hear thy wisdom
2chr98 blessed be the lord thy god which delighted in thee to set thee on his throne to be king for the lord thy god because thy god loved israel to establish them for ever therefore made he thee king over them to do judgment and justice
2chr99 and she gave the king an hundred and twenty talents of gold and of spices great abundance and precious stones neither was there any such spice as the queen of sheba gave king solomon
2chr910 and the servants also of huram and the servants of solomon which brought gold from ophir brought algum trees and precious stones
2chr911 and the king made of the algum trees terraces to the house of the lord and to the king's palace and harps and psalteries for singers and there were none such seen before in the land of judah
2chr912 and king solomon gave to the queen of sheba all her desire whatsoever she asked beside that which she had brought unto the king so she turned and went away to her own land she and her servants
2chr913 now the weight of gold that came to solomon in one year was six hundred and threescore and six talents of gold
2chr914 beside that which chapmen and merchants brought and all the kings of arabia and governors of the country brought gold and silver to solomon
2chr915 and king solomon made two hundred targets of beaten gold six hundred shekels of beaten gold went to one target
2chr916 and three hundred shields made he of beaten gold three hundred shekels of gold went to one shield and the king put them in the house of the forest of lebanon
2chr917 moreover the king made a great throne of ivory and overlaid it with pure gold
2chr918 and there were six steps to the throne with a footstool of gold which were fastened to the throne and stays on each side of the sitting place and two lions standing by the stays
2chr919 and twelve lions stood there on the one side and on the other upon the six steps there was not the like made in any kingdom
2chr920 and all the drinking vessels of king solomon were of gold and all the vessels of the house of the forest of lebanon were of pure gold none were of silver it was not any thing accounted of in the days of solomon
2chr921 for the king's ships went to tarshish with the servants of huram every three years once came the ships of tarshish bringing gold and silver ivory and apes and peacocks
2chr922 and king solomon passed all the kings of the earth in riches and wisdom
2chr923 and all the kings of the earth sought the presence of solomon to hear his wisdom that god had put in his heart
2chr924 and they brought every man his present vessels of silver and vessels of gold and raiment harness and spices horses and mules a rate year by year
2chr925 and solomon had four thousand stalls for horses and chariots and twelve thousand horsemen whom he bestowed in the chariot cities and with the king at jerusalem
2chr926 and he reigned over all the kings from the river even unto the land of the philistines and to the border of egypt
2chr927 and the king made silver in jerusalem as stones and cedar trees made he as the sycomore trees that are in the low plains in abundance
2chr928 and they brought unto solomon horses out of egypt and out of all lands
2chr929 now the rest of the acts of solomon first and last are they not written in the book of nathan the prophet and in the prophecy of ahijah the shilonite and in the visions of iddo the seer against jeroboam the son of nebat
2chr930 and solomon reigned in jerusalem over all israel forty years
