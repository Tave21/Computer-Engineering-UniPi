the coward conquest of a wretch's knife
too base of thee to be remembered
 the worth of that is that which it contains
 and that is this and this with thee remains
lxxv
so are you to my thoughts as food to life
or as sweetseason'd showers are to the ground
and for the peace of you i hold such strife
as twixt a miser and his wealth is found
now proud as an enjoyer and anon
doubting the filching age will steal his treasure
now counting best to be with you alone
then better'd that the world may see my pleasure
sometime all full with feasting on your sight
and by and by clean starved for a look
possessing or pursuing no delight
save what is had or must from you be took
 thus do i pine and surfeit day by day
 or gluttoning on all or all away
lxxvi
why is my verse so barren of new pride
so far from variation or quick change
why with the time do i not glance aside
to newfound methods and to compounds strange
why write i still all one ever the same
and keep invention in a noted weed
that every word doth almost tell my name
showing their birth and where they did proceed
o know sweet love i always write of you
and you and love are still my argument
so all my best is dressing old words new
spending again what is already spent
 for as the sun is daily new and old
 so is my love still telling what is told
lxxvii
thy glass will show thee how thy beauties wear
thy dial how thy precious minutes waste
the vacant leaves thy mind's imprint will bear
and of this book this learning mayst thou taste
the wrinkles which thy glass will truly show
of mouthed graves will give thee memory
thou by thy dial's shady stealth mayst know
time's thievish progress to eternity
look what thy memory can not contain
commit to these waste blanks and thou shalt find
those children nursed deliver'd from thy brain
to take a new acquaintance of thy mind
 these offices so oft as thou wilt look
 shall profit thee and much enrich thy book
lxxviii
so oft have i invoked thee for my muse
and found such fair assistance in my verse
as every alien pen hath got my use
and under thee their poesy disperse
thine eyes that taught the dumb on high to sing
and heavy ignorance aloft to fly
have added feathers to the learned's wing
and given grace a double majesty
yet be most proud of that which i compile
whose influence is thine and born of thee
in others works thou dost but mend the style
and arts with thy sweet graces graced be
 but thou art all my art and dost advance
 as high as learning my rude ignorance
lxxix
whilst i alone did call upon thy aid
my verse alone had all thy gentle grace
but now my gracious numbers are decay'd
and my sick muse doth give another place
i grant sweet love thy lovely argument
deserves the travail of a worthier pen
yet what of thee thy poet doth invent
he robs thee of and pays it thee again
he lends thee virtue and he stole that word
from thy behavior beauty doth he give
and found it in thy cheek he can afford
no praise to thee but what in thee doth live
 then thank him not for that which he doth say
 since what he owes thee thou thyself dost pay
lxxx
o how i faint when i of you do write
knowing a better spirit doth use your name
and in the praise thereof spends all his might
to make me tonguetied speaking of your fame
but since your worth wide as the ocean is
the humble as the proudest sail doth bear
my saucy bark inferior far to his
on your broad main doth wilfully appear
your shallowest help will hold me up afloat
whilst he upon your soundless deep doth ride
or being wreck'd i am a worthless boat
he of tall building and of goodly pride
 then if he thrive and i be cast away
 the worst was this my love was my decay
lxxxi
or i shall live your epitaph to make
or you survive when i in earth am rotten
from hence your memory death cannot take
although in me each part will be forgotten
your name from hence immortal life shall have
though i once gone to all the world must die
the earth can yield me but a common grave
when you entombed in men's eyes shall lie
your monument shall be my gentle verse
which eyes not yet created shall o'erread
and tongues to be your being shall rehearse
when all the breathers of this world are dead
 you still shall livesuch virtue hath my pen
 where breath most breathes even in the mouths of men
lxxxii
i grant thou wert not married to my muse
and therefore mayst without attaint o'erlook
the dedicated words which writers use
of their fair subject blessing every book
thou art as fair in knowledge as in hue
finding thy worth a limit past my praise
and therefore art enforced to seek anew
some fresher stamp of the timebettering days
and do so love yet when they have devised
what strained touches rhetoric can lend
thou truly fair wert truly sympathized
in true plain words by thy truetelling friend
 and their gross painting might be better used
 where cheeks need blood in thee it is abused
lxxxiii
i never saw that you did painting need
and therefore to your fair no painting set
i found or thought i found you did exceed
the barren tender of a poet's debt
and therefore have i slept in your report
that you yourself being extant well might show
how far a modern quill doth come too short
speaking of worth what worth in you doth grow
this silence for my sin you did impute
which shall be most my glory being dumb
for i impair not beauty being mute
when others would give life and bring a tomb
 there lives more life in one of your fair eyes
 than both your poets can in praise devise
lxxxiv
who is it that says most which can say more
than this rich praise that you alone are you
in whose confine immured is the store
which should example where your equal grew
lean penury within that pen doth dwell
that to his subject lends not some small glory
but he that writes of you if he can tell
that you are you so dignifies his story
let him but copy what in you is writ
not making worse what nature made so clear
and such a counterpart shall fame his wit
making his style admired every where
 you to your beauteous blessings add a curse
 being fond on praise which makes your praises worse
lxxxv
my tonguetied muse in manners holds her still
while comments of your praise richly compiled
reserve their character with golden quill
and precious phrase by all the muses filed
i think good thoughts whilst other write good words
and like unletter'd clerk still cry amen'
to every hymn that able spirit affords
in polish'd form of wellrefined pen
hearing you praised i say 'tis so tis true'
and to the most of praise add something more
but that is in my thought whose love to you
though words come hindmost holds his rank before
 then others for the breath of words respect
 me for my dumb thoughts speaking in effect
lxxxvi
was it the proud full sail of his great verse
bound for the prize of all too precious you
that did my ripe thoughts in my brain inhearse
making their tomb the womb wherein they grew
was it his spirit by spirits taught to write
above a mortal pitch that struck me dead
no neither he nor his compeers by night
giving him aid my verse astonished
he nor that affable familiar ghost
which nightly gulls him with intelligence
as victors of my silence cannot boast
i was not sick of any fear from thence
 but when your countenance fill'd up his line
 then lack'd i matter that enfeebled mine
lxxxvii
farewell thou art too dear for my possessing
and like enough thou know'st thy estimate
the charter of thy worth gives thee releasing
my bonds in thee are all determinate
for how do i hold thee but by thy granting
and for that riches where is my deserving
the cause of this fair gift in me is wanting
and so my patent back again is swerving
thyself thou gavest thy own worth then not knowing
or me to whom thou gavest it else mistaking
so thy great gift upon misprision growing
comes home again on better judgment making
 thus have i had thee as a dream doth flatter
 in sleep a king but waking no such matter
lxxxviii
