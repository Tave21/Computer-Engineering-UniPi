 your hands than mine are quicker for a fray
 my legs are longer though to run away
 exit
hermia i am amazed and know not what to say
 exit
oberon this is thy negligence still thou mistakest
 or else committ'st thy knaveries wilfully
puck believe me king of shadows i mistook
 did not you tell me i should know the man
 by the athenian garment be had on
 and so far blameless proves my enterprise
 that i have nointed an athenian's eyes
 and so far am i glad it so did sort
 as this their jangling i esteem a sport
oberon thou see'st these lovers seek a place to fight
 hie therefore robin overcast the night
 the starry welkin cover thou anon
 with drooping fog as black as acheron
 and lead these testy rivals so astray
 as one come not within another's way
 like to lysander sometime frame thy tongue
 then stir demetrius up with bitter wrong
 and sometime rail thou like demetrius
 and from each other look thou lead them thus
 till o'er their brows deathcounterfeiting sleep
 with leaden legs and batty wings doth creep
 then crush this herb into lysander's eye
 whose liquor hath this virtuous property
 to take from thence all error with his might
 and make his eyeballs roll with wonted sight
 when they next wake all this derision
 shall seem a dream and fruitless vision
 and back to athens shall the lovers wend
 with league whose date till death shall never end
 whiles i in this affair do thee employ
 i'll to my queen and beg her indian boy
 and then i will her charmed eye release
 from monster's view and all things shall be peace
puck my fairy lord this must be done with haste
 for night's swift dragons cut the clouds full fast
 and yonder shines aurora's harbinger
 at whose approach ghosts wandering here and there
 troop home to churchyards damned spirits all
 that in crossways and floods have burial
 already to their wormy beds are gone
 for fear lest day should look their shames upon
 they willfully themselves exile from light
 and must for aye consort with blackbrow'd night
oberon but we are spirits of another sort
 i with the morning's love have oft made sport
 and like a forester the groves may tread
 even till the eastern gate all fieryred
 opening on neptune with fair blessed beams
 turns into yellow gold his salt green streams
 but notwithstanding haste make no delay
 we may effect this business yet ere day
 exit
puck up and down up and down
 i will lead them up and down
 i am fear'd in field and town
 goblin lead them up and down
 here comes one
 reenter lysander
lysander where art thou proud demetrius speak thou now
puck here villain drawn and ready where art thou
lysander i will be with thee straight
puck follow me then
 to plainer ground
 exit lysander as following the voice
 reenter demetrius
demetrius lysander speak again
 thou runaway thou coward art thou fled
 speak in some bush where dost thou hide thy head
puck thou coward art thou bragging to the stars
 telling the bushes that thou look'st for wars
 and wilt not come come recreant come thou child
 i'll whip thee with a rod he is defiled
 that draws a sword on thee
demetrius yea art thou there
puck follow my voice we'll try no manhood here
 exeunt
 reenter lysander
lysander he goes before me and still dares me on
 when i come where he calls then he is gone
 the villain is much lighterheel'd than i
 i follow'd fast but faster he did fly
 that fallen am i in dark uneven way
 and here will rest me
 lies down
 come thou gentle day
 for if but once thou show me thy grey light
 i'll find demetrius and revenge this spite
 sleeps
 reenter puck and demetrius
puck ho ho ho coward why comest thou not
demetrius abide me if thou darest for well i wot
 thou runn'st before me shifting every place
 and darest not stand nor look me in the face
 where art thou now
puck come hither i am here
demetrius nay then thou mock'st me thou shalt buy this dear
 if ever i thy face by daylight see
 now go thy way faintness constraineth me
 to measure out my length on this cold bed
 by day's approach look to be visited
 lies down and sleeps
 reenter helena
helena o weary night o long and tedious night
 abate thy hour shine comforts from the east
 that i may back to athens by daylight
 from these that my poor company detest
 and sleep that sometimes shuts up sorrow's eye
 steal me awhile from mine own company
 lies down and sleeps
puck yet but three come one more
 two of both kinds make up four
 here she comes curst and sad
 cupid is a knavish lad
 thus to make poor females mad
 reenter hermia
hermia never so weary never so in woe
 bedabbled with the dew and torn with briers
 i can no further crawl no further go
 my legs can keep no pace with my desires
 here will i rest me till the break of day
 heavens shield lysander if they mean a fray
 lies down and sleeps
puck on the ground
 sleep sound
 i'll apply
 to your eye
 gentle lover remedy
 squeezing the juice on lysander's eyes
 when thou wakest
 thou takest
 true delight
 in the sight
 of thy former lady's eye
 and the country proverb known
 that every man should take his own
 in your waking shall be shown
 jack shall have jill
 nought shall go ill
 the man shall have his mare again and all shall be well

 enrings the barky fingers of the elm
