 i can no other answer make but thanks
 and thanks and ever oft good turns
 are shuffled off with such uncurrent pay
 but were my worth as is my conscience firm
 you should find better dealing what's to do
 shall we go see the reliques of this town
antonio tomorrow sir best first go see your lodging
sebastian i am not weary and tis long to night
 i pray you let us satisfy our eyes
 with the memorials and the things of fame
 that do renown this city
antonio would you'ld pardon me
 i do not without danger walk these streets
 once in a seafight gainst the count his galleys
 i did some service of such note indeed
 that were i ta'en here it would scarce be answer'd
sebastian belike you slew great number of his people
antonio the offence is not of such a bloody nature
 albeit the quality of the time and quarrel
 might well have given us bloody argument
 it might have since been answer'd in repaying
 what we took from them which for traffic's sake
 most of our city did only myself stood out
 for which if i be lapsed in this place
 i shall pay dear
sebastian do not then walk too open
antonio it doth not fit me hold sir here's my purse
 in the south suburbs at the elephant
 is best to lodge i will bespeak our diet
 whiles you beguile the time and feed your knowledge
 with viewing of the town there shall you have me
sebastian why i your purse
antonio haply your eye shall light upon some toy
 you have desire to purchase and your store
 i think is not for idle markets sir
sebastian i'll be your pursebearer and leave you
 for an hour
antonio to the elephant
sebastian i do remember
 exeunt

 appear stubborn to him for she incites me to that

 thyself into the trick of singularity and
 consequently sets down the manner how as a sad
 face a reverend carriage a slow tongue in the
 habit of some sir of note and so forth i have
 limed her but it is jove's doing and jove make me
 thankful and when she went away now let this
 fellow be looked to fellow not malvolio nor
 after my degree but fellow why every thing
 adheres together that no dram of a scruple no
 scruple of a scruple no obstacle no incredulous
 or unsafe circumstancewhat can be said nothing

 prospect of my hopes well jove not i is the
 doer of this and he is to be thanked
