they were confounded because they had hoped they came thither and were ashamed
for now ye are nothing ye see my casting down and are afraid
did i say bring unto me or give a reward for me of your substance
or deliver me from the enemy's hand or redeem me from the hand of the mighty
teach me and i will hold my tongue and cause me to understand wherein i have erred
how forcible are right words but what doth your arguing reprove
do ye imagine to reprove words and the speeches of one that is desperate which are as wind
yea ye overwhelm the fatherless and ye dig a pit for your friend
now therefore be content look upon me for it is evident unto you if i lie
return i pray you let it not be iniquity yea return again my righteousness is in it
is there iniquity in my tongue cannot my taste discern perverse things
is there not an appointed time to man upon earth are not his days also like the days of an hireling
as a servant earnestly desireth the shadow and as an hireling looketh for the reward of his work
so am i made to possess months of vanity and wearisome nights are appointed to me
when i lie down i say when shall i arise and the night be gone and i am full of tossings to and fro unto the dawning of the day
my flesh is clothed with worms and clods of dust my skin is broken and become loathsome
my days are swifter than a weaver's shuttle and are spent without hope
o remember that my life is wind mine eye shall no more see good
the eye of him that hath seen me shall see me no more thine eyes are upon me and i am not
as the cloud is consumed and vanisheth away so he that goeth down to the grave shall come up no more
he shall return no more to his house neither shall his place know him any more
therefore i will not refrain my mouth i will speak in the anguish of my spirit i will complain in the bitterness of my soul
am i a sea or a whale that thou settest a watch over me
when i say my bed shall comfort me my couch shall ease my complaint
then thou scarest me with dreams and terrifiest me through visions
so that my soul chooseth strangling and death rather than my life
i loathe it i would not live alway let me alone for my days are vanity
what is man that thou shouldest magnify him and that thou shouldest set thine heart upon him
and that thou shouldest visit him every morning and try him every moment
how long wilt thou not depart from me nor let me alone till i swallow down my spittle
i have sinned what shall i do unto thee o thou preserver of men why hast thou set me as a mark against thee so that i am a burden to myself
and why dost thou not pardon my transgression and take away mine iniquity for now shall i sleep in the dust and thou shalt seek me in the morning but i shall not be
then answered bildad the shuhite and said
how long wilt thou speak these things and how long shall the words of thy mouth be like a strong wind
doth god pervert judgment or doth the almighty pervert justice
if thy children have sinned against him and he have cast them away for their transgression
if thou wouldest seek unto god betimes and make thy supplication to the almighty
if thou wert pure and upright surely now he would awake for thee and make the habitation of thy righteousness prosperous
though thy beginning was small yet thy latter end should greatly increase
for enquire i pray thee of the former age and prepare thyself to the search of their fathers
for we are but of yesterday and know nothing because our days upon earth are a shadow
shall not they teach thee and tell thee and utter words out of their heart
can the rush grow up without mire can the flag grow without water
whilst it is yet in his greenness and not cut down it withereth before any other herb
so are the paths of all that forget god and the hypocrite's hope shall perish
whose hope shall be cut off and whose trust shall be a spider's web
he shall lean upon his house but it shall not stand he shall hold it fast but it shall not endure
he is green before the sun and his branch shooteth forth in his garden
his roots are wrapped about the heap and seeth the place of stones
if he destroy him from his place then it shall deny him saying i have not seen thee
behold this is the joy of his way and out of the earth shall others grow
behold god will not cast away a perfect man neither will he help the evil doers
till he fill thy mouth with laughing and thy lips with rejoicing
they that hate thee shall be clothed with shame and the dwelling place of the wicked shall come to nought
then job answered and said
i know it is so of a truth but how should man be just with god
if he will contend with him he cannot answer him one of a thousand
he is wise in heart and mighty in strength who hath hardened himself against him and hath prospered
which removeth the mountains and they know not which overturneth them in his anger
which shaketh the earth out of her place and the pillars thereof tremble
which commandeth the sun and it riseth not and sealeth up the stars
which alone spreadeth out the heavens and treadeth upon the waves of the sea
which maketh arcturus orion and pleiades and the chambers of the south
which doeth great things past finding out yea and wonders without number
lo he goeth by me and i see him not he passeth on also but i perceive him not
behold he taketh away who can hinder him who will say unto him what doest thou
if god will not withdraw his anger the proud helpers do stoop under him
how much less shall i answer him and choose out my words to reason with him
whom though i were righteous yet would i not answer but i would make supplication to my judge
if i had called and he had answered me yet would i not believe that he had hearkened unto my voice
for he breaketh me with a tempest and multiplieth my wounds without cause
he will not suffer me to take my breath but filleth me with bitterness
if i speak of strength lo he is strong and if of judgment who shall set me a time to plead
if i justify myself mine own mouth shall condemn me if i say i am perfect it shall also prove me perverse
though i were perfect yet would i not know my soul i would despise my life
this is one thing therefore i said it he destroyeth the perfect and the wicked
if the scourge slay suddenly he will laugh at the trial of the innocent
the earth is given into the hand of the wicked he covereth the faces of the judges thereof if not where and who is he
now my days are swifter than a post they flee away they see no good
they are passed away as the swift ships as the eagle that hasteth to the prey
if i say i will forget my complaint i will leave off my heaviness and comfort myself
i am afraid of all my sorrows i know that thou wilt not hold me innocent
if i be wicked why then labour i in vain
if i wash myself with snow water and make my hands never so clean
yet shalt thou plunge me in the ditch and mine own clothes shall abhor me
for he is not a man as i am that i should answer him and we should come together in judgment
neither is there any daysman betwixt us that might lay his hand upon us both
let him take his rod away from me and let not his fear terrify me
then would i speak and not fear him but it is not so with me
my soul is weary of my life i will leave my complaint upon myself i will speak in the bitterness of my soul
i will say unto god do not condemn me shew me wherefore thou contendest with me
is it good unto thee that thou shouldest oppress that thou shouldest despise the work of thine hands and shine upon the counsel of the wicked
hast thou eyes of flesh or seest thou as man seeth
are thy days as the days of man are thy years as man's days
that thou enquirest after mine iniquity and searchest after my sin
thou knowest that i am not wicked and there is none that can deliver out of thine hand
thine hands have made me and fashioned me together round about yet thou dost destroy me
remember i beseech thee that thou hast made me as the clay and wilt thou bring me into dust again
hast thou not poured me out as milk and curdled me like cheese
thou hast clothed me with skin and flesh and hast fenced me with bones and sinews
thou hast granted me life and favour and thy visitation hath preserved my spirit
and these things hast thou hid in thine heart i know that this is with thee
if i sin then thou markest me and thou wilt not acquit me from mine iniquity
if i be wicked woe unto me and if i be righteous yet will i not lift up my head i am full of confusion therefore see thou mine affliction
for it increaseth thou huntest me as a fierce lion and again thou shewest thyself marvellous upon me
thou renewest thy witnesses against me and increasest thine indignation upon me changes and war are against me
wherefore then hast thou brought me forth out of the womb oh that i had given up the ghost and no eye had seen me
i should have been as though i had not been i should have been carried from the womb to the grave
are not my days few cease then and let me alone that i may take comfort a little
before i go whence i shall not return even to the land of darkness and the shadow of death
a land of darkness as darkness itself and of the shadow of death without any order and where the light is as darkness
then answered zophar the naamathite and said
should not the multitude of words be answered and should a man full of talk be justified
should thy lies make men hold their peace and when thou mockest shall no man make thee ashamed
for thou hast said my doctrine is pure and i am clean in thine eyes
but oh that god would speak and open his lips against thee
and that he would shew thee the secrets of wisdom that they are double to that which is know therefore that god exacteth of thee less than thine iniquity deserveth
canst thou by searching find out god canst thou find out the almighty unto perfection
it is as high as heaven what canst thou do deeper than hell what canst thou know
the measure thereof is longer than the earth and broader than the sea
if he cut off and shut up or gather together then who can hinder him
for he knoweth vain men he seeth wickedness also will he not then consider it
for vain man would be wise though man be born like a wild ass's colt
if thou prepare thine heart and stretch out thine hands toward him
if iniquity be in thine hand put it far away and let not wickedness dwell in thy tabernacles
for then shalt thou lift up thy face without spot yea thou shalt be stedfast and shalt not fear
because thou shalt forget thy misery and remember it as waters that pass away
and thine age shall be clearer than the noonday thou shalt shine forth thou shalt be as the morning
and thou shalt be secure because there is hope yea thou shalt dig about thee and thou shalt take thy rest in safety
also thou shalt lie down and none shall make thee afraid yea many shall make suit unto thee
but the eyes of the wicked shall fail and they shall not escape and their hope shall be as the giving up of the ghost
and job answered and said
no doubt but ye are the people and wisdom shall die with you
but i have understanding as well as you i am not inferior to you yea who knoweth not such things as these
i am as one mocked of his neighbour who calleth upon god and he answereth him the just upright man is laughed to scorn
he that is ready to slip with his feet is as a lamp despised in the thought of him that is at ease
the tabernacles of robbers prosper and they that provoke god are secure into whose hand god bringeth abundantly
but ask now the beasts and they shall teach thee and the fowls of the air and they shall tell thee
or speak to the earth and it shall teach thee and the fishes of the sea shall declare unto thee
who knoweth not in all these that the hand of the lord hath wrought this
in whose hand is the soul of every living thing and the breath of all mankind
doth not the ear try words and the mouth taste his meat
with the ancient is wisdom and in length of days understanding
with him is wisdom and strength he hath counsel and understanding
behold he breaketh down and it cannot be built again he shutteth up a man and there can be no opening
behold he withholdeth the waters and they dry up also he sendeth them out and they overturn the earth
with him is strength and wisdom the deceived and the deceiver are his
he leadeth counsellors away spoiled and maketh the judges fools
he looseth the bond of kings and girdeth their loins with a girdle
he leadeth princes away spoiled and overthroweth the mighty
he removeth away the speech of the trusty and taketh away the understanding of the aged
he poureth contempt upon princes and weakeneth the strength of the mighty
he discovereth deep things out of darkness and bringeth out to light the shadow of death
he increaseth the nations and destroyeth them he enlargeth the nations and straiteneth them again
he taketh away the heart of the chief of the people of the earth and causeth them to wander in a wilderness where there is no way
they grope in the dark without light and he maketh them to stagger like a drunken man
lo mine eye hath seen all this mine ear hath heard and understood it
what ye know the same do i know also i am not inferior unto you
surely i would speak to the almighty and i desire to reason with god
but ye are forgers of lies ye are all physicians of no value
o that ye would altogether hold your peace and it should be your wisdom
hear now my reasoning and hearken to the pleadings of my lips
will ye speak wickedly for god and talk deceitfully for him
will ye accept his person will ye contend for god
is it good that he should search you out or as one man mocketh another do ye so mock him
he will surely reprove you if ye do secretly accept persons
shall not his excellency make you afraid and his dread fall upon you
your remembrances are like unto ashes your bodies to bodies of clay
hold your peace let me alone that i may speak and let come on me what will
wherefore do i take my flesh in my teeth and put my life in mine hand
though he slay me yet will i trust in him but i will maintain mine own ways before him
he also shall be my salvation for an hypocrite shall not come before him
hear diligently my speech and my declaration with your ears
behold now i have ordered my cause i know that i shall be justified
who is he that will plead with me for now if i hold my tongue i shall give up the ghost
only do not two things unto me then will i not hide myself from thee
withdraw thine hand far from me and let not thy dread make me afraid
then call thou and i will answer or let me speak and answer thou me
how many are mine iniquities and sins make me to know my transgression and my sin
wherefore hidest thou thy face and holdest me for thine enemy
wilt thou break a leaf driven to and fro and wilt thou pursue the dry stubble
for thou writest bitter things against me and makest me to possess the iniquities of my youth
thou puttest my feet also in the stocks and lookest narrowly unto all my paths thou settest a print upon the heels of my feet
and he as a rotten thing consumeth as a garment that is moth eaten
man that is born of a woman is of few days and full of trouble
he cometh forth like a flower and is cut down he fleeth also as a shadow and continueth not
and dost thou open thine eyes upon such an one and bringest me into judgment with thee
who can bring a clean thing out of an unclean not one
seeing his days are determined the number of his months are with thee thou hast appointed his bounds that he cannot pass
turn from him that he may rest till he shall accomplish as an hireling his day
for there is hope of a tree if it be cut down that it will sprout again and that the tender branch thereof will not cease
though the root thereof wax old in the earth and the stock thereof die in the ground
yet through the scent of water it will bud and bring forth boughs like a plant
but man dieth and wasteth away yea man giveth up the ghost and where is he
as the waters fail from the sea and the flood decayeth and drieth up
so man lieth down and riseth not till the heavens be no more they shall not awake nor be raised out of their sleep
o that thou wouldest hide me in the grave that thou wouldest keep me secret until thy wrath be past that thou wouldest appoint me a set time and remember me
if a man die shall he live again all the days of my appointed time will i wait till my change come
thou shalt call and i will answer thee thou wilt have a desire to the work of thine hands
for now thou numberest my steps dost thou not watch over my sin
