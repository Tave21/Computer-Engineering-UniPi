 exit guardsman
 what poor an instrument
 may do a noble deed he brings me liberty
 my resolution's placed and i have nothing
 of woman in me now from head to foot
 i am marbleconstant now the fleeting moon
 no planet is of mine
 reenter guardsman with clown bringing in a basket
guard this is the man
cleopatra avoid and leave him
 exit guardsman
 hast thou the pretty worm of nilus there
 that kills and pains not
clown truly i have him but i would not be the party
 that should desire you to touch him for his biting
 is immortal those that do die of it do seldom or
 never recover
cleopatra rememberest thou any that have died on't
clown very many men and women too i heard of one of
 them no longer than yesterday a very honest woman
 but something given to lie as a woman should not
 do but in the way of honesty how she died of the
 biting of it what pain she felt truly she makes
 a very good report o the worm but he that will
 believe all that they say shall never be saved by
 half that they do but this is most fallible the
 worm's an odd worm
cleopatra get thee hence farewell
clown i wish you all joy of the worm
 setting down his basket
cleopatra farewell
clown you must think this look you that the worm will
 do his kind
cleopatra ay ay farewell
clown look you the worm is not to be trusted but in the
 keeping of wise people for indeed there is no
 goodness in worm
cleopatra take thou no care it shall be heeded
clown very good give it nothing i pray you for it is
 not worth the feeding
cleopatra will it eat me
clown you must not think i am so simple but i know the
 devil himself will not eat a woman i know that a
 woman is a dish for the gods if the devil dress her
 not but truly these same whoreson devils do the
 gods great harm in their women for in every ten
 that they make the devils mar five
cleopatra well get thee gone farewell
clown yes forsooth i wish you joy o the worm
 exit
 reenter iras with a robe crown &c
cleopatra give me my robe put on my crown i have
 immortal longings in me now no more
 the juice of egypt's grape shall moist this lip
 yare yare good iras quick methinks i hear
 antony call i see him rouse himself
 to praise my noble act i hear him mock
 the luck of caesar which the gods give men
 to excuse their after wrath husband i come
 now to that name my courage prove my title
 i am fire and air my other elements
 i give to baser life so have you done
 come then and take the last warmth of my lips
 farewell kind charmian iras long farewell
 kisses them iras falls and dies
 have i the aspic in my lips dost fall
 if thou and nature can so gently part
 the stroke of death is as a lover's pinch
 which hurts and is desired dost thou lie still
 if thus thou vanishest thou tell'st the world
 it is not worth leavetaking
charmian dissolve thick cloud and rain that i may say
 the gods themselves do weep
cleopatra this proves me base
 if she first meet the curled antony
 he'll make demand of her and spend that kiss
 which is my heaven to have come thou
 mortal wretch
 to an asp which she applies to her breast
 with thy sharp teeth this knot intrinsicate
 of life at once untie poor venomous fool
 be angry and dispatch o couldst thou speak
 that i might hear thee call great caesar ass
 unpolicied
charmian o eastern star
cleopatra peace peace
 dost thou not see my baby at my breast
 that sucks the nurse asleep
charmian o break o break
cleopatra as sweet as balm as soft as air as gentle
 o antonynay i will take thee too
 applying another asp to her arm
 what should i stay
 dies
charmian in this vile world so fare thee well
 now boast thee death in thy possession lies
 a lass unparallel'd downy windows close
 and golden phoebus never be beheld
 of eyes again so royal your crown's awry
 i'll mend it and then play
 enter the guard rushing in
first guard where is the queen
charmian speak softly wake her not
first guard caesar hath sent
charmian too slow a messenger
 applies an asp
 o come apace dispatch i partly feel thee
first guard approach ho all's not well caesar's beguiled
second guard there's dolabella sent from caesar call him
first guard what work is here charmian is this well done
charmian it is well done and fitting for a princess
 descended of so many royal kings
 ah soldier
 dies
 reenter dolabella
dolabella how goes it here
second guard all dead
dolabella caesar thy thoughts
 touch their effects in this thyself art coming
 to see perform'd the dreaded act which thou
 so sought'st to hinder
 within a way there a way for caesar'
 reenter octavius caesar and all his train marching
dolabella o sir you are too sure an augurer
 that you did fear is done
octavius caesar bravest at the last
 she levell'd at our purposes and being royal
 took her own way the manner of their deaths
 i do not see them bleed
dolabella who was last with them
first guard a simple countryman that brought her figs
 this was his basket
octavius caesar poison'd then
first guard o caesar
 this charmian lived but now she stood and spake
 i found her trimming up the diadem
 on her dead mistress tremblingly she stood
 and on the sudden dropp'd
octavius caesar o noble weakness
 if they had swallow'd poison twould appear
 by external swelling but she looks like sleep
 as she would catch another antony
 in her strong toil of grace
dolabella here on her breast
 there is a vent of blood and something blown
 the like is on her arm
first guard this is an aspic's trail and these figleaves
 have slime upon them such as the aspic leaves
 upon the caves of nile
octavius caesar most probable
 that so she died for her physician tells me
 she hath pursued conclusions infinite
 of easy ways to die take up her bed
 and bear her women from the monument
 she shall be buried by her antony
 no grave upon the earth shall clip in it
 a pair so famous high events as these
 strike those that make them and their story is
 no less in pity than his glory which
 brought them to be lamented our army shall
 in solemn show attend this funeral
 and then to rome come dolabella see
 high order in this great solemnity
