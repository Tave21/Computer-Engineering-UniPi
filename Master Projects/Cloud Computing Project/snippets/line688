 and wet my cheeks with artificial tears
 and frame my face to all occasions
 i'll drown more sailors than the mermaid shall
 i'll slay more gazers than the basilisk
 i'll play the orator as well as nestor
 deceive more slily than ulysses could
 and like a sinon take another troy
 i can add colours to the chameleon
 change shapes with proteus for advantages
 and set the murderous machiavel to school
 can i do this and cannot get a crown
 tut were it farther off i'll pluck it down

 3 king henry vi
act iii
scene iii france king lewis xi's palace
 flourish enter king lewis xi his sister bona
 his admiral called bourbon prince edward queen
 margaret and oxford king lewis xi sits and
 riseth up again
king lewis xi fair queen of england worthy margaret
 sit down with us it ill befits thy state
 and birth that thou shouldst stand while lewis doth sit
queen margaret no mighty king of france now margaret
 must strike her sail and learn awhile to serve
 where kings command i was i must confess
 great albion's queen in former golden days
 but now mischance hath trod my title down
 and with dishonour laid me on the ground
 where i must take like seat unto my fortune
 and to my humble seat conform myself
king lewis xi why say fair queen whence springs this deep despair
queen margaret from such a cause as fills mine eyes with tears
 and stops my tongue while heart is drown'd in cares
king lewis xi whate'er it be be thou still like thyself
 and sit thee by our side
 seats her by him
 yield not thy neck
 to fortune's yoke but let thy dauntless mind
 still ride in triumph over all mischance
 be plain queen margaret and tell thy grief
 it shall be eased if france can yield relief
queen margaret those gracious words revive my drooping thoughts
 and give my tonguetied sorrows leave to speak
 now therefore be it known to noble lewis
 that henry sole possessor of my love
 is of a king become a banish'd man
 and forced to live in scotland a forlorn
 while proud ambitious edward duke of york
 usurps the regal title and the seat
 of england's trueanointed lawful king
 this is the cause that i poor margaret
 with this my son prince edward henry's heir
 am come to crave thy just and lawful aid
 and if thou fail us all our hope is done
 scotland hath will to help but cannot help
 our people and our peers are both misled
 our treasures seized our soldiers put to flight
 and as thou seest ourselves in heavy plight
king lewis xi renowned queen with patience calm the storm
 while we bethink a means to break it off
queen margaret the more we stay the stronger grows our foe
king lewis xi the more i stay the more i'll succor thee
queen margaret o but impatience waiteth on true sorrow
 and see where comes the breeder of my sorrow
 enter warwick
king lewis xi what's he approacheth boldly to our presence
queen margaret our earl of warwick edward's greatest friend
king lewis xi welcome brave warwick what brings thee to france
 he descends she ariseth
queen margaret ay now begins a second storm to rise
 for this is he that moves both wind and tide
warwick from worthy edward king of albion
 my lord and sovereign and thy vowed friend
 i come in kindness and unfeigned love
 first to do greetings to thy royal person
 and then to crave a league of amity
 and lastly to confirm that amity
 with a nuptial knot if thou vouchsafe to grant
 that virtuous lady bona thy fair sister
 to england's king in lawful marriage
queen margaret aside if that go forward henry's hope is done
warwick to bona and gracious madam in our king's behalf
 i am commanded with your leave and favour
 humbly to kiss your hand and with my tongue
 to tell the passion of my sovereign's heart
 where fame late entering at his heedful ears
 hath placed thy beauty's image and thy virtue
queen margaret king lewis and lady bona hear me speak
 before you answer warwick his demand
 springs not from edward's wellmeant honest love
 but from deceit bred by necessity
 for how can tyrants safely govern home
 unless abroad they purchase great alliance
 to prove him tyrant this reason may suffice
 that henry liveth still but were he dead
 yet here prince edward stands king henry's son
 look therefore lewis that by this league and marriage
 thou draw not on thy danger and dishonour
 for though usurpers sway the rule awhile
 yet heavens are just and time suppresseth wrongs
warwick injurious margaret
prince edward and why not queen
warwick because thy father henry did usurp
 and thou no more are prince than she is queen
oxford then warwick disannuls great john of gaunt
 which did subdue the greatest part of spain
 and after john of gaunt henry the fourth
 whose wisdom was a mirror to the wisest
 and after that wise prince henry the fifth
 who by his prowess conquered all france
 from these our henry lineally descends
warwick oxford how haps it in this smooth discourse
 you told not how henry the sixth hath lost
 all that which henry fifth had gotten
 methinks these peers of france should smile at that
 but for the rest you tell a pedigree
 of threescore and two years a silly time
 to make prescription for a kingdom's worth
oxford why warwick canst thou speak against thy liege
 whom thou obeyed'st thirty and six years
 and not bewray thy treason with a blush
warwick can oxford that did ever fence the right
 now buckler falsehood with a pedigree
 for shame leave henry and call edward king
oxford call him my king by whose injurious doom
 my elder brother the lord aubrey vere
 was done to death and more than so my father
 even in the downfall of his mellow'd years
 when nature brought him to the door of death
 no warwick no while life upholds this arm
 this arm upholds the house of lancaster
warwick and i the house of york
king lewis xi queen margaret prince edward and oxford
 vouchsafe at our request to stand aside
 while i use further conference with warwick
 they stand aloof
queen margaret heavens grant that warwick's words bewitch him not
king lewis xi now warwick tell me even upon thy conscience
 is edward your true king for i were loath
 to link with him that were not lawful chosen
warwick thereon i pawn my credit and mine honour
king lewis xi but is he gracious in the people's eye
warwick the more that henry was unfortunate
king lewis xi then further all dissembling set aside
 tell me for truth the measure of his love
 unto our sister bona
warwick such it seems
 as may beseem a monarch like himself
 myself have often heard him say and swear
 that this his love was an eternal plant
 whereof the root was fix'd in virtue's ground
 the leaves and fruit maintain'd with beauty's sun
 exempt from envy but not from disdain
 unless the lady bona quit his pain
king lewis xi now sister let us hear your firm resolve
bona your grant or your denial shall be mine
 to warwick
 yet i confess that often ere this day
 when i have heard your king's desert recounted
 mine ear hath tempted judgment to desire
king lewis xi then warwick thus our sister shall be edward's
 and now forthwith shall articles be drawn
 touching the jointure that your king must make
 which with her dowry shall be counterpoised
 draw near queen margaret and be a witness
 that bona shall be wife to the english king
prince edward to edward but not to the english king
queen margaret deceitful warwick it was thy device
 by this alliance to make void my suit
 before thy coming lewis was henry's friend
king lewis xi and still is friend to him and margaret
 but if your title to the crown be weak
 as may appear by edward's good success
 then tis but reason that i be released
 from giving aid which late i promised
 yet shall you have all kindness at my hand
 that your estate requires and mine can yield
warwick henry now lives in scotland at his ease
 where having nothing nothing can he lose
 and as for you yourself our quondam queen
 you have a father able to maintain you
 and better twere you troubled him than france
queen margaret peace impudent and shameless warwick peace
 proud setter up and puller down of kings
 i will not hence till with my talk and tears
 both full of truth i make king lewis behold
 thy sly conveyance and thy lord's false love
 for both of you are birds of selfsame feather
 post blows a horn within
king lewis xi warwick this is some post to us or thee
 enter a post
post to warwick my lord ambassador these letters are for you
 sent from your brother marquess montague
 to king lewis xi
 these from our king unto your majesty
 to queen margaret
 and madam these for you from whom i know not
 they all read their letters
oxford i like it well that our fair queen and mistress
