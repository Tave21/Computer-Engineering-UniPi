'yet die i will not till my collatine
have heard the cause of my untimely death
that he may vow in that sad hour of mine
revenge on him that made me stop my breath
my stained blood to tarquin i'll bequeath
which by him tainted shall for him be spent
and as his due writ in my testament
'my honour i'll bequeath unto the knife
that wounds my body so dishonoured
'tis honour to deprive dishonour'd life
the one will live the other being dead
so of shame's ashes shall my fame be bred
for in my death i murder shameful scorn
my shame so dead mine honour is newborn
'dear lord of that dear jewel i have lost
what legacy shall i bequeath to thee
my resolution love shall be thy boast
by whose example thou revenged mayest be
how tarquin must be used read it in me
myself thy friend will kill myself thy foe
and for my sake serve thou false tarquin so
'this brief abridgement of my will i make
my soul and body to the skies and ground
my resolution husband do thou take
mine honour be the knife's that makes my wound
my shame be his that did my fame confound
and all my fame that lives disbursed be
to those that live and think no shame of me
'thou collatine shalt oversee this will
how was i overseen that thou shalt see it
my blood shall wash the slander of mine ill
my life's foul deed my life's fair end shall free it
faint not faint heart but stoutly say so be it'
yield to my hand my hand shall conquer thee
thou dead both die and both shall victors be'
this plot of death when sadly she had laid
and wiped the brinish pearl from her bright eyes
with untuned tongue she hoarsely calls her maid
whose swift obedience to her mistress hies
for fleetwing'd duty with thought's feathers flies
poor lucrece cheeks unto her maid seem so
as winter meads when sun doth melt their snow
her mistress she doth give demure goodmorrow
with softslow tongue true mark of modesty
and sorts a sad look to her lady's sorrow
for why her face wore sorrow's livery
but durst not ask of her audaciously
why her two suns were cloudeclipsed so
nor why her fair cheeks overwash'd with woe
but as the earth doth weep the sun being set
each flower moisten'd like a melting eye
even so the maid with swelling drops gan wet
her circled eyne enforced by sympathy
of those fair suns set in her mistress sky
who in a saltwaved ocean quench their light
which makes the maid weep like the dewy night
a pretty while these pretty creatures stand
like ivory conduits coral cisterns filling
one justly weeps the other takes in hand
no cause but company of her drops spilling
their gentle sex to weep are often willing
grieving themselves to guess at others smarts
and then they drown their eyes or break their hearts
for men have marble women waxen minds
and therefore are they form'd as marble will
the weak oppress'd the impression of strange kinds
is form'd in them by force by fraud or skill
then call them not the authors of their ill
no more than wax shall be accounted evil
wherein is stamp'd the semblance of a devil
their smoothness like a goodly champaign plain
lays open all the little worms that creep
in men as in a roughgrown grove remain
cavekeeping evils that obscurely sleep
through crystal walls each little mote will peep
though men can cover crimes with bold stern looks
poor women's faces are their own fault's books
no man inveigh against the wither'd flower
but chide rough winter that the flower hath kill'd
not that devour'd but that which doth devour
is worthy blame o let it not be hild
poor women's faults that they are so fulfill'd
with men's abuses those proud lords to blame
make weakmade women tenants to their shame
the precedent whereof in lucrece view
assail'd by night with circumstances strong
of present death and shame that might ensue
by that her death to do her husband wrong
such danger to resistance did belong
that dying fear through all her body spread
and who cannot abuse a body dead
by this mild patience bid fair lucrece speak
to the poor counterfeit of her complaining
'my girl quoth she on what occasion break
those tears from thee that down thy cheeks are
raining
if thou dost weep for grief of my sustaining
know gentle wench it small avails my mood
if tears could help mine own would do me good
'but tell me girl when went'and there she stay'd
till after a deep groan'tarquin from hence'
'madam ere i was up replied the maid
'the more to blame my sluggard negligence
yet with the fault i thus far can dispense
myself was stirring ere the break of day
and ere i rose was tarquin gone away
'but lady if your maid may be so bold
she would request to know your heaviness'
'o peace quoth lucrece if it should be told
the repetition cannot make it less
for more it is than i can well express
and that deep torture may be call'd a hell
when more is felt than one hath power to tell
'go get me hither paper ink and pen
yet save that labour for i have them here
what should i say one of my husband's men
bid thou be ready by and by to bear
a letter to my lord my love my dear
bid him with speed prepare to carry it
the cause craves haste and it will soon be writ'
her maid is gone and she prepares to write
first hovering o'er the paper with her quill
conceit and grief an eager combat fight
what wit sets down is blotted straight with will
this is too curiousgood this blunt and ill
much like a press of people at a door
throng her inventions which shall go before
at last she thus begins thou worthy lord
of that unworthy wife that greeteth thee
health to thy person next vouchsafe t afford
if ever love thy lucrece thou wilt see
some present speed to come and visit me
so i commend me from our house in grief
my woes are tedious though my words are brief'
here folds she up the tenor of her woe
her certain sorrow writ uncertainly
by this short schedule collatine may know
her grief but not her grief's true quality
she dares not thereof make discovery
lest he should hold it her own gross abuse
ere she with blood had stain'd her stain'd excuse
besides the life and feeling of her passion
she hoards to spend when he is by to hear her
when sighs and groans and tears may grace the fashion
of her disgrace the better so to clear her
from that suspicion which the world might bear her
to shun this blot she would not blot the letter
with words till action might become them better
to see sad sights moves more than hear them told
for then eye interprets to the ear
the heavy motion that it doth behold
when every part a part of woe doth bear
'tis but a part of sorrow that we hear
deep sounds make lesser noise than shallow fords
and sorrow ebbs being blown with wind of words
her letter now is seal'd and on it writ
'at ardea to my lord with more than haste'
the post attends and she delivers it
charging the sourfaced groom to hie as fast
as lagging fowls before the northern blast
speed more than speed but dull and slow she deems
extremity still urgeth such extremes
the homely villain court'sies to her low
and blushing on her with a steadfast eye
receives the scroll without or yea or no
and forth with bashful innocence doth hie
but they whose guilt within their bosoms lie
imagine every eye beholds their blame
for lucrece thought he blush'd to her see shame
when silly groom god wot it was defect
of spirit life and bold audacity
such harmless creatures have a true respect
to talk in deeds while others saucily
promise more speed but do it leisurely
even so this pattern of the wornout age
pawn'd honest looks but laid no words to gage
his kindled duty kindled her mistrust
that two red fires in both their faces blazed
she thought he blush'd as knowing tarquin's lust
and blushing with him wistly on him gazed
her earnest eye did make him more amazed
the more she saw the blood his cheeks replenish
the more she thought he spied in her some blemish
but long she thinks till he return again
and yet the duteous vassal scarce is gone
the weary time she cannot entertain
for now tis stale to sigh to weep and groan
so woe hath wearied woe moan tired moan
that she her plaints a little while doth stay
pausing for means to mourn some newer way
at last she calls to mind where hangs a piece
of skilful painting made for priam's troy
before the which is drawn the power of greece
for helen's rape the city to destroy
threatening cloudkissing ilion with annoy
which the conceited painter drew so proud
as heaven it seem'd to kiss the turrets bow'd
a thousand lamentable objects there
in scorn of nature art gave lifeless life
many a dry drop seem'd a weeping tear
