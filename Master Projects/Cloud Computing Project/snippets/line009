and the lord said unto moses stretch out thine hand toward heaven that there may be darkness over the land of egypt even darkness which may be felt
and moses stretched forth his hand toward heaven and there was a thick darkness in all the land of egypt three days
they saw not one another neither rose any from his place for three days but all the children of israel had light in their dwellings
and pharaoh called unto moses and said go ye serve the lord only let your flocks and your herds be stayed let your little ones also go with you
and moses said thou must give us also sacrifices and burnt offerings that we may sacrifice unto the lord our god
our cattle also shall go with us there shall not an hoof be left behind for thereof must we take to serve the lord our god and we know not with what we must serve the lord until we come thither
but the lord hardened pharaoh's heart and he would not let them go
and pharaoh said unto him get thee from me take heed to thyself see my face no more for in that day thou seest my face thou shalt die
and moses said thou hast spoken well i will see thy face again no more
and the lord said unto moses yet will i bring one plague more upon pharaoh and upon egypt afterwards he will let you go hence when he shall let you go he shall surely thrust you out hence altogether
speak now in the ears of the people and let every man borrow of his neighbour and every woman of her neighbour jewels of silver and jewels of gold
and the lord gave the people favour in the sight of the egyptians moreover the man moses was very great in the land of egypt in the sight of pharaoh's servants and in the sight of the people
and moses said thus saith the lord about midnight will i go out into the midst of egypt
and all the firstborn in the land of egypt shall die from the first born of pharaoh that sitteth upon his throne even unto the firstborn of the maidservant that is behind the mill and all the firstborn of beasts
and there shall be a great cry throughout all the land of egypt such as there was none like it nor shall be like it any more
but against any of the children of israel shall not a dog move his tongue against man or beast that ye may know how that the lord doth put a difference between the egyptians and israel
and all these thy servants shall come down unto me and bow down themselves unto me saying get thee out and all the people that follow thee and after that i will go out and he went out from pharaoh in a great anger
and the lord said unto moses pharaoh shall not hearken unto you that my wonders may be multiplied in the land of egypt
and moses and aaron did all these wonders before pharaoh and the lord hardened pharaoh's heart so that he would not let the children of israel go out of his land
and the lord spake unto moses and aaron in the land of egypt saying
this month shall be unto you the beginning of months it shall be the first month of the year to you
speak ye unto all the congregation of israel saying in the tenth day of this month they shall take to them every man a lamb according to the house of their fathers a lamb for an house
and if the household be too little for the lamb let him and his neighbour next unto his house take it according to the number of the souls every man according to his eating shall make your count for the lamb
your lamb shall be without blemish a male of the first year ye shall take it out from the sheep or from the goats
and ye shall keep it up until the fourteenth day of the same month and the whole assembly of the congregation of israel shall kill it in the evening
and they shall take of the blood and strike it on the two side posts and on the upper door post of the houses wherein they shall eat it
and they shall eat the flesh in that night roast with fire and unleavened bread and with bitter herbs they shall eat it
eat not of it raw nor sodden at all with water but roast with fire his head with his legs and with the purtenance thereof
and ye shall let nothing of it remain until the morning and that which remaineth of it until the morning ye shall burn with fire
and thus shall ye eat it with your loins girded your shoes on your feet and your staff in your hand and ye shall eat it in haste it is the lord's passover
for i will pass through the land of egypt this night and will smite all the firstborn in the land of egypt both man and beast and against all the gods of egypt i will execute judgment i am the lord
and the blood shall be to you for a token upon the houses where ye are and when i see the blood i will pass over you and the plague shall not be upon you to destroy you when i smite the land of egypt
and this day shall be unto you for a memorial and ye shall keep it a feast to the lord throughout your generations ye shall keep it a feast by an ordinance for ever
seven days shall ye eat unleavened bread even the first day ye shall put away leaven out of your houses for whosoever eateth leavened bread from the first day until the seventh day that soul shall be cut off from israel
and in the first day there shall be an holy convocation and in the seventh day there shall be an holy convocation to you no manner of work shall be done in them save that which every man must eat that only may be done of you
and ye shall observe the feast of unleavened bread for in this selfsame day have i brought your armies out of the land of egypt therefore shall ye observe this day in your generations by an ordinance for ever
in the first month on the fourteenth day of the month at even ye shall eat unleavened bread until the one and twentieth day of the month at even
seven days shall there be no leaven found in your houses for whosoever eateth that which is leavened even that soul shall be cut off from the congregation of israel whether he be a stranger or born in the land
ye shall eat nothing leavened in all your habitations shall ye eat unleavened bread
then moses called for all the elders of israel and said unto them draw out and take you a lamb according to your families and kill the passover
and ye shall take a bunch of hyssop and dip it in the blood that is in the bason and strike the lintel and the two side posts with the blood that is in the bason and none of you shall go out at the door of his house until the morning
for the lord will pass through to smite the egyptians and when he seeth the blood upon the lintel and on the two side posts the lord will pass over the door and will not suffer the destroyer to come in unto your houses to smite you
and ye shall observe this thing for an ordinance to thee and to thy sons for ever
and it shall come to pass when ye be come to the land which the lord will give you according as he hath promised that ye shall keep this service
and it shall come to pass when your children shall say unto you what mean ye by this service
that ye shall say it is the sacrifice of the lord's passover who passed over the houses of the children of israel in egypt when he smote the egyptians and delivered our houses and the people bowed the head and worshipped
and the children of israel went away and did as the lord had commanded moses and aaron so did they
and it came to pass that at midnight the lord smote all the firstborn in the land of egypt from the firstborn of pharaoh that sat on his throne unto the firstborn of the captive that was in the dungeon and all the firstborn of cattle
and pharaoh rose up in the night he and all his servants and all the egyptians and there was a great cry in egypt for there was not a house where there was not one dead
and he called for moses and aaron by night and said rise up and get you forth from among my people both ye and the children of israel and go serve the lord as ye have said
also take your flocks and your herds as ye have said and be gone and bless me also
and the egyptians were urgent upon the people that they might send them out of the land in haste for they said we be all dead men
and the people took their dough before it was leavened their kneadingtroughs being bound up in their clothes upon their shoulders
and the children of israel did according to the word of moses and they borrowed of the egyptians jewels of silver and jewels of gold and raiment
and the lord gave the people favour in the sight of the egyptians so that they lent unto them such things as they required and they spoiled the egyptians
and the children of israel journeyed from rameses to succoth about six hundred thousand on foot that were men beside children
and a mixed multitude went up also with them and flocks and herds even very much cattle
and they baked unleavened cakes of the dough which they brought forth out of egypt for it was not leavened because they were thrust out of egypt and could not tarry neither had they prepared for themselves any victual
now the sojourning of the children of israel who dwelt in egypt was four hundred and thirty years
and it came to pass at the end of the four hundred and thirty years even the selfsame day it came to pass that all the hosts of the lord went out from the land of egypt
it is a night to be much observed unto the lord for bringing them out from the land of egypt this is that night of the lord to be observed of all the children of israel in their generations
and the lord said unto moses and aaron this is the ordinance of the passover there shall no stranger eat thereof
but every man's servant that is bought for money when thou hast circumcised him then shall he eat thereof
a foreigner and an hired servant shall not eat thereof
in one house shall it be eaten thou shalt not carry forth ought of the flesh abroad out of the house neither shall ye break a bone thereof
all the congregation of israel shall keep it
and when a stranger shall sojourn with thee and will keep the passover to the lord let all his males be circumcised and then let him come near and keep it and he shall be as one that is born in the land for no uncircumcised person shall eat thereof
one law shall be to him that is homeborn and unto the stranger that sojourneth among you
thus did all the children of israel as the lord commanded moses and aaron so did they
and it came to pass the selfsame day that the lord did bring the children of israel out of the land of egypt by their armies
and the lord spake unto moses saying
sanctify unto me all the firstborn whatsoever openeth the womb among the children of israel both of man and of beast it is mine
and moses said unto the people remember this day in which ye came out from egypt out of the house of bondage for by strength of hand the lord brought you out from this place there shall no leavened bread be eaten
this day came ye out in the month abib
and it shall be when the lord shall bring thee into the land of the canaanites and the hittites and the amorites and the hivites and the jebusites which he sware unto thy fathers to give thee a land flowing with milk and honey that thou shalt keep this service in this month
seven days thou shalt eat unleavened bread and in the seventh day shall be a feast to the lord
unleavened bread shall be eaten seven days and there shall no leavened bread be seen with thee neither shall there be leaven seen with thee in all thy quarters
and thou shalt shew thy son in that day saying this is done because of that which the lord did unto me when i came forth out of egypt
and it shall be for a sign unto thee upon thine hand and for a memorial between thine eyes that the lord's law may be in thy mouth for with a strong hand hath the lord brought thee out of egypt
thou shalt therefore keep this ordinance in his season from year to year
and it shall be when the lord shall bring thee into the land of the canaanites as he sware unto thee and to thy fathers and shall give it thee
that thou shalt set apart unto the lord all that openeth the matrix and every firstling that cometh of a beast which thou hast the males shall be the lord's
and every firstling of an ass thou shalt redeem with a lamb and if thou wilt not redeem it then thou shalt break his neck and all the firstborn of man among thy children shalt thou redeem
and it shall be when thy son asketh thee in time to come saying what is this that thou shalt say unto him by strength of hand the lord brought us out from egypt from the house of bondage
and it came to pass when pharaoh would hardly let us go that the lord slew all the firstborn in the land of egypt both the firstborn of man and the firstborn of beast therefore i sacrifice to the lord all that openeth the matrix being males but all the firstborn of my children i redeem
and it shall be for a token upon thine hand and for frontlets between thine eyes for by strength of hand the lord brought us forth out of egypt
and it came to pass when pharaoh had let the people go that god led them not through the way of the land of the philistines although that was near for god said lest peradventure the people repent when they see war and they return to egypt
but god led the people about through the way of the wilderness of the red sea and the children of israel went up harnessed out of the land of egypt
and moses took the bones of joseph with him for he had straitly sworn the children of israel saying god will surely visit you and ye shall carry up my bones away hence with you
and they took their journey from succoth and encamped in etham in the edge of the wilderness
and the lord went before them by day in a pillar of a cloud to lead them the way and by night in a pillar of fire to give them light to go by day and night
he took not away the pillar of the cloud by day nor the pillar of fire by night from before the people
and the lord spake unto moses saying
speak unto the children of israel that they turn and encamp before pihahiroth between migdol and the sea over against baalzephon before it shall ye encamp by the sea
for pharaoh will say of the children of israel they are entangled in the land the wilderness hath shut them in
and i will harden pharaoh's heart that he shall follow after them and i will be honoured upon pharaoh and upon all his host that the egyptians may know that i am the lord and they did so
and it was told the king of egypt that the people fled and the heart of pharaoh and of his servants was turned against the people and they said why have we done this that we have let israel go from serving us
and he made ready his chariot and took his people with him
and he took six hundred chosen chariots and all the chariots of egypt and captains over every one of them
and the lord hardened the heart of pharaoh king of egypt and he pursued after the children of israel and the children of israel went out with an high hand
but the egyptians pursued after them all the horses and chariots of pharaoh and his horsemen and his army and overtook them encamping by the sea beside pihahiroth before baalzephon
and when pharaoh drew nigh the children of israel lifted up their eyes and behold the egyptians marched after them and they were sore afraid and the children of israel cried out unto the lord
and they said unto moses because there were no graves in egypt hast thou taken us away to die in the wilderness wherefore hast thou dealt thus with us to carry us forth out of egypt
is not this the word that we did tell thee in egypt saying let us alone that we may serve the egyptians for it had been better for us to serve the egyptians than that we should die in the wilderness
and moses said unto the people fear ye not stand still and see the salvation of the lord which he will shew to you to day for the egyptians whom ye have seen to day ye shall see them again no more for ever
the lord shall fight for you and ye shall hold your peace
and the lord said unto moses wherefore criest thou unto me speak unto the children of israel that they go forward
but lift thou up thy rod and stretch out thine hand over the sea and divide it and the children of israel shall go on dry ground through the midst of the sea
and i behold i will harden the hearts of the egyptians and they shall follow them and i will get me honour upon pharaoh and upon all his host upon his chariots and upon his horsemen
and the egyptians shall know that i am the lord when i have gotten me honour upon pharaoh upon his chariots and upon his horsemen
and the angel of god which went before the camp of israel removed and went behind them and the pillar of the cloud went from before their face and stood behind them
and it came between the camp of the egyptians and the camp of israel and it was a cloud and darkness to them but it gave light by night to these so that the one came not near the other all the night
and moses stretched out his hand over the sea and the lord caused the sea to go back by a strong east wind all that night and made the sea dry land and the waters were divided
and the children of israel went into the midst of the sea upon the dry ground and the waters were a wall unto them on their right hand and on their left
and the egyptians pursued and went in after them to the midst of the sea even all pharaoh's horses his chariots and his horsemen
and it came to pass that in the morning watch the lord looked unto the host of the egyptians through the pillar of fire and of the cloud and troubled the host of the egyptians
and took off their chariot wheels that they drave them heavily so that the egyptians said let us flee from the face of israel for the lord fighteth for them against the egyptians
and the lord said unto moses stretch out thine hand over the sea that the waters may come again upon the egyptians upon their chariots and upon their horsemen
and moses stretched forth his hand over the sea and the sea returned to his strength when the morning appeared and the egyptians fled against it and the lord overthrew the egyptians in the midst of the sea
and the waters returned and covered the chariots and the horsemen and all the host of pharaoh that came into the sea after them there remained not so much as one of them
but the children of israel walked upon dry land in the midst of the sea and the waters were a wall unto them on their right hand and on their left
thus the lord saved israel that day out of the hand of the egyptians and israel saw the egyptians dead upon the sea shore
and israel saw that great work which the lord did upon the egyptians and the people feared the lord and believed the lord and his servant moses
then sang moses and the children of israel this song unto the lord and spake saying i will sing unto the lord for he hath triumphed gloriously the horse and his rider hath he thrown into the sea
the lord is my strength and song and he is become my salvation he is my god and i will prepare him an habitation my father's god and i will exalt him
the lord is a man of war the lord is his name
pharaoh's chariots and his host hath he cast into the sea his chosen captains also are drowned in the red sea
the depths have covered them they sank into the bottom as a stone
thy right hand o lord is become glorious in power thy right hand o lord hath dashed in pieces the enemy
and in the greatness of thine excellency thou hast overthrown them that rose up against thee thou sentest forth thy wrath which consumed them as stubble
and with the blast of thy nostrils the waters were gathered together the floods stood upright as an heap and the depths were congealed in the heart of the sea
the enemy said i will pursue i will overtake i will divide the spoil my lust shall be satisfied upon them i will draw my sword my hand shall destroy them
thou didst blow with thy wind the sea covered them they sank as lead in the mighty waters
who is like unto thee o lord among the gods who is like thee glorious in holiness fearful in praises doing wonders
thou stretchedst out thy right hand the earth swallowed them
thou in thy mercy hast led forth the people which thou hast redeemed thou hast guided them in thy strength unto thy holy habitation
the people shall hear and be afraid sorrow shall take hold on the inhabitants of palestina
then the dukes of edom shall be amazed the mighty men of moab trembling shall take hold upon them all the inhabitants of canaan shall melt away
fear and dread shall fall upon them by the greatness of thine arm they shall be as still as a stone till thy people pass over o lord till the people pass over which thou hast purchased
thou shalt bring them in and plant them in the mountain of thine inheritance in the place o lord which thou hast made for thee to dwell in in the sanctuary o lord which thy hands have established
the lord shall reign for ever and ever
for the horse of pharaoh went in with his chariots and with his horsemen into the sea and the lord brought again the waters of the sea upon them but the children of israel went on dry land in the midst of the sea
and miriam the prophetess the sister of aaron took a timbrel in her hand and all the women went out after her with timbrels and with dances
and miriam answered them sing ye to the lord for he hath triumphed gloriously the horse and his rider hath he thrown into the sea
so moses brought israel from the red sea and they went out into the wilderness of shur and they went three days in the wilderness and found no water
and when they came to marah they could not drink of the waters of marah for they were bitter therefore the name of it was called marah
and the people murmured against moses saying what shall we drink
and he cried unto the lord and the lord shewed him a tree which when he had cast into the waters the waters were made sweet there he made for them a statute and an ordinance and there he proved them
and said if thou wilt diligently hearken to the voice of the lord thy god and wilt do that which is right in his sight and wilt give ear to his commandments and keep all his statutes i will put none of these diseases upon thee which i have brought upon the egyptians for i am the lord that healeth thee
and they came to elim where were twelve wells of water and threescore and ten palm trees and they encamped there by the waters
and they took their journey from elim and all the congregation of the children of israel came unto the wilderness of sin which is between elim and sinai on the fifteenth day of the second month after their departing out of the land of egypt
and the whole congregation of the children of israel murmured against moses and aaron in the wilderness
and the children of israel said unto them would to god we had died by the hand of the lord in the land of egypt when we sat by the flesh pots and when we did eat bread to the full for ye have brought us forth into this wilderness to kill this whole assembly with hunger
then said the lord unto moses behold i will rain bread from heaven for you and the people shall go out and gather a certain rate every day that i may prove them whether they will walk in my law or no
and it shall come to pass that on the sixth day they shall prepare that which they bring in and it shall be twice as much as they gather daily
and moses and aaron said unto all the children of israel at even then ye shall know that the lord hath brought you out from the land of egypt
and in the morning then ye shall see the glory of the lord for that he heareth your murmurings against the lord and what are we that ye murmur against us
and moses said this shall be when the lord shall give you in the evening flesh to eat and in the morning bread to the full for that the lord heareth your murmurings which ye murmur against him and what are we your murmurings are not against us but against the lord
and moses spake unto aaron say unto all the congregation of the children of israel come near before the lord for he hath heard your murmurings
and it came to pass as aaron spake unto the whole congregation of the children of israel that they looked toward the wilderness and behold the glory of the lord appeared in the cloud
and the lord spake unto moses saying
i have heard the murmurings of the children of israel speak unto them saying at even ye shall eat flesh and in the morning ye shall be filled with bread and ye shall know that i am the lord your god
and it came to pass that at even the quails came up and covered the camp and in the morning the dew lay round about the host
and when the dew that lay was gone up behold upon the face of the wilderness there lay a small round thing as small as the hoar frost on the ground
and when the children of israel saw it they said one to another it is manna for they wist not what it was and moses said unto them this is the bread which the lord hath given you to eat
this is the thing which the lord hath commanded gather of it every man according to his eating an omer for every man according to the number of your persons take ye every man for them which are in his tents
and the children of israel did so and gathered some more some less
and when they did mete it with an omer he that gathered much had nothing over and he that gathered little had no lack they gathered every man according to his eating
and moses said let no man leave of it till the morning
notwithstanding they hearkened not unto moses but some of them left of it until the morning and it bred worms and stank and moses was wroth with them
and they gathered it every morning every man according to his eating and when the sun waxed hot it melted
and it came to pass that on the sixth day they gathered twice as much bread two omers for one man and all the rulers of the congregation came and told moses
and he said unto them this is that which the lord hath said to morrow is the rest of the holy sabbath unto the lord bake that which ye will bake to day and seethe that ye will seethe and that which remaineth over lay up for you to be kept until the morning
and they laid it up till the morning as moses bade and it did not stink neither was there any worm therein
and moses said eat that to day for to day is a sabbath unto the lord to day ye shall not find it in the field
six days ye shall gather it but on the seventh day which is the sabbath in it there shall be none
and it came to pass that there went out some of the people on the seventh day for to gather and they found none
and the lord said unto moses how long refuse ye to keep my commandments and my laws
see for that the lord hath given you the sabbath therefore he giveth you on the sixth day the bread of two days abide ye every man in his place let no man go out of his place on the seventh day
so the people rested on the seventh day
and the house of israel called the name thereof manna and it was like coriander seed white and the taste of it was like wafers made with honey
and moses said this is the thing which the lord commandeth fill an omer of it to be kept for your generations that they may see the bread wherewith i have fed you in the wilderness when i brought you forth from the land of egypt
and moses said unto aaron take a pot and put an omer full of manna therein and lay it up before the lord to be kept for your generations
as the lord commanded moses so aaron laid it up before the testimony to be kept
and the children of israel did eat manna forty years until they came to a land inhabited they did eat manna until they came unto the borders of the land of canaan
now an omer is the tenth part of an ephah
and all the congregation of the children of israel journeyed from the wilderness of sin after their journeys according to the commandment of the lord and pitched in rephidim and there was no water for the people to drink
wherefore the people did chide with moses and said give us water that we may drink and moses said unto them why chide ye with me wherefore do ye tempt the lord
and the people thirsted there for water and the people murmured against moses and said wherefore is this that thou hast brought us up out of egypt to kill us and our children and our cattle with thirst
and moses cried unto the lord saying what shall i do unto this people they be almost ready to stone me
and the lord said unto moses go on before the people and take with thee of the elders of israel and thy rod wherewith thou smotest the river take in thine hand and go
behold i will stand before thee there upon the rock in horeb and thou shalt smite the rock and there shall come water out of it that the people may drink and moses did so in the sight of the elders of israel
and he called the name of the place massah and meribah because of the chiding of the children of israel and because they tempted the lord saying is the lord among us or not
then came amalek and fought with israel in rephidim
and moses said unto joshua choose us out men and go out fight with amalek to morrow i will stand on the top of the hill with the rod of god in mine hand
so joshua did as moses had said to him and fought with amalek and moses aaron and hur went up to the top of the hill
and it came to pass when moses held up his hand that israel prevailed and when he let down his hand amalek prevailed
but moses hands were heavy and they took a stone and put it under him and he sat thereon and aaron and hur stayed up his hands the one on the one side and the other on the other side and his hands were steady until the going down of the sun
and joshua discomfited amalek and his people with the edge of the sword
and the lord said unto moses write this for a memorial in a book and rehearse it in the ears of joshua for i will utterly put out the remembrance of amalek from under heaven
