 mischance unto my state by suffolk's means
 and therefore by his majesty i swear
 whose far unworthy deputy i am
 he shall not breathe infection in this air
 but three days longer on the pain of death
 exit salisbury
queen margaret o henry let me plead for gentle suffolk
king henry vi ungentle queen to call him gentle suffolk
 no more i say if thou dost plead for him
 thou wilt but add increase unto my wrath
 had i but said i would have kept my word
 but when i swear it is irrevocable
 if after three days space thou here be'st found
 on any ground that i am ruler of
 the world shall not be ransom for thy life
 come warwick come good warwick go with me
 i have great matters to impart to thee
 exeunt all but queen margaret and suffolk
queen margaret mischance and sorrow go along with you
 heart's discontent and sour affliction
 be playfellows to keep you company
 there's two of you the devil make a third
 and threefold vengeance tend upon your steps
suffolk cease gentle queen these execrations
 and let thy suffolk take his heavy leave
queen margaret fie coward woman and softhearted wretch
 hast thou not spirit to curse thine enemy
suffolk a plague upon them wherefore should i curse them
 would curses kill as doth the mandrake's groan
 i would invent as bittersearching terms
 as curst as harsh and horrible to hear
 deliver'd strongly through my fixed teeth
 with full as many signs of deadly hate
 as leanfaced envy in her loathsome cave
 my tongue should stumble in mine earnest words
 mine eyes should sparkle like the beaten flint
 mine hair be fixed on end as one distract
 ay every joint should seem to curse and ban
 and even now my burthen'd heart would break
 should i not curse them poison be their drink
 gall worse than gall the daintiest that they taste
 their sweetest shade a grove of cypress trees
 their chiefest prospect murdering basilisks
 their softest touch as smart as lizards sting
 their music frightful as the serpent's hiss
 and boding screechowls make the concert full
 all the foul terrors in darkseated hell
queen margaret enough sweet suffolk thou torment'st thyself
 and these dread curses like the sun gainst glass
 or like an overcharged gun recoil
 and turn the force of them upon thyself
suffolk you bade me ban and will you bid me leave
 now by the ground that i am banish'd from
 well could i curse away a winter's night
 though standing naked on a mountain top
 where biting cold would never let grass grow
 and think it but a minute spent in sport
queen margaret o let me entreat thee cease give me thy hand
 that i may dew it with my mournful tears
 nor let the rain of heaven wet this place
 to wash away my woful monuments
 o could this kiss be printed in thy hand
 that thou mightst think upon these by the seal
 through whom a thousand sighs are breathed for thee
 so get thee gone that i may know my grief
 tis but surmised whiles thou art standing by
 as one that surfeits thinking on a want
 i will repeal thee or be well assured
 adventure to be banished myself
 and banished i am if but from thee
 go speak not to me even now be gone
 o go not yet even thus two friends condemn'd
 embrace and kiss and take ten thousand leaves
 loather a hundred times to part than die
 yet now farewell and farewell life with thee
suffolk thus is poor suffolk ten times banished
 once by the king and three times thrice by thee
 tis not the land i care for wert thou thence
 a wilderness is populous enough
 so suffolk had thy heavenly company
 for where thou art there is the world itself
 with every several pleasure in the world
 and where thou art not desolation
 i can no more live thou to joy thy life
 myself no joy in nought but that thou livest
 enter vaux
queen margaret wither goes vaux so fast what news i prithee
vaux to signify unto his majesty
 that cardinal beaufort is at point of death
 for suddenly a grievous sickness took him
 that makes him gasp and stare and catch the air
 blaspheming god and cursing men on earth
 sometimes he talks as if duke humphrey's ghost
 were by his side sometime he calls the king
 and whispers to his pillow as to him
 the secrets of his overcharged soul
 and i am sent to tell his majesty
 that even now he cries aloud for him
queen margaret go tell this heavy message to the king
 exit vaux
 ay me what is this world what news are these
 but wherefore grieve i at an hour's poor loss
 omitting suffolk's exile my soul's treasure
 why only suffolk mourn i not for thee
 and with the southern clouds contend in tears
 theirs for the earth's increase mine for my sorrows
 now get thee hence the king thou know'st is coming
 if thou be found by me thou art but dead
suffolk if i depart from thee i cannot live
 and in thy sight to die what were it else
 but like a pleasant slumber in thy lap
 here could i breathe my soul into the air
 as mild and gentle as the cradlebabe
 dying with mother's dug between its lips
 where from thy sight i should be raging mad
 and cry out for thee to close up mine eyes
 to have thee with thy lips to stop my mouth
 so shouldst thou either turn my flying soul
 or i should breathe it so into thy body
 and then it lived in sweet elysium
 to die by thee were but to die in jest
 from thee to die were torture more than death
 o let me stay befall what may befall
queen margaret away though parting be a fretful corrosive
 it is applied to a deathful wound
 to france sweet suffolk let me hear from thee
 for wheresoe'er thou art in this world's globe
 i'll have an iris that shall find thee out
suffolk i go
queen margaret and take my heart with thee
suffolk a jewel lock'd into the wofull'st cask
 that ever did contain a thing of worth
 even as a splitted bark so sunder we
 this way fall i to death
queen margaret this way for me
 exeunt severally

 thy sovereign
cardinal if thou be'st death i'll give thee england's treasure

 where death's approach is seen so terrible

 o torture me no more i will confess

 i'll give a thousand pound to look upon him
 he hath no eyes the dust hath blinded them
 comb down his hair look look it stands upright
 like limetwigs set to catch my winged soul
 give me some drink and bid the apothecary
 bring the strong poison that i bought of him
king henry vi o thou eternal mover of the heavens
 look with a gentle eye upon this wretch
 o beat away the busy meddling fiend
 that lays strong siege unto this wretch's soul
 and from his bosom purge this black despair
warwick see how the pangs of death do make him grin
salisbury disturb him not let him pass peaceably
king henry vi peace to his soul if god's good pleasure be
 lord cardinal if thou think'st on heaven's bliss
 hold up thy hand make signal of thy hope
 he dies and makes no sign o god forgive him
warwick so bad a death argues a monstrous life
king henry vi forbear to judge for we are sinners all
 close up his eyes and draw the curtain close
 and let us all to meditation
 exeunt

act iv
scene i the coast of kent
 alarum fight at sea ordnance goes off enter a
 captain a master a master'smate walter whitmore
 and others with them suffolk and others prisoners
captain the gaudy blabbing and remorseful day
 is crept into the bosom of the sea
 and now loudhowling wolves arouse the jades
 that drag the tragic melancholy night
 who with their drowsy slow and flagging wings
 clip dead men's graves and from their misty jaws
 breathe foul contagious darkness in the air
 therefore bring forth the soldiers of our prize
 for whilst our pinnace anchors in the downs
 here shall they make their ransom on the sand
 or with their blood stain this discolour'd shore
 master this prisoner freely give i thee
 and thou that art his mate make boot of this
 the other walter whitmore is thy share
first gentleman what is my ransom master let me know
master a thousand crowns or else lay down your head
master'smate and so much shall you give or off goes yours
captain what think you much to pay two thousand crowns
