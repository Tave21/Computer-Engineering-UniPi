1cor1622 if any man love not the lord jesus christ let him be anathema maranatha
1cor1623 the grace of our lord jesus christ be with you
1cor1624 my love be with you all in christ jesus amen
2cor11 paul an apostle of jesus christ by the will of god and timothy our brother unto the church of god which is at corinth with all the saints which are in all achaia
2cor12 grace be to you and peace from god our father and from the lord jesus christ
2cor13 blessed be god even the father of our lord jesus christ the father of mercies and the god of all comfort
2cor14 who comforteth us in all our tribulation that we may be able to comfort them which are in any trouble by the comfort wherewith we ourselves are comforted of god
2cor15 for as the sufferings of christ abound in us so our consolation also aboundeth by christ
2cor16 and whether we be afflicted it is for your consolation and salvation which is effectual in the enduring of the same sufferings which we also suffer or whether we be comforted it is for your consolation and salvation
2cor17 and our hope of you is stedfast knowing that as ye are partakers of the sufferings so shall ye be also of the consolation
2cor18 for we would not brethren have you ignorant of our trouble which came to us in asia that we were pressed out of measure above strength insomuch that we despaired even of life
2cor19 but we had the sentence of death in ourselves that we should not trust in ourselves but in god which raiseth the dead
2cor110 who delivered us from so great a death and doth deliver in whom we trust that he will yet deliver us
2cor111 ye also helping together by prayer for us that for the gift bestowed upon us by the means of many persons thanks may be given by many on our behalf
2cor112 for our rejoicing is this the testimony of our conscience that in simplicity and godly sincerity not with fleshly wisdom but by the grace of god we have had our conversation in the world and more abundantly to youward
2cor113 for we write none other things unto you than what ye read or acknowledge and i trust ye shall acknowledge even to the end
2cor114 as also ye have acknowledged us in part that we are your rejoicing even as ye also are ours in the day of the lord jesus
2cor115 and in this confidence i was minded to come unto you before that ye might have a second benefit
2cor116 and to pass by you into macedonia and to come again out of macedonia unto you and of you to be brought on my way toward judaea
2cor117 when i therefore was thus minded did i use lightness or the things that i purpose do i purpose according to the flesh that with me there should be yea yea and nay nay
2cor118 but as god is true our word toward you was not yea and nay
2cor119 for the son of god jesus christ who was preached among you by us even by me and silvanus and timotheus was not yea and nay but in him was yea
2cor120 for all the promises of god in him are yea and in him amen unto the glory of god by us
2cor121 now he which stablisheth us with you in christ and hath anointed us is god
2cor122 who hath also sealed us and given the earnest of the spirit in our hearts
2cor123 moreover i call god for a record upon my soul that to spare you i came not as yet unto corinth
2cor124 not for that we have dominion over your faith but are helpers of your joy for by faith ye stand
2cor21 but i determined this with myself that i would not come again to you in heaviness
2cor22 for if i make you sorry who is he then that maketh me glad but the same which is made sorry by me
2cor23 and i wrote this same unto you lest when i came i should have sorrow from them of whom i ought to rejoice having confidence in you all that my joy is the joy of you all
2cor24 for out of much affliction and anguish of heart i wrote unto you with many tears not that ye should be grieved but that ye might know the love which i have more abundantly unto you
2cor25 but if any have caused grief he hath not grieved me but in part that i may not overcharge you all
2cor26 sufficient to such a man is this punishment which was inflicted of many
2cor27 so that contrariwise ye ought rather to forgive him and comfort him lest perhaps such a one should be swallowed up with overmuch sorrow
2cor28 wherefore i beseech you that ye would confirm your love toward him
2cor29 for to this end also did i write that i might know the proof of you whether ye be obedient in all things
2cor210 to whom ye forgive any thing i forgive also for if i forgave any thing to whom i forgave it for your sakes forgave i it in the person of christ
2cor211 lest satan should get an advantage of us for we are not ignorant of his devices
2cor212 furthermore when i came to troas to preach christ's gospel and a door was opened unto me of the lord
2cor213 i had no rest in my spirit because i found not titus my brother but taking my leave of them i went from thence into macedonia
2cor214 now thanks be unto god which always causeth us to triumph in christ and maketh manifest the savour of his knowledge by us in every place
2cor215 for we are unto god a sweet savour of christ in them that are saved and in them that perish
2cor216 to the one we are the savour of death unto death and to the other the savour of life unto life and who is sufficient for these things
2cor217 for we are not as many which corrupt the word of god but as of sincerity but as of god in the sight of god speak we in christ
2cor31 do we begin again to commend ourselves or need we as some others epistles of commendation to you or letters of commendation from you
2cor32 ye are our epistle written in our hearts known and read of all men
2cor33 forasmuch as ye are manifestly declared to be the epistle of christ ministered by us written not with ink but with the spirit of the living god not in tables of stone but in fleshy tables of the heart
2cor34 and such trust have we through christ to godward
2cor35 not that we are sufficient of ourselves to think any thing as of ourselves but our sufficiency is of god
2cor36 who also hath made us able ministers of the new testament not of the letter but of the spirit for the letter killeth but the spirit giveth life
2cor37 but if the ministration of death written and engraven in stones was glorious so that the children of israel could not stedfastly behold the face of moses for the glory of his countenance which glory was to be done away
2cor38 how shall not the ministration of the spirit be rather glorious
2cor39 for if the ministration of condemnation be glory much more doth the ministration of righteousness exceed in glory
2cor310 for even that which was made glorious had no glory in this respect by reason of the glory that excelleth
2cor311 for if that which is done away was glorious much more that which remaineth is glorious
2cor312 seeing then that we have such hope we use great plainness of speech
2cor313 and not as moses which put a vail over his face that the children of israel could not stedfastly look to the end of that which is abolished
2cor314 but their minds were blinded for until this day remaineth the same vail untaken away in the reading of the old testament which vail is done away in christ
2cor315 but even unto this day when moses is read the vail is upon their heart
2cor316 nevertheless when it shall turn to the lord the vail shall be taken away
2cor317 now the lord is that spirit and where the spirit of the lord is there is liberty
2cor318 but we all with open face beholding as in a glass the glory of the lord are changed into the same image from glory to glory even as by the spirit of the lord
2cor41 therefore seeing we have this ministry as we have received mercy we faint not
2cor42 but have renounced the hidden things of dishonesty not walking in craftiness nor handling the word of god deceitfully but by manifestation of the truth commending ourselves to every man's conscience in the sight of god
2cor43 but if our gospel be hid it is hid to them that are lost
2cor44 in whom the god of this world hath blinded the minds of them which believe not lest the light of the glorious gospel of christ who is the image of god should shine unto them
2cor45 for we preach not ourselves but christ jesus the lord and ourselves your servants for jesus sake
2cor46 for god who commanded the light to shine out of darkness hath shined in our hearts to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of god in the face of jesus christ
2cor47 but we have this treasure in earthen vessels that the excellency of the power may be of god and not of us
2cor48 we are troubled on every side yet not distressed we are perplexed but not in despair
2cor49 persecuted but not forsaken cast down but not destroyed
2cor410 always bearing about in the body the dying of the lord jesus that the life also of jesus might be made manifest in our body
2cor411 for we which live are alway delivered unto death for jesus sake that the life also of jesus might be made manifest in our mortal flesh
2cor412 so then death worketh in us but life in you
2cor413 we having the same spirit of faith according as it is written i believed and therefore have i spoken we also believe and therefore speak
2cor414 knowing that he which raised up the lord jesus shall raise up us also by jesus and shall present us with you
2cor415 for all things are for your sakes that the abundant grace might through the thanksgiving of many redound to the glory of god
2cor416 for which cause we faint not but though our outward man perish yet the inward man is renewed day by day
2cor417 for our light affliction which is but for a moment worketh for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory
2cor418 while we look not at the things which are seen but at the things which are not seen for the things which are seen are temporal but the things which are not seen are eternal
2cor51 for we know that if our earthly house of this tabernacle were dissolved we have a building of god an house not made with hands eternal in the heavens
2cor52 for in this we groan earnestly desiring to be clothed upon with our house which is from heaven
2cor53 if so be that being clothed we shall not be found naked
2cor54 for we that are in this tabernacle do groan being burdened not for that we would be unclothed but clothed upon that mortality might be swallowed up of life
2cor55 now he that hath wrought us for the selfsame thing is god who also hath given unto us the earnest of the spirit
2cor56 therefore we are always confident knowing that whilst we are at home in the body we are absent from the lord
2cor57 for we walk by faith not by sight
2cor58 we are confident i say and willing rather to be absent from the body and to be present with the lord
2cor59 wherefore we labour that whether present or absent we may be accepted of him
2cor510 for we must all appear before the judgment seat of christ that every one may receive the things done in his body according to that he hath done whether it be good or bad
2cor511 knowing therefore the terror of the lord we persuade men but we are made manifest unto god and i trust also are made manifest in your consciences
2cor512 for we commend not ourselves again unto you but give you occasion to glory on our behalf that ye may have somewhat to answer them which glory in appearance and not in heart
2cor513 for whether we be beside ourselves it is to god or whether we be sober it is for your cause
2cor514 for the love of christ constraineth us because we thus judge that if one died for all then were all dead
2cor515 and that he died for all that they which live should not henceforth live unto themselves but unto him which died for them and rose again
2cor516 wherefore henceforth know we no man after the flesh yea though we have known christ after the flesh yet now henceforth know we him no more
2cor517 therefore if any man be in christ he is a new creature old things are passed away behold all things are become new
2cor518 and all things are of god who hath reconciled us to himself by jesus christ and hath given to us the ministry of reconciliation
2cor519 to wit that god was in christ reconciling the world unto himself not imputing their trespasses unto them and hath committed unto us the word of reconciliation
2cor520 now then we are ambassadors for christ as though god did beseech you by us we pray you in christ's stead be ye reconciled to god
2cor521 for he hath made him to be sin for us who knew no sin that we might be made the righteousness of god in him
2cor61 we then as workers together with him beseech you also that ye receive not the grace of god in vain
2cor62 for he saith i have heard thee in a time accepted and in the day of salvation have i succoured thee behold now is the accepted time behold now is the day of salvation
2cor63 giving no offence in any thing that the ministry be not blamed
2cor64 but in all things approving ourselves as the ministers of god in much patience in afflictions in necessities in distresses
2cor65 in stripes in imprisonments in tumults in labours in watchings in fastings
2cor66 by pureness by knowledge by longsuffering by kindness by the holy ghost by love unfeigned
2cor67 by the word of truth by the power of god by the armour of righteousness on the right hand and on the left
2cor68 by honour and dishonour by evil report and good report as deceivers and yet true
2cor69 as unknown and yet well known as dying and behold we live as chastened and not killed
2cor610 as sorrowful yet alway rejoicing as poor yet making many rich as having nothing and yet possessing all things
2cor611 o ye corinthians our mouth is open unto you our heart is enlarged
2cor612 ye are not straitened in us but ye are straitened in your own bowels
2cor613 now for a recompence in the same i speak as unto my children be ye also enlarged
2cor614 be ye not unequally yoked together with unbelievers for what fellowship hath righteousness with unrighteousness and what communion hath light with darkness
2cor615 and what concord hath christ with belial or what part hath he that believeth with an infidel
2cor616 and what agreement hath the temple of god with idols for ye are the temple of the living god as god hath said i will dwell in them and walk in them and i will be their god and they shall be my people
2cor617 wherefore come out from among them and be ye separate saith the lord and touch not the unclean thing and i will receive you
2cor618 and will be a father unto you and ye shall be my sons and daughters saith the lord almighty
2cor71 having therefore these promises dearly beloved let us cleanse ourselves from all filthiness of the flesh and spirit perfecting holiness in the fear of god
2cor72 receive us we have wronged no man we have corrupted no man we have defrauded no man
2cor73 i speak not this to condemn you for i have said before that ye are in our hearts to die and live with you
2cor74 great is my boldness of speech toward you great is my glorying of you i am filled with comfort i am exceeding joyful in all our tribulation
2cor75 for when we were come into macedonia our flesh had no rest but we were troubled on every side without were fightings within were fears
2cor76 nevertheless god that comforteth those that are cast down comforted us by the coming of titus
2cor77 and not by his coming only but by the consolation wherewith he was comforted in you when he told us your earnest desire your mourning your fervent mind toward me so that i rejoiced the more
2cor78 for though i made you sorry with a letter i do not repent though i did repent for i perceive that the same epistle hath made you sorry though it were but for a season
2cor79 now i rejoice not that ye were made sorry but that ye sorrowed to repentance for ye were made sorry after a godly manner that ye might receive damage by us in nothing
2cor710 for godly sorrow worketh repentance to salvation not to be repented of but the sorrow of the world worketh death
2cor711 for behold this selfsame thing that ye sorrowed after a godly sort what carefulness it wrought in you yea what clearing of yourselves yea what indignation yea what fear yea what vehement desire yea what zeal yea what revenge in all things ye have approved yourselves to be clear in this matter
2cor712 wherefore though i wrote unto you i did it not for his cause that had done the wrong nor for his cause that suffered wrong but that our care for you in the sight of god might appear unto you
2cor713 therefore we were comforted in your comfort yea and exceedingly the more joyed we for the joy of titus because his spirit was refreshed by you all
2cor714 for if i have boasted any thing to him of you i am not ashamed but as we spake all things to you in truth even so our boasting which i made before titus is found a truth
2cor715 and his inward affection is more abundant toward you whilst he remembereth the obedience of you all how with fear and trembling ye received him
2cor716 i rejoice therefore that i have confidence in you in all things
2cor81 moreover brethren we do you to wit of the grace of god bestowed on the churches of macedonia
2cor82 how that in a great trial of affliction the abundance of their joy and their deep poverty abounded unto the riches of their liberality
2cor83 for to their power i bear record yea and beyond their power they were willing of themselves
2cor84 praying us with much intreaty that we would receive the gift and take upon us the fellowship of the ministering to the saints
2cor85 and this they did not as we hoped but first gave their own selves to the lord and unto us by the will of god
2cor86 insomuch that we desired titus that as he had begun so he would also finish in you the same grace also
2cor87 therefore as ye abound in every thing in faith and utterance and knowledge and in all diligence and in your love to us see that ye abound in this grace also
2cor88 i speak not by commandment but by occasion of the forwardness of others and to prove the sincerity of your love
2cor89 for ye know the grace of our lord jesus christ that though he was rich yet for your sakes he became poor that ye through his poverty might be rich
2cor810 and herein i give my advice for this is expedient for you who have begun before not only to do but also to be forward a year ago
2cor811 now therefore perform the doing of it that as there was a readiness to will so there may be a performance also out of that which ye have
2cor812 for if there be first a willing mind it is accepted according to that a man hath and not according to that he hath not
2cor813 for i mean not that other men be eased and ye burdened
2cor814 but by an equality that now at this time your abundance may be a supply for their want that their abundance also may be a supply for your want that there may be equality
2cor815 as it is written he that had gathered much had nothing over and he that had gathered little had no lack
2cor816 but thanks be to god which put the same earnest care into the heart of titus for you
2cor817 for indeed he accepted the exhortation but being more forward of his own accord he went unto you
2cor818 and we have sent with him the brother whose praise is in the gospel throughout all the churches
2cor819 and not that only but who was also chosen of the churches to travel with us with this grace which is administered by us to the glory of the same lord and declaration of your ready mind
2cor820 avoiding this that no man should blame us in this abundance which is administered by us
2cor821 providing for honest things not only in the sight of the lord but also in the sight of men
2cor822 and we have sent with them our brother whom we have oftentimes proved diligent in many things but now much more diligent upon the great confidence which i have in you
2cor823 whether any do enquire of titus he is my partner and fellowhelper concerning you or our brethren be enquired of they are the messengers of the churches and the glory of christ
2cor824 wherefore shew ye to them and before the churches the proof of your love and of our boasting on your behalf
2cor91 for as touching the ministering to the saints it is superfluous for me to write to you
2cor92 for i know the forwardness of your mind for which i boast of you to them of macedonia that achaia was ready a year ago and your zeal hath provoked very many
2cor93 yet have i sent the brethren lest our boasting of you should be in vain in this behalf that as i said ye may be ready
2cor94 lest haply if they of macedonia come with me and find you unprepared we that we say not ye should be ashamed in this same confident boasting
2cor95 therefore i thought it necessary to exhort the brethren that they would go before unto you and make up beforehand your bounty whereof ye had notice before that the same might be ready as a matter of bounty and not as of covetousness
2cor96 but this i say he which soweth sparingly shall reap also sparingly and he which soweth bountifully shall reap also bountifully
2cor97 every man according as he purposeth in his heart so let him give not grudgingly or of necessity for god loveth a cheerful giver
2cor98 and god is able to make all grace abound toward you that ye always having all sufficiency in all things may abound to every good work
2cor99 as it is written he hath dispersed abroad he hath given to the poor his righteousness remaineth for ever
2cor910 now he that ministereth seed to the sower both minister bread for your food and multiply your seed sown and increase the fruits of your righteousness
2cor911 being enriched in every thing to all bountifulness which causeth through us thanksgiving to god
2cor912 for the administration of this service not only supplieth the want of the saints but is abundant also by many thanksgivings unto god
2cor913 whiles by the experiment of this ministration they glorify god for your professed subjection unto the gospel of christ and for your liberal distribution unto them and unto all men
2cor914 and by their prayer for you which long after you for the exceeding grace of god in you
2cor915 thanks be unto god for his unspeakable gift
2cor101 now i paul myself beseech you by the meekness and gentleness of christ who in presence am base among you but being absent am bold toward you
2cor102 but i beseech you that i may not be bold when i am present with that confidence wherewith i think to be bold against some which think of us as if we walked according to the flesh
2cor103 for though we walk in the flesh we do not war after the flesh
2cor104 for the weapons of our warfare are not carnal but mighty through god to the pulling down of strong holds
2cor105 casting down imaginations and every high thing that exalteth itself against the knowledge of god and bringing into captivity every thought to the obedience of christ
2cor106 and having in a readiness to revenge all disobedience when your obedience is fulfilled
2cor107 do ye look on things after the outward appearance if any man trust to himself that he is christ's let him of himself think this again that as he is christ's even so are we christ's
2cor108 for though i should boast somewhat more of our authority which the lord hath given us for edification and not for your destruction i should not be ashamed
2cor109 that i may not seem as if i would terrify you by letters
2cor1010 for his letters say they are weighty and powerful but his bodily presence is weak and his speech contemptible
2cor1011 let such an one think this that such as we are in word by letters when we are absent such will we be also in deed when we are present
2cor1012 for we dare not make ourselves of the number or compare ourselves with some that commend themselves but they measuring themselves by themselves and comparing themselves among themselves are not wise
2cor1013 but we will not boast of things without our measure but according to the measure of the rule which god hath distributed to us a measure to reach even unto you
2cor1014 for we stretch not ourselves beyond our measure as though we reached not unto you for we are come as far as to you also in preaching the gospel of christ
2cor1015 not boasting of things without our measure that is of other men's labours but having hope when your faith is increased that we shall be enlarged by you according to our rule abundantly
2cor1016 to preach the gospel in the regions beyond you and not to boast in another man's line of things made ready to our hand
2cor1017 but he that glorieth let him glory in the lord
2cor1018 for not he that commendeth himself is approved but whom the lord commendeth
2cor111 would to god ye could bear with me a little in my folly and indeed bear with me
2cor112 for i am jealous over you with godly jealousy for i have espoused you to one husband that i may present you as a chaste virgin to christ
2cor113 but i fear lest by any means as the serpent beguiled eve through his subtilty so your minds should be corrupted from the simplicity that is in christ
2cor114 for if he that cometh preacheth another jesus whom we have not preached or if ye receive another spirit which ye have not received or another gospel which ye have not accepted ye might well bear with him
2cor115 for i suppose i was not a whit behind the very chiefest apostles
2cor116 but though i be rude in speech yet not in knowledge but we have been throughly made manifest among you in all things
2cor117 have i committed an offence in abasing myself that ye might be exalted because i have preached to you the gospel of god freely
2cor118 i robbed other churches taking wages of them to do you service
