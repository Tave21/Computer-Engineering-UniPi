 you would have follow'd
mark antony egypt thou knew'st too well

 and thou shouldst tow me after o'er my spirit

 thy beck might from the bidding of the gods
 command me
cleopatra o my pardon
mark antony now i must
 to the young man send humble treaties dodge
 and palter in the shifts of lowness who
 with half the bulk o the world play'd as i pleased
 making and marring fortunes you did know
 how much you were my conqueror and that
 my sword made weak by my affection would
 obey it on all cause

act iii
scene xii egypt octavius caesar's camp
 enter octavius caesar dolabella thyreus with others
octavius caesar let him appear that's come from antony
 know you him
dolabella caesar tis his schoolmaster
 an argument that he is pluck'd when hither
 he sends so poor a pinion off his wing
 which had superfluous kings for messengers
 not many moons gone by
 enter euphronius ambassador from mark antony
octavius caesar approach and speak
euphronius such as i am i come from antony
 i was of late as petty to his ends
 as is the morndew on the myrtleleaf
 to his grand sea
octavius caesar be't so declare thine office
euphronius lord of his fortunes he salutes thee and
 requires to live in egypt which not granted
 he lessens his requests and to thee sues
 to let him breathe between the heavens and earth
 a private man in athens this for him
 next cleopatra does confess thy greatness
 submits her to thy might and of thee craves
 the circle of the ptolemies for her heirs
 now hazarded to thy grace
octavius caesar for antony
 i have no ears to his request the queen
 of audience nor desire shall fail so she
 from egypt drive her alldisgraced friend
 or take his life there this if she perform
 she shall not sue unheard so to them both
euphronius fortune pursue thee
octavius caesar bring him through the bands
 exit euphronius
 to thyreus to try eloquence now tis time dispatch
 from antony win cleopatra promise
 and in our name what she requires add more
 from thine invention offers women are not
 in their best fortunes strong but want will perjure
 the ne'er touch'd vestal try thy cunning thyreus
 make thine own edict for thy pains which we
 will answer as a law
thyreus caesar i go
octavius caesar observe how antony becomes his flaw
 and what thou think'st his very action speaks
 in every power that moves
thyreus caesar i shall
 exeunt
 antony and cleopatra
act iii
scene xiii alexandria cleopatra's palace
 enter cleopatra domitius enobarbus charmian and iras
cleopatra what shall we do enobarbus
domitius enobarbus think and die
cleopatra is antony or we in fault for this
domitius enobarbus antony only that would make his will
 lord of his reason what though you fled
 from that great face of war whose several ranges
 frighted each other why should he follow
 the itch of his affection should not then
 have nick'd his captainship at such a point
 when half to half the world opposed he being
 the meered question twas a shame no less
 than was his loss to course your flying flags
 and leave his navy gazing
cleopatra prithee peace
 enter mark antony with euphronius the ambassador
mark antony is that his answer
euphronius ay my lord
mark antony the queen shall then have courtesy so she
 will yield us up
euphronius he says so
mark antony let her know't
 to the boy caesar send this grizzled head
 and he will fill thy wishes to the brim
 with principalities
cleopatra that head my lord
mark antony to him again tell him he wears the rose
 of youth upon him from which the world should note
 something particular his coin ships legions
 may be a coward's whose ministers would prevail
 under the service of a child as soon
 as i the command of caesar i dare him therefore
 to lay his gay comparisons apart
 and answer me declined sword against sword
 ourselves alone i'll write it follow me
 exeunt mark antony and euphronius
domitius enobarbus aside yes like enough highbattled caesar will
 unstate his happiness and be staged to the show
 against a sworder i see men's judgments are
 a parcel of their fortunes and things outward
 do draw the inward quality after them
 to suffer all alike that he should dream
 knowing all measures the full caesar will
 answer his emptiness caesar thou hast subdued
 his judgment too
 enter an attendant
attendant a messenger from caesar
cleopatra what no more ceremony see my women
 against the blown rose may they stop their nose
 that kneel'd unto the buds admit him sir
 exit attendant
domitius enobarbus aside mine honesty and i begin to square
 the loyalty well held to fools does make
 our faith mere folly yet he that can endure
 to follow with allegiance a fall'n lord
 does conquer him that did his master conquer
 and earns a place i the story
 enter thyreus
cleopatra caesar's will
thyreus hear it apart
cleopatra none but friends say boldly
thyreus so haply are they friends to antony
domitius enobarbus he needs as many sir as caesar has
 or needs not us if caesar please our master
 will leap to be his friend for us you know
 whose he is we are and that is caesar's
thyreus so
 thus then thou most renown'd caesar entreats
 not to consider in what case thou stand'st
 further than he is caesar
cleopatra go on right royal
thyreus he knows that you embrace not antony
 as you did love but as you fear'd him
cleopatra o
thyreus the scars upon your honour therefore he
 does pity as constrained blemishes
 not as deserved
cleopatra he is a god and knows
 what is most right mine honour was not yielded
 but conquer'd merely
domitius enobarbus aside to be sure of that
 i will ask antony sir sir thou art so leaky
 that we must leave thee to thy sinking for
 thy dearest quit thee
 exit
thyreus shall i say to caesar
 what you require of him for he partly begs
 to be desired to give it much would please him
 that of his fortunes you should make a staff
 to lean upon but it would warm his spirits
 to hear from me you had left antony
 and put yourself under his shrowd
 the universal landlord
cleopatra what's your name
thyreus my name is thyreus
