act v
scene i salisbury an open place
 enter the sheriff and buckingham with halberds
 led to execution
buckingham will not king richard let me speak with him
sheriff no my good lord therefore be patient
buckingham hastings and edward's children rivers grey
 holy king henry and thy fair son edward
 vaughan and all that have miscarried
 by underhand corrupted foul injustice
 if that your moody discontented souls
 do through the clouds behold this present hour
 even for revenge mock my destruction
 this is allsouls day fellows is it not
sheriff it is my lord
buckingham why then allsouls day is my body's doomsday
 this is the day that in king edward's time
 i wish't might fall on me when i was found
 false to his children or his wife's allies
 this is the day wherein i wish'd to fall
 by the false faith of him i trusted most
 this this allsouls day to my fearful soul
 is the determined respite of my wrongs
 that high allseer that i dallied with
 hath turn'd my feigned prayer on my head
 and given in earnest what i begg'd in jest
 thus doth he force the swords of wicked men
 to turn their own points on their masters bosoms
 now margaret's curse is fallen upon my head
 when he quoth she shall split thy heart with sorrow
 remember margaret was a prophetess'
 come sirs convey me to the block of shame
 wrong hath but wrong and blame the due of blame

scene ii the camp near tamworth
 enter richmond oxford blunt herbert and others
 with drum and colours
richmond fellows in arms and my most loving friends
 bruised underneath the yoke of tyranny
 thus far into the bowels of the land
 have we march'd on without impediment
 and here receive we from our father stanley
 lines of fair comfort and encouragement
 the wretched bloody and usurping boar
 that spoil'd your summer fields and fruitful vines
 swills your warm blood like wash and makes his trough
 in your embowell'd bosoms this foul swine
 lies now even in the centre of this isle
 near to the town of leicester as we learn
 from tamworth thither is but one day's march
 in god's name cheerly on courageous friends
 to reap the harvest of perpetual peace
 by this one bloody trial of sharp war
oxford every man's conscience is a thousand swords
 to fight against that bloody homicide
herbert i doubt not but his friends will fly to us
blunt he hath no friends but who are friends for fear
 which in his greatest need will shrink from him
richmond all for our vantage then in god's name march
 true hope is swift and flies with swallow's wings
 kings it makes gods and meaner creatures kings
