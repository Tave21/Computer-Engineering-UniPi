king henry v well have we done thrice valiant countrymen
 but all's not done yet keep the french the field
exeter the duke of york commends him to your majesty
king henry v lives he good uncle thrice within this hour
 i saw him down thrice up again and fighting
 from helmet to the spur all blood he was
exeter in which array brave soldier doth he lie
 larding the plain and by his bloody side
 yokefellow to his honourowing wounds
 the noble earl of suffolk also lies
 suffolk first died and york all haggled over
 comes to him where in gore he lay insteep'd
 and takes him by the beard kisses the gashes
 that bloodily did spawn upon his face
 and cries aloud tarry dear cousin suffolk
 my soul shall thine keep company to heaven
 tarry sweet soul for mine then fly abreast
 as in this glorious and wellfoughten field
 we kept together in our chivalry'
 upon these words i came and cheer'd him up
 he smiled me in the face raught me his hand
 and with a feeble gripe says dear my lord
 commend my service to me sovereign'
 so did he turn and over suffolk's neck
 he threw his wounded arm and kiss'd his lips
 and so espoused to death with blood he seal'd
 a testament of nobleending love
 the pretty and sweet manner of it forced
 those waters from me which i would have stopp'd
 but i had not so much of man in me
 and all my mother came into mine eyes
 and gave me up to tears
king henry v i blame you not
 for hearing this i must perforce compound
 with mistful eyes or they will issue too
 alarum
