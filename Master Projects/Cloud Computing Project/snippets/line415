 the imperious seas breed monsters for the dish
 poor tributary rivers as sweet fish
 i am sick still heartsick pisanio
 i'll now taste of thy drug
 swallows some
guiderius i could not stir him
 he said he was gentle but unfortunate
 dishonestly afflicted but yet honest
arviragus thus did he answer me yet said hereafter
 i might know more
belarius to the field to the field
 we'll leave you for this time go in and rest
arviragus we'll not be long away
belarius pray be not sick
 for you must be our housewife
imogen well or ill
 i am bound to you
belarius and shalt be ever
 exit imogen to the cave
 this youth how'er distress'd appears he hath had
 good ancestors
arviragus how angellike he sings
guiderius but his neat cookery he cut our roots
 in characters
 and sauced our broths as juno had been sick
 and he her dieter
arviragus nobly he yokes
 a smiling with a sigh as if the sigh
 was that it was for not being such a smile
 the smile mocking the sigh that it would fly
 from so divine a temple to commix
 with winds that sailors rail at
guiderius i do note
 that grief and patience rooted in him both
 mingle their spurs together
arviragus grow patience
 and let the stinking elder grief untwine
 his perishing root with the increasing vine
belarius it is great morning come away
 who's there
 enter cloten
cloten i cannot find those runagates that villain
 hath mock'd me i am faint
belarius those runagates'
 means he not us i partly know him tis
 cloten the son o the queen i fear some ambush
 i saw him not these many years and yet
 i know tis he we are held as outlaws hence
guiderius he is but one you and my brother search
 what companies are near pray you away
 let me alone with him
 exeunt belarius and arviragus
cloten soft what are you
 that fly me thus some villain mountaineers
 i have heard of such what slave art thou
guiderius a thing
 more slavish did i ne'er than answering
 a slave without a knock
cloten thou art a robber
 a lawbreaker a villain yield thee thief
guiderius to who to thee what art thou have not i
 an arm as big as thine a heart as big
 thy words i grant are bigger for i wear not
 my dagger in my mouth say what thou art
 why i should yield to thee
cloten thou villain base
 know'st me not by my clothes
guiderius no nor thy tailor rascal
 who is thy grandfather he made those clothes
 which as it seems make thee
cloten thou precious varlet
 my tailor made them not
guiderius hence then and thank
 the man that gave them thee thou art some fool
 i am loath to beat thee
cloten thou injurious thief
 hear but my name and tremble
guiderius what's thy name
cloten cloten thou villain
guiderius cloten thou double villain be thy name
 i cannot tremble at it were it toad or
 adder spider
 twould move me sooner
cloten to thy further fear
 nay to thy mere confusion thou shalt know
 i am son to the queen
guiderius i am sorry for t not seeming
 so worthy as thy birth
cloten art not afeard
guiderius those that i reverence those i fear the wise
 at fools i laugh not fear them
cloten die the death
 when i have slain thee with my proper hand
 i'll follow those that even now fled hence
 and on the gates of lud'stown set your heads
 yield rustic mountaineer
 exeunt fighting
 reenter belarius and arviragus
belarius no companies abroad
arviragus none in the world you did mistake him sure
belarius i cannot tell long is it since i saw him
 but time hath nothing blurr'd those lines of favour
 which then he wore the snatches in his voice
 and burst of speaking were as his i am absolute
 twas very cloten
arviragus in this place we left them
 i wish my brother make good time with him
 you say he is so fell
belarius being scarce made up
 i mean to man he had not apprehension
 of roaring terrors for the effect of judgment
 is oft the cause of fear but see thy brother
 reenter guiderius with cloten's head
guiderius this cloten was a fool an empty purse
 there was no money in't not hercules
 could have knock'd out his brains for he had none
 yet i not doing this the fool had borne
 my head as i do his
belarius what hast thou done
guiderius i am perfect what cut off one cloten's head
 son to the queen after his own report
 who call'd me traitor mountaineer and swore
 with his own single hand he'ld take us in
 displace our heads wherethank the godsthey grow
 and set them on lud'stown
belarius we are all undone
guiderius why worthy father what have we to lose
 but that he swore to take our lives the law
 protects not us then why should we be tender
 to let an arrogant piece of flesh threat us
 play judge and executioner all himself
 for we do fear the law what company
 discover you abroad
belarius no single soul
 can we set eye on but in all safe reason
 he must have some attendants though his humour
 was nothing but mutation ay and that
 from one bad thing to worse not frenzy not
 absolute madness could so far have raved
 to bring him here alone although perhaps
 it may be heard at court that such as we
 cave here hunt here are outlaws and in time
 may make some stronger head the which he hearing
 as it is like himmight break out and swear
 he'ld fetch us in yet is't not probable
 to come alone either he so undertaking
 or they so suffering then on good ground we fear
 if we do fear this body hath a tail
 more perilous than the head
arviragus let ordinance
 come as the gods foresay it howsoe'er
 my brother hath done well
belarius i had no mind
 to hunt this day the boy fidele's sickness
 did make my way long forth
guiderius with his own sword
 which he did wave against my throat i have ta'en
 his head from him i'll throw't into the creek
 behind our rock and let it to the sea
 and tell the fishes he's the queen's son cloten
 that's all i reck
 exit
belarius i fear twill be revenged
 would polydote thou hadst not done't though valour
 becomes thee well enough
arviragus would i had done't
 so the revenge alone pursued me polydore
 i love thee brotherly but envy much
 thou hast robb'd me of this deed i would revenges
 that possible strength might meet would seek us through
 and put us to our answer
belarius well tis done
 we'll hunt no more today nor seek for danger
 where there's no profit i prithee to our rock
 you and fidele play the cooks i'll stay
 till hasty polydote return and bring him
 to dinner presently
arviragus poor sick fidele
 i'll weringly to him to gain his colour
 i'ld let a parish of such clotens blood
 and praise myself for charity
 exit
belarius o thou goddess
 thou divine nature how thyself thou blazon'st
 in these two princely boys they are as gentle
 as zephyrs blowing below the violet
 not wagging his sweet head and yet as rough
 their royal blood enchafed as the rudest wind
 that by the top doth take the mountain pine
 and make him stoop to the vale tis wonder
 that an invisible instinct should frame them
 to royalty unlearn'd honour untaught
 civility not seen from other valour
 that wildly grows in them but yields a crop
 as if it had been sow'd yet still it's strange
 what cloten's being here to us portends
 or what his death will bring us
 reenter guiderius
guiderius where's my brother
 i have sent cloten's clotpoll down the stream
