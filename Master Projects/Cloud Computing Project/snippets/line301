balthasar here's one a friend and one that knows you well
friar laurence bliss be upon you tell me good my friend

 and fearfully did menace me with death
 if i did stay to look on his intents
friar laurence stay then i'll go alone fear comes upon me
 o much i fear some ill unlucky thing
balthasar as i did sleep under this yewtree here
 i dreamt my master and another fought
 and that my master slew him
friar laurence romeo

 the stony entrance of this sepulchre
 what mean these masterless and gory swords
 to lie discolour'd by this place of peace
 enters the tomb

 and steep'd in blood ah what an unkind hour
 is guilty of this lamentable chance
 the lady stirs
 juliet wakes
juliet o comfortable friar where is my lord
 i do remember well where i should be
 and there i am where is my romeo

 of death contagion and unnatural sleep

 exit friar laurence
 what's here a cup closed in my true love's hand

 haply some poison yet doth hang on them
 to make die with a restorative
 kisses him

first watchman within lead boy which way
juliet yea noise then i'll be brief o happy dagger
 snatching romeo's dagger
 this is thy sheath
 stabs herself
 there rust and let me die
 falls on romeo's body and dies
 enter watch with the page of paris
page this is the place there where the torch doth burn
first watchman the ground is bloody search about the churchyard
 go some of you whoe'er you find attach
 pitiful sight here lies the county slain
 and juliet bleeding warm and newly dead
 who here hath lain these two days buried
 go tell the prince run to the capulets
 raise up the montagues some others search
 we see the ground whereon these woes do lie
 but the true ground of all these piteous woes
 we cannot without circumstance descry
 reenter some of the watch with balthasar
second watchman here's romeo's man we found him in the churchyard
first watchman hold him in safety till the prince come hither
 reenter others of the watch with friar laurence
third watchman here is a friar that trembles sighs and weeps
 we took this mattock and this spade from him
 as he was coming from this churchyard side
first watchman a great suspicion stay the friar too
 enter the prince and attendants
prince what misadventure is so early up
 that calls our person from our morning's rest
 enter capulet lady capulet and others
capulet what should it be that they so shriek abroad
lady capulet the people in the street cry romeo
 some juliet and some paris and all run
 with open outcry toward our monument
prince what fear is this which startles in our ears
first watchman sovereign here lies the county paris slain
 and romeo dead and juliet dead before
 warm and new kill'd
prince search seek and know how this foul murder comes
first watchman here is a friar and slaughter'd romeo's man
 with instruments upon them fit to open
 these dead men's tombs
capulet o heavens o wife look how our daughter bleeds
 this dagger hath mista'enfor lo his house
 is empty on the back of montague
 and it missheathed in my daughter's bosom
lady capulet o me this sight of death is as a bell
 that warns my old age to a sepulchre
 enter montague and others
prince come montague for thou art early up
 to see thy son and heir more early down
montague alas my liege my wife is dead tonight
 grief of my son's exile hath stopp'd her breath
 what further woe conspires against mine age
prince look and thou shalt see
montague o thou untaught what manners is in this
 to press before thy father to a grave
prince seal up the mouth of outrage for a while
 till we can clear these ambiguities
 and know their spring their head their
 true descent
 and then will i be general of your woes
 and lead you even to death meantime forbear
 and let mischance be slave to patience
 bring forth the parties of suspicion
friar laurence i am the greatest able to do least
 yet most suspected as the time and place
 doth make against me of this direful murder
 and here i stand both to impeach and purge
 myself condemned and myself excused
prince then say at once what thou dost know in this
friar laurence i will be brief for my short date of breath
 is not so long as is a tedious tale
 romeo there dead was husband to that juliet
 and she there dead that romeo's faithful wife
 i married them and their stol'n marriageday
 was tybalt's doomsday whose untimely death
 banish'd the newmade bridegroom from the city
 for whom and not for tybalt juliet pined
 you to remove that siege of grief from her
 betroth'd and would have married her perforce
 to county paris then comes she to me
 and with wild looks bid me devise some mean
 to rid her from this second marriage
 or in my cell there would she kill herself
 then gave i her so tutor'd by my art
 a sleeping potion which so took effect
 as i intended for it wrought on her
 the form of death meantime i writ to romeo
 that he should hither come as this dire night
 to help to take her from her borrow'd grave
 being the time the potion's force should cease
 but he which bore my letter friar john
 was stay'd by accident and yesternight
 return'd my letter back then all alone
 at the prefixed hour of her waking
 came i to take her from her kindred's vault
 meaning to keep her closely at my cell
 till i conveniently could send to romeo
 but when i came some minute ere the time
 of her awaking here untimely lay
 the noble paris and true romeo dead
 she wakes and i entreated her come forth
 and bear this work of heaven with patience
 but then a noise did scare me from the tomb
 and she too desperate would not go with me
 but as it seems did violence on herself
 all this i know and to the marriage
 her nurse is privy and if aught in this
 miscarried by my fault let my old life
 be sacrificed some hour before his time
 unto the rigour of severest law
prince we still have known thee for a holy man
 where's romeo's man what can he say in this
balthasar i brought my master news of juliet's death
 and then in post he came from mantua
 to this same place to this same monument
 this letter he early bid me give his father
 and threatened me with death going in the vault
 i departed not and left him there
prince give me the letter i will look on it
 where is the county's page that raised the watch
 sirrah what made your master in this place
page he came with flowers to strew his lady's grave
 and bid me stand aloof and so i did
 anon comes one with light to ope the tomb
 and by and by my master drew on him
 and then i ran away to call the watch
prince this letter doth make good the friar's words
 their course of love the tidings of her death
 and here he writes that he did buy a poison
 of a poor pothecary and therewithal
 came to this vault to die and lie with juliet
 where be these enemies capulet montague
 see what a scourge is laid upon your hate
 that heaven finds means to kill your joys with love
 and i for winking at your discords too
 have lost a brace of kinsmen all are punish'd
capulet o brother montague give me thy hand
 this is my daughter's jointure for no more
