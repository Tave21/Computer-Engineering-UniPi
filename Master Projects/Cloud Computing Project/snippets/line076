so we thy people and sheep of thy pasture will give thee thanks for ever we will shew forth thy praise to all generations
give ear o shepherd of israel thou that leadest joseph like a flock thou that dwellest between the cherubims shine forth
before ephraim and benjamin and manasseh stir up thy strength and come and save us
turn us again o god and cause thy face to shine and we shall be saved
o lord god of hosts how long wilt thou be angry against the prayer of thy people
thou feedest them with the bread of tears and givest them tears to drink in great measure
thou makest us a strife unto our neighbours and our enemies laugh among themselves
turn us again o god of hosts and cause thy face to shine and we shall be saved
thou hast brought a vine out of egypt thou hast cast out the heathen and planted it
thou preparedst room before it and didst cause it to take deep root and it filled the land
the hills were covered with the shadow of it and the boughs thereof were like the goodly cedars
she sent out her boughs unto the sea and her branches unto the river
why hast thou then broken down her hedges so that all they which pass by the way do pluck her
the boar out of the wood doth waste it and the wild beast of the field doth devour it
return we beseech thee o god of hosts look down from heaven and behold and visit this vine
and the vineyard which thy right hand hath planted and the branch that thou madest strong for thyself
it is burned with fire it is cut down they perish at the rebuke of thy countenance
let thy hand be upon the man of thy right hand upon the son of man whom thou madest strong for thyself
so will not we go back from thee quicken us and we will call upon thy name
turn us again o lord god of hosts cause thy face to shine and we shall be saved
sing aloud unto god our strength make a joyful noise unto the god of jacob
take a psalm and bring hither the timbrel the pleasant harp with the psaltery
blow up the trumpet in the new moon in the time appointed on our solemn feast day
for this was a statute for israel and a law of the god of jacob
this he ordained in joseph for a testimony when he went out through the land of egypt where i heard a language that i understood not
i removed his shoulder from the burden his hands were delivered from the pots
thou calledst in trouble and i delivered thee i answered thee in the secret place of thunder i proved thee at the waters of meribah selah
hear o my people and i will testify unto thee o israel if thou wilt hearken unto me
there shall no strange god be in thee neither shalt thou worship any strange god
i am the lord thy god which brought thee out of the land of egypt open thy mouth wide and i will fill it
but my people would not hearken to my voice and israel would none of me
so i gave them up unto their own hearts lust and they walked in their own counsels
oh that my people had hearkened unto me and israel had walked in my ways
i should soon have subdued their enemies and turned my hand against their adversaries
the haters of the lord should have submitted themselves unto him but their time should have endured for ever
he should have fed them also with the finest of the wheat and with honey out of the rock should i have satisfied thee
god standeth in the congregation of the mighty he judgeth among the gods
how long will ye judge unjustly and accept the persons of the wicked selah
defend the poor and fatherless do justice to the afflicted and needy
deliver the poor and needy rid them out of the hand of the wicked
they know not neither will they understand they walk on in darkness all the foundations of the earth are out of course
i have said ye are gods and all of you are children of the most high
but ye shall die like men and fall like one of the princes
arise o god judge the earth for thou shalt inherit all nations
keep not thou silence o god hold not thy peace and be not still o god
for lo thine enemies make a tumult and they that hate thee have lifted up the head
they have taken crafty counsel against thy people and consulted against thy hidden ones
they have said come and let us cut them off from being a nation that the name of israel may be no more in remembrance
for they have consulted together with one consent they are confederate against thee
the tabernacles of edom and the ishmaelites of moab and the hagarenes
gebal and ammon and amalek the philistines with the inhabitants of tyre
assur also is joined with them they have holpen the children of lot selah
do unto them as unto the midianites as to sisera as to jabin at the brook of kison
which perished at endor they became as dung for the earth
make their nobles like oreb and like zeeb yea all their princes as zebah and as zalmunna
who said let us take to ourselves the houses of god in possession
o my god make them like a wheel as the stubble before the wind
as the fire burneth a wood and as the flame setteth the mountains on fire
so persecute them with thy tempest and make them afraid with thy storm
fill their faces with shame that they may seek thy name o lord
let them be confounded and troubled for ever yea let them be put to shame and perish
that men may know that thou whose name alone is jehovah art the most high over all the earth
how amiable are thy tabernacles o lord of hosts
my soul longeth yea even fainteth for the courts of the lord my heart and my flesh crieth out for the living god
yea the sparrow hath found an house and the swallow a nest for herself where she may lay her young even thine altars o lord of hosts my king and my god
blessed are they that dwell in thy house they will be still praising thee selah
blessed is the man whose strength is in thee in whose heart are the ways of them
who passing through the valley of baca make it a well the rain also filleth the pools
they go from strength to strength every one of them in zion appeareth before god
o lord god of hosts hear my prayer give ear o god of jacob selah
behold o god our shield and look upon the face of thine anointed
for a day in thy courts is better than a thousand i had rather be a doorkeeper in the house of my god than to dwell in the tents of wickedness
for the lord god is a sun and shield the lord will give grace and glory no good thing will he withhold from them that walk uprightly
o lord of hosts blessed is the man that trusteth in thee
lord thou hast been favourable unto thy land thou hast brought back the captivity of jacob
thou hast forgiven the iniquity of thy people thou hast covered all their sin selah
thou hast taken away all thy wrath thou hast turned thyself from the fierceness of thine anger
turn us o god of our salvation and cause thine anger toward us to cease
wilt thou be angry with us for ever wilt thou draw out thine anger to all generations
wilt thou not revive us again that thy people may rejoice in thee
shew us thy mercy o lord and grant us thy salvation
i will hear what god the lord will speak for he will speak peace unto his people and to his saints but let them not turn again to folly
surely his salvation is nigh them that fear him that glory may dwell in our land
mercy and truth are met together righteousness and peace have kissed each other
truth shall spring out of the earth and righteousness shall look down from heaven
yea the lord shall give that which is good and our land shall yield her increase
righteousness shall go before him and shall set us in the way of his steps
bow down thine ear o lord hear me for i am poor and needy
preserve my soul for i am holy o thou my god save thy servant that trusteth in thee
be merciful unto me o lord for i cry unto thee daily
rejoice the soul of thy servant for unto thee o lord do i lift up my soul
for thou lord art good and ready to forgive and plenteous in mercy unto all them that call upon thee
give ear o lord unto my prayer and attend to the voice of my supplications
in the day of my trouble i will call upon thee for thou wilt answer me
among the gods there is none like unto thee o lord neither are there any works like unto thy works
all nations whom thou hast made shall come and worship before thee o lord and shall glorify thy name
for thou art great and doest wondrous things thou art god alone
teach me thy way o lord i will walk in thy truth unite my heart to fear thy name
i will praise thee o lord my god with all my heart and i will glorify thy name for evermore
for great is thy mercy toward me and thou hast delivered my soul from the lowest hell
o god the proud are risen against me and the assemblies of violent men have sought after my soul and have not set thee before them
but thou o lord art a god full of compassion and gracious long suffering and plenteous in mercy and truth
o turn unto me and have mercy upon me give thy strength unto thy servant and save the son of thine handmaid
shew me a token for good that they which hate me may see it and be ashamed because thou lord hast holpen me and comforted me
his foundation is in the holy mountains
the lord loveth the gates of zion more than all the dwellings of jacob
glorious things are spoken of thee o city of god selah
i will make mention of rahab and babylon to them that know me behold philistia and tyre with ethiopia this man was born there
and of zion it shall be said this and that man was born in her and the highest himself shall establish her
the lord shall count when he writeth up the people that this man was born there selah
as well the singers as the players on instruments shall be there all my springs are in thee
o lord god of my salvation i have cried day and night before thee
let my prayer come before thee incline thine ear unto my cry
for my soul is full of troubles and my life draweth nigh unto the grave
i am counted with them that go down into the pit i am as a man that hath no strength
free among the dead like the slain that lie in the grave whom thou rememberest no more and they are cut off from thy hand
thou hast laid me in the lowest pit in darkness in the deeps
thy wrath lieth hard upon me and thou hast afflicted me with all thy waves selah
thou hast put away mine acquaintance far from me thou hast made me an abomination unto them i am shut up and i cannot come forth
mine eye mourneth by reason of affliction lord i have called daily upon thee i have stretched out my hands unto thee
wilt thou shew wonders to the dead shall the dead arise and praise thee selah
shall thy lovingkindness be declared in the grave or thy faithfulness in destruction
shall thy wonders be known in the dark and thy righteousness in the land of forgetfulness
but unto thee have i cried o lord and in the morning shall my prayer prevent thee
lord why castest thou off my soul why hidest thou thy face from me
i am afflicted and ready to die from my youth up while i suffer thy terrors i am distracted
thy fierce wrath goeth over me thy terrors have cut me off
they came round about me daily like water they compassed me about together
lover and friend hast thou put far from me and mine acquaintance into darkness
i will sing of the mercies of the lord for ever with my mouth will i make known thy faithfulness to all generations
for i have said mercy shall be built up for ever thy faithfulness shalt thou establish in the very heavens
i have made a covenant with my chosen i have sworn unto david my servant
thy seed will i establish for ever and build up thy throne to all generations selah
and the heavens shall praise thy wonders o lord thy faithfulness also in the congregation of the saints
for who in the heaven can be compared unto the lord who among the sons of the mighty can be likened unto the lord
god is greatly to be feared in the assembly of the saints and to be had in reverence of all them that are about him
o lord god of hosts who is a strong lord like unto thee or to thy faithfulness round about thee
thou rulest the raging of the sea when the waves thereof arise thou stillest them
thou hast broken rahab in pieces as one that is slain thou hast scattered thine enemies with thy strong arm
the heavens are thine the earth also is thine as for the world and the fulness thereof thou hast founded them
the north and the south thou hast created them tabor and hermon shall rejoice in thy name
thou hast a mighty arm strong is thy hand and high is thy right hand
justice and judgment are the habitation of thy throne mercy and truth shall go before thy face
blessed is the people that know the joyful sound they shall walk o lord in the light of thy countenance
in thy name shall they rejoice all the day and in thy righteousness shall they be exalted
for thou art the glory of their strength and in thy favour our horn shall be exalted
for the lord is our defence and the holy one of israel is our king
then thou spakest in vision to thy holy one and saidst i have laid help upon one that is mighty i have exalted one chosen out of the people
i have found david my servant with my holy oil have i anointed him
with whom my hand shall be established mine arm also shall strengthen him
the enemy shall not exact upon him nor the son of wickedness afflict him
and i will beat down his foes before his face and plague them that hate him
but my faithfulness and my mercy shall be with him and in my name shall his horn be exalted
i will set his hand also in the sea and his right hand in the rivers
he shall cry unto me thou art my father my god and the rock of my salvation
also i will make him my firstborn higher than the kings of the earth
my mercy will i keep for him for evermore and my covenant shall stand fast with him
his seed also will i make to endure for ever and his throne as the days of heaven
if his children forsake my law and walk not in my judgments
if they break my statutes and keep not my commandments
then will i visit their transgression with the rod and their iniquity with stripes
nevertheless my lovingkindness will i not utterly take from him nor suffer my faithfulness to fail
my covenant will i not break nor alter the thing that is gone out of my lips
once have i sworn by my holiness that i will not lie unto david
his seed shall endure for ever and his throne as the sun before me
it shall be established for ever as the moon and as a faithful witness in heaven selah
but thou hast cast off and abhorred thou hast been wroth with thine anointed
thou hast made void the covenant of thy servant thou hast profaned his crown by casting it to the ground
thou hast broken down all his hedges thou hast brought his strong holds to ruin
all that pass by the way spoil him he is a reproach to his neighbours
thou hast set up the right hand of his adversaries thou hast made all his enemies to rejoice
thou hast also turned the edge of his sword and hast not made him to stand in the battle
thou hast made his glory to cease and cast his throne down to the ground
the days of his youth hast thou shortened thou hast covered him with shame selah
how long lord wilt thou hide thyself for ever shall thy wrath burn like fire
remember how short my time is wherefore hast thou made all men in vain
what man is he that liveth and shall not see death shall he deliver his soul from the hand of the grave selah
lord where are thy former lovingkindnesses which thou swarest unto david in thy truth
remember lord the reproach of thy servants how i do bear in my bosom the reproach of all the mighty people
wherewith thine enemies have reproached o lord wherewith they have reproached the footsteps of thine anointed
blessed be the lord for evermore amen and amen
lord thou hast been our dwelling place in all generations
before the mountains were brought forth or ever thou hadst formed the earth and the world even from everlasting to everlasting thou art god
thou turnest man to destruction and sayest return ye children of men
for a thousand years in thy sight are but as yesterday when it is past and as a watch in the night
thou carriest them away as with a flood they are as a sleep in the morning they are like grass which groweth up
in the morning it flourisheth and groweth up in the evening it is cut down and withereth
for we are consumed by thine anger and by thy wrath are we troubled
thou hast set our iniquities before thee our secret sins in the light of thy countenance
for all our days are passed away in thy wrath we spend our years as a tale that is told
the days of our years are threescore years and ten and if by reason of strength they be fourscore years yet is their strength labour and sorrow for it is soon cut off and we fly away
who knoweth the power of thine anger even according to thy fear so is thy wrath
so teach us to number our days that we may apply our hearts unto wisdom
return o lord how long and let it repent thee concerning thy servants
o satisfy us early with thy mercy that we may rejoice and be glad all our days
make us glad according to the days wherein thou hast afflicted us and the years wherein we have seen evil
let thy work appear unto thy servants and thy glory unto their children
and let the beauty of the lord our god be upon us and establish thou the work of our hands upon us yea the work of our hands establish thou it
he that dwelleth in the secret place of the most high shall abide under the shadow of the almighty
i will say of the lord he is my refuge and my fortress my god in him will i trust
