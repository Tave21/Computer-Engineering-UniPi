gloucester aside but when the fox hath once got in his nose
 he'll soon find means to make the body follow
hastings why master mayor why stand you in a doubt
 open the gates we are king henry's friends
mayor ay say you so the gates shall then be open'd
 they descend
gloucester a wise stout captain and soon persuaded
hastings the good old man would fain that all were well
 so twere not long of him but being enter'd
 i doubt not i but we shall soon persuade
 both him and all his brothers unto reason
 enter the mayor and two aldermen below
king edward iv so master mayor these gates must not be shut
 but in the night or in the time of war
 what fear not man but yield me up the keys
 takes his keys
 for edward will defend the town and thee
 and all those friends that deign to follow me
 march enter montgomery with drum and soldiers
gloucester brother this is sir john montgomery
 our trusty friend unless i be deceived
king edward iv welcome sir john but why come you in arms
montague to help king edward in his time of storm
 as every loyal subject ought to do
king edward iv thanks good montgomery but we now forget
 our title to the crown and only claim
 our dukedom till god please to send the rest
montague then fare you well for i will hence again
 i came to serve a king and not a duke
 drummer strike up and let us march away
 the drum begins to march
king edward iv nay stay sir john awhile and we'll debate
 by what safe means the crown may be recover'd
montague what talk you of debating in few words
 if you'll not here proclaim yourself our king
 i'll leave you to your fortune and be gone
 to keep them back that come to succor you
 why shall we fight if you pretend no title
gloucester why brother wherefore stand you on nice points
king edward iv when we grow stronger then we'll make our claim
 till then tis wisdom to conceal our meaning
hastings away with scrupulous wit now arms must rule
gloucester and fearless minds climb soonest unto crowns
 brother we will proclaim you out of hand
 the bruit thereof will bring you many friends
king edward iv then be it as you will for tis my right
 and henry but usurps the diadem
montague ay now my sovereign speaketh like himself
 and now will i be edward's champion
hastings sound trumpet edward shall be here proclaim'd
 come fellowsoldier make thou proclamation
 flourish
soldier edward the fourth by the grace of god king of
 england and france and lord of ireland &c
montague and whosoe'er gainsays king edward's right
 by this i challenge him to single fight
 throws down his gauntlet
all long live edward the fourth
king edward iv thanks brave montgomery and thanks unto you all
 if fortune serve me i'll requite this kindness
 now for this night let's harbour here in york
 and when the morning sun shall raise his car
 above the border of this horizon
 we'll forward towards warwick and his mates
 for well i wot that henry is no soldier
 ah froward clarence how evil it beseems thee
 to flatter henry and forsake thy brother
 yet as we may we'll meet both thee and warwick
 come on brave soldiers doubt not of the day
 and that once gotten doubt not of large pay

act iv
scene viii london the palace
 flourish enter king henry vi warwick montague
 clarence exeter and oxford
warwick what counsel lords edward from belgia
 with hasty germans and blunt hollanders
 hath pass'd in safety through the narrow seas
 and with his troops doth march amain to london
 and many giddy people flock to him
king henry vi let's levy men and beat him back again
clarence a little fire is quickly trodden out
 which being suffer'd rivers cannot quench
warwick in warwickshire i have truehearted friends
 not mutinous in peace yet bold in war
 those will i muster up and thou son clarence
 shalt stir up in suffolk norfolk and in kent
 the knights and gentlemen to come with thee
 thou brother montague in buckingham
 northampton and in leicestershire shalt find
 men well inclined to hear what thou command'st
 and thou brave oxford wondrous well beloved
 in oxfordshire shalt muster up thy friends
 my sovereign with the loving citizens
 like to his island girt in with the ocean
 or modest dian circled with her nymphs
 shall rest in london till we come to him
 fair lords take leave and stand not to reply
 farewell my sovereign
king henry vi farewell my hector and my troy's true hope
clarence in sign of truth i kiss your highness hand
king henry vi wellminded clarence be thou fortunate
montague comfort my lord and so i take my leave
oxford and thus i seal my truth and bid adieu
king henry vi sweet oxford and my loving montague
 and all at once once more a happy farewell
warwick farewell sweet lords let's meet at coventry
 exeunt all but king henry vi and exeter
king henry vi here at the palace i will rest awhile
 cousin of exeter what thinks your lordship
 methinks the power that edward hath in field
 should not be able to encounter mine
exeter the doubt is that he will seduce the rest
king henry vi that's not my fear my meed hath got me fame
 i have not stopp'd mine ears to their demands
 nor posted off their suits with slow delays
 my pity hath been balm to heal their wounds
 my mildness hath allay'd their swelling griefs
 my mercy dried their waterflowing tears
 i have not been desirous of their wealth
 nor much oppress'd them with great subsidies
 nor forward of revenge though they much err'd
 then why should they love edward more than me
 no exeter these graces challenge grace
 and when the lion fawns upon the lamb
 the lamb will never cease to follow him
 shout within a lancaster a lancaster'
exeter hark hark my lord what shouts are these
 enter king edward iv gloucester and soldiers
king edward iv seize on the shamefaced henry bear him hence
 and once again proclaim us king of england
 you are the fount that makes small brooks to flow
 now stops thy spring my sea sha$l suck them dry
 and swell so much the higher by their ebb
 hence with him to the tower let him not speak
 exeunt some with king henry vi
 and lords towards coventry bend we our course
 where peremptory warwick now remains
 the sun shines hot and if we use delay
 cold biting winter mars our hopedfor hay
gloucester away betimes before his forces join
 and take the greatgrown traitor unawares
 brave warriors march amain towards coventry
 exeunt
 3 king henry vi
act v
scene i coventry
 enter warwick the mayor of coventry two messengers
 and others upon the walls
warwick where is the post that came from valiant oxford
 how far hence is thy lord mine honest fellow
first messenger by this at dunsmore marching hitherward
warwick how far off is our brother montague
 where is the post that came from montague
second messenger by this at daintry with a puissant troop
 enter sir john somerville
warwick say somerville what says my loving son
 and by thy guess how nigh is clarence now
somerset at southam i did leave him with his forces
 and do expect him here some two hours hence
 drum heard
warwick then clarence is at hand i hear his drum
somerset it is not his my lord here southam lies
 the drum your honour hears marcheth from warwick
warwick who should that be belike unlook'dfor friends
somerset they are at hand and you shall quickly know
 march flourish enter king edward iv gloucester
 and soldiers
king edward iv go trumpet to the walls and sound a parle
gloucester see how the surly warwick mans the wall
warwick o unbid spite is sportful edward come
 where slept our scouts or how are they seduced
 that we could hear no news of his repair
king edward iv now warwick wilt thou ope the city gates
 speak gentle words and humbly bend thy knee
 call edward king and at his hands beg mercy
 and he shall pardon thee these outrages
warwick nay rather wilt thou draw thy forces hence
 confess who set thee up and pluck'd thee own
 call warwick patron and be penitent
 and thou shalt still remain the duke of york
gloucester i thought at least he would have said the king
 or did he make the jest against his will
warwick is not a dukedom sir a goodly gift
gloucester ay by my faith for a poor earl to give
 i'll do thee service for so good a gift
warwick twas i that gave the kingdom to thy brother
king edward iv why then tis mine if but by warwick's gift
warwick thou art no atlas for so great a weight
 and weakling warwick takes his gift again
 and henry is my king warwick his subject
king edward iv but warwick's king is edward's prisoner
 and gallant warwick do but answer this
 what is the body when the head is off
gloucester alas that warwick had no more forecast
 but whiles he thought to steal the single ten
 the king was slily finger'd from the deck
 you left poor henry at the bishop's palace
 and ten to one you'll meet him in the tower
