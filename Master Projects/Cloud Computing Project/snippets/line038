1sm163 and call jesse to the sacrifice and i will shew thee what thou shalt do and thou shalt anoint unto me him whom i name unto thee
1sm164 and samuel did that which the lord spake and came to bethlehem and the elders of the town trembled at his coming and said comest thou peaceably
1sm165 and he said peaceably i am come to sacrifice unto the lord sanctify yourselves and come with me to the sacrifice and he sanctified jesse and his sons and called them to the sacrifice
1sm166 and it came to pass when they were come that he looked on eliab and said surely the lord's anointed is before him
1sm167 but the lord said unto samuel look not on his countenance or on the height of his stature because i have refused him for the lord seeth not as man seeth for man looketh on the outward appearance but the lord looketh on the heart
1sm168 then jesse called abinadab and made him pass before samuel and he said neither hath the lord chosen this
1sm169 then jesse made shammah to pass by and he said neither hath the lord chosen this
1sm1610 again jesse made seven of his sons to pass before samuel and samuel said unto jesse the lord hath not chosen these
1sm1611 and samuel said unto jesse are here all thy children and he said there remaineth yet the youngest and behold he keepeth the sheep and samuel said unto jesse send and fetch him for we will not sit down till he come hither
1sm1612 and he sent and brought him in now he was ruddy and withal of a beautiful countenance and goodly to look to and the lord said arise anoint him for this is he
1sm1613 then samuel took the horn of oil and anointed him in the midst of his brethren and the spirit of the lord came upon david from that day forward so samuel rose up and went to ramah
1sm1614 but the spirit of the lord departed from saul and an evil spirit from the lord troubled him
1sm1615 and saul's servants said unto him behold now an evil spirit from god troubleth thee
1sm1616 let our lord now command thy servants which are before thee to seek out a man who is a cunning player on an harp and it shall come to pass when the evil spirit from god is upon thee that he shall play with his hand and thou shalt be well
1sm1617 and saul said unto his servants provide me now a man that can play well and bring him to me
1sm1618 then answered one of the servants and said behold i have seen a son of jesse the bethlehemite that is cunning in playing and a mighty valiant man and a man of war and prudent in matters and a comely person and the lord is with him
1sm1619 wherefore saul sent messengers unto jesse and said send me david thy son which is with the sheep
1sm1620 and jesse took an ass laden with bread and a bottle of wine and a kid and sent them by david his son unto saul
1sm1621 and david came to saul and stood before him and he loved him greatly and he became his armourbearer
1sm1622 and saul sent to jesse saying let david i pray thee stand before me for he hath found favour in my sight
1sm1623 and it came to pass when the evil spirit from god was upon saul that david took an harp and played with his hand so saul was refreshed and was well and the evil spirit departed from him
1sm171 now the philistines gathered together their armies to battle and were gathered together at shochoh which belongeth to judah and pitched between shochoh and azekah in ephesdammim
1sm172 and saul and the men of israel were gathered together and pitched by the valley of elah and set the battle in array against the philistines
1sm173 and the philistines stood on a mountain on the one side and israel stood on a mountain on the other side and there was a valley between them
1sm174 and there went out a champion out of the camp of the philistines named goliath of gath whose height was six cubits and a span
1sm175 and he had an helmet of brass upon his head and he was armed with a coat of mail and the weight of the coat was five thousand shekels of brass
1sm176 and he had greaves of brass upon his legs and a target of brass between his shoulders
1sm177 and the staff of his spear was like a weaver's beam and his spear's head weighed six hundred shekels of iron and one bearing a shield went before him
1sm178 and he stood and cried unto the armies of israel and said unto them why are ye come out to set your battle in array am not i a philistine and ye servants to saul choose you a man for you and let him come down to me
1sm179 if he be able to fight with me and to kill me then will we be your servants but if i prevail against him and kill him then shall ye be our servants and serve us
1sm1710 and the philistine said i defy the armies of israel this day give me a man that we may fight together
1sm1711 when saul and all israel heard those words of the philistine they were dismayed and greatly afraid
1sm1712 now david was the son of that ephrathite of bethlehemjudah whose name was jesse and he had eight sons and the man went among men for an old man in the days of saul
1sm1713 and the three eldest sons of jesse went and followed saul to the battle and the names of his three sons that went to the battle were eliab the firstborn and next unto him abinadab and the third shammah
1sm1714 and david was the youngest and the three eldest followed saul
1sm1715 but david went and returned from saul to feed his father's sheep at bethlehem
1sm1716 and the philistine drew near morning and evening and presented himself forty days
1sm1717 and jesse said unto david his son take now for thy brethren an ephah of this parched corn and these ten loaves and run to the camp to thy brethren
1sm1718 and carry these ten cheeses unto the captain of their thousand and look how thy brethren fare and take their pledge
1sm1719 now saul and they and all the men of israel were in the valley of elah fighting with the philistines
1sm1720 and david rose up early in the morning and left the sheep with a keeper and took and went as jesse had commanded him and he came to the trench as the host was going forth to the fight and shouted for the battle
1sm1721 for israel and the philistines had put the battle in array army against army
1sm1722 and david left his carriage in the hand of the keeper of the carriage and ran into the army and came and saluted his brethren
1sm1723 and as he talked with them behold there came up the champion the philistine of gath goliath by name out of the armies of the philistines and spake according to the same words and david heard them
1sm1724 and all the men of israel when they saw the man fled from him and were sore afraid
1sm1725 and the men of israel said have ye seen this man that is come up surely to defy israel is he come up and it shall be that the man who killeth him the king will enrich him with great riches and will give him his daughter and make his father's house free in israel
1sm1726 and david spake to the men that stood by him saying what shall be done to the man that killeth this philistine and taketh away the reproach from israel for who is this uncircumcised philistine that he should defy the armies of the living god
1sm1727 and the people answered him after this manner saying so shall it be done to the man that killeth him
1sm1728 and eliab his eldest brother heard when he spake unto the men and eliab's anger was kindled against david and he said why camest thou down hither and with whom hast thou left those few sheep in the wilderness i know thy pride and the naughtiness of thine heart for thou art come down that thou mightest see the battle
1sm1729 and david said what have i now done is there not a cause
1sm1730 and he turned from him toward another and spake after the same manner and the people answered him again after the former manner
1sm1731 and when the words were heard which david spake they rehearsed them before saul and he sent for him
1sm1732 and david said to saul let no man's heart fail because of him thy servant will go and fight with this philistine
1sm1733 and saul said to david thou art not able to go against this philistine to fight with him for thou art but a youth and he a man of war from his youth
1sm1734 and david said unto saul thy servant kept his father's sheep and there came a lion and a bear and took a lamb out of the flock
1sm1735 and i went out after him and smote him and delivered it out of his mouth and when he arose against me i caught him by his beard and smote him and slew him
1sm1736 thy servant slew both the lion and the bear and this uncircumcised philistine shall be as one of them seeing he hath defied the armies of the living god
1sm1737 david said moreover the lord that delivered me out of the paw of the lion and out of the paw of the bear he will deliver me out of the hand of this philistine and saul said unto david go and the lord be with thee
1sm1738 and saul armed david with his armour and he put an helmet of brass upon his head also he armed him with a coat of mail
1sm1739 and david girded his sword upon his armour and he assayed to go for he had not proved it and david said unto saul i cannot go with these for i have not proved them and david put them off him
1sm1740 and he took his staff in his hand and chose him five smooth stones out of the brook and put them in a shepherd's bag which he had even in a scrip and his sling was in his hand and he drew near to the philistine
1sm1741 and the philistine came on and drew near unto david and the man that bare the shield went before him
1sm1742 and when the philistine looked about and saw david he disdained him for he was but a youth and ruddy and of a fair countenance
1sm1743 and the philistine said unto david am i a dog that thou comest to me with staves and the philistine cursed david by his gods
1sm1744 and the philistine said to david come to me and i will give thy flesh unto the fowls of the air and to the beasts of the field
1sm1745 then said david to the philistine thou comest to me with a sword and with a spear and with a shield but i come to thee in the name of the lord of hosts the god of the armies of israel whom thou hast defied
1sm1746 this day will the lord deliver thee into mine hand and i will smite thee and take thine head from thee and i will give the carcases of the host of the philistines this day unto the fowls of the air and to the wild beasts of the earth that all the earth may know that there is a god in israel
1sm1747 and all this assembly shall know that the lord saveth not with sword and spear for the battle is the lord's and he will give you into our hands
1sm1748 and it came to pass when the philistine arose and came and drew nigh to meet david that david hastened and ran toward the army to meet the philistine
1sm1749 and david put his hand in his bag and took thence a stone and slang it and smote the philistine in his forehead that the stone sunk into his forehead and he fell upon his face to the earth
1sm1750 so david prevailed over the philistine with a sling and with a stone and smote the philistine and slew him but there was no sword in the hand of david
1sm1751 therefore david ran and stood upon the philistine and took his sword and drew it out of the sheath thereof and slew him and cut off his head therewith and when the philistines saw their champion was dead they fled
1sm1752 and the men of israel and of judah arose and shouted and pursued the philistines until thou come to the valley and to the gates of ekron and the wounded of the philistines fell down by the way to shaaraim even unto gath and unto ekron
1sm1753 and the children of israel returned from chasing after the philistines and they spoiled their tents
1sm1754 and david took the head of the philistine and brought it to jerusalem but he put his armour in his tent
1sm1755 and when saul saw david go forth against the philistine he said unto abner the captain of the host abner whose son is this youth and abner said as thy soul liveth o king i cannot tell
1sm1756 and the king said enquire thou whose son the stripling is
1sm1757 and as david returned from the slaughter of the philistine abner took him and brought him before saul with the head of the philistine in his hand
1sm1758 and saul said to him whose son art thou thou young man and david answered i am the son of thy servant jesse the bethlehemite
1sm181 and it came to pass when he had made an end of speaking unto saul that the soul of jonathan was knit with the soul of david and jonathan loved him as his own soul
1sm182 and saul took him that day and would let him go no more home to his father's house
1sm183 then jonathan and david made a covenant because he loved him as his own soul
1sm184 and jonathan stripped himself of the robe that was upon him and gave it to david and his garments even to his sword and to his bow and to his girdle
1sm185 and david went out whithersoever saul sent him and behaved himself wisely and saul set him over the men of war and he was accepted in the sight of all the people and also in the sight of saul's servants
1sm186 and it came to pass as they came when david was returned from the slaughter of the philistine that the women came out of all cities of israel singing and dancing to meet king saul with tabrets with joy and with instruments of musick
1sm187 and the women answered one another as they played and said saul hath slain his thousands and david his ten thousands
1sm188 and saul was very wroth and the saying displeased him and he said they have ascribed unto david ten thousands and to me they have ascribed but thousands and what can he have more but the kingdom
1sm189 and saul eyed david from that day and forward
1sm1810 and it came to pass on the morrow that the evil spirit from god came upon saul and he prophesied in the midst of the house and david played with his hand as at other times and there was a javelin in saul's hand
1sm1811 and saul cast the javelin for he said i will smite david even to the wall with it and david avoided out of his presence twice
1sm1812 and saul was afraid of david because the lord was with him and was departed from saul
1sm1813 therefore saul removed him from him and made him his captain over a thousand and he went out and came in before the people
1sm1814 and david behaved himself wisely in all his ways and the lord was with him
1sm1815 wherefore when saul saw that he behaved himself very wisely he was afraid of him
1sm1816 but all israel and judah loved david because he went out and came in before them
1sm1817 and saul said to david behold my elder daughter merab her will i give thee to wife only be thou valiant for me and fight the lord's battles for saul said let not mine hand be upon him but let the hand of the philistines be upon him
1sm1818 and david said unto saul who am i and what is my life or my father's family in israel that i should be son in law to the king
1sm1819 but it came to pass at the time when merab saul's daughter should have been given to david that she was given unto adriel the meholathite to wife
1sm1820 and michal saul's daughter loved david and they told saul and the thing pleased him
1sm1821 and saul said i will give him her that she may be a snare to him and that the hand of the philistines may be against him wherefore saul said to david thou shalt this day be my son in law in the one of the twain
1sm1822 and saul commanded his servants saying commune with david secretly and say behold the king hath delight in thee and all his servants love thee now therefore be the king's son in law
1sm1823 and saul's servants spake those words in the ears of david and david said seemeth it to you a light thing to be a king's son in law seeing that i am a poor man and lightly esteemed
1sm1824 and the servants of saul told him saying on this manner spake david
1sm1825 and saul said thus shall ye say to david the king desireth not any dowry but an hundred foreskins of the philistines to be avenged of the king's enemies but saul thought to make david fall by the hand of the philistines
1sm1826 and when his servants told david these words it pleased david well to be the king's son in law and the days were not expired
1sm1827 wherefore david arose and went he and his men and slew of the philistines two hundred men and david brought their foreskins and they gave them in full tale to the king that he might be the king's son in law and saul gave him michal his daughter to wife
1sm1828 and saul saw and knew that the lord was with david and that michal saul's daughter loved him
1sm1829 and saul was yet the more afraid of david and saul became david's enemy continually
1sm1830 then the princes of the philistines went forth and it came to pass after they went forth that david behaved himself more wisely than all the servants of saul so that his name was much set by
1sm191 and saul spake to jonathan his son and to all his servants that they should kill david
1sm192 but jonathan saul's son delighted much in david and jonathan told david saying saul my father seeketh to kill thee now therefore i pray thee take heed to thyself until the morning and abide in a secret place and hide thyself
1sm193 and i will go out and stand beside my father in the field where thou art and i will commune with my father of thee and what i see that i will tell thee
1sm194 and jonathan spake good of david unto saul his father and said unto him let not the king sin against his servant against david because he hath not sinned against thee and because his works have been to theeward very good
1sm195 for he did put his life in his hand and slew the philistine and the lord wrought a great salvation for all israel thou sawest it and didst rejoice wherefore then wilt thou sin against innocent blood to slay david without a cause
1sm196 and saul hearkened unto the voice of jonathan and saul sware as the lord liveth he shall not be slain
1sm197 and jonathan called david and jonathan shewed him all those things and jonathan brought david to saul and he was in his presence as in times past
1sm198 and there was war again and david went out and fought with the philistines and slew them with a great slaughter and they fled from him
1sm199 and the evil spirit from the lord was upon saul as he sat in his house with his javelin in his hand and david played with his hand
1sm1910 and saul sought to smite david even to the wall with the javelin but he slipped away out of saul's presence and he smote the javelin into the wall and david fled and escaped that night
1sm1911 saul also sent messengers unto david's house to watch him and to slay him in the morning and michal david's wife told him saying if thou save not thy life to night to morrow thou shalt be slain
1sm1912 so michal let david down through a window and he went and fled and escaped
1sm1913 and michal took an image and laid it in the bed and put a pillow of goats hair for his bolster and covered it with a cloth
1sm1914 and when saul sent messengers to take david she said he is sick
1sm1915 and saul sent the messengers again to see david saying bring him up to me in the bed that i may slay him
1sm1916 and when the messengers were come in behold there was an image in the bed with a pillow of goats hair for his bolster
1sm1917 and saul said unto michal why hast thou deceived me so and sent away mine enemy that he is escaped and michal answered saul he said unto me let me go why should i kill thee
1sm1918 so david fled and escaped and came to samuel to ramah and told him all that saul had done to him and he and samuel went and dwelt in naioth
1sm1919 and it was told saul saying behold david is at naioth in ramah
1sm1920 and saul sent messengers to take david and when they saw the company of the prophets prophesying and samuel standing as appointed over them the spirit of god was upon the messengers of saul and they also prophesied
1sm1921 and when it was told saul he sent other messengers and they prophesied likewise and saul sent messengers again the third time and they prophesied also
1sm1922 then went he also to ramah and came to a great well that is in sechu and he asked and said where are samuel and david and one said behold they be at naioth in ramah
1sm1923 and he went thither to naioth in ramah and the spirit of god was upon him also and he went on and prophesied until he came to naioth in ramah
1sm1924 and he stripped off his clothes also and prophesied before samuel in like manner and lay down naked all that day and all that night wherefore they say is saul also among the prophets
1sm201 and david fled from naioth in ramah and came and said before jonathan what have i done what is mine iniquity and what is my sin before thy father that he seeketh my life
1sm202 and he said unto him god forbid thou shalt not die behold my father will do nothing either great or small but that he will shew it me and why should my father hide this thing from me it is not so
1sm203 and david sware moreover and said thy father certainly knoweth that i have found grace in thine eyes and he saith let not jonathan know this lest he be grieved but truly as the lord liveth and as thy soul liveth there is but a step between me and death
1sm204 then said jonathan unto david whatsoever thy soul desireth i will even do it for thee
1sm205 and david said unto jonathan behold to morrow is the new moon and i should not fail to sit with the king at meat but let me go that i may hide myself in the field unto the third day at even
1sm206 if thy father at all miss me then say david earnestly asked leave of me that he might run to bethlehem his city for there is a yearly sacrifice there for all the family
1sm207 if he say thus it is well thy servant shall have peace but if he be very wroth then be sure that evil is determined by him
1sm208 therefore thou shalt deal kindly with thy servant for thou hast brought thy servant into a covenant of the lord with thee notwithstanding if there be in me iniquity slay me thyself for why shouldest thou bring me to thy father
1sm209 and jonathan said far be it from thee for if i knew certainly that evil were determined by my father to come upon thee then would not i tell it thee
1sm2010 then said david to jonathan who shall tell me or what if thy father answer thee roughly
1sm2011 and jonathan said unto david come and let us go out into the field and they went out both of them into the field
1sm2012 and jonathan said unto david o lord god of israel when i have sounded my father about to morrow any time or the third day and behold if there be good toward david and i then send not unto thee and shew it thee
1sm2013 the lord do so and much more to jonathan but if it please my father to do thee evil then i will shew it thee and send thee away that thou mayest go in peace and the lord be with thee as he hath been with my father
1sm2014 and thou shalt not only while yet i live shew me the kindness of the lord that i die not
1sm2015 but also thou shalt not cut off thy kindness from my house for ever no not when the lord hath cut off the enemies of david every one from the face of the earth
1sm2016 so jonathan made a covenant with the house of david saying let the lord even require it at the hand of david's enemies
1sm2017 and jonathan caused david to swear again because he loved him for he loved him as he loved his own soul
1sm2018 then jonathan said to david to morrow is the new moon and thou shalt be missed because thy seat will be empty
1sm2019 and when thou hast stayed three days then thou shalt go down quickly and come to the place where thou didst hide thyself when the business was in hand and shalt remain by the stone ezel
1sm2020 and i will shoot three arrows on the side thereof as though i shot at a mark
1sm2021 and behold i will send a lad saying go find out the arrows if i expressly say unto the lad behold the arrows are on this side of thee take them then come thou for there is peace to thee and no hurt as the lord liveth
1sm2022 but if i say thus unto the young man behold the arrows are beyond thee go thy way for the lord hath sent thee away
1sm2023 and as touching the matter which thou and i have spoken of behold the lord be between thee and me for ever
1sm2024 so david hid himself in the field and when the new moon was come the king sat him down to eat meat
1sm2025 and the king sat upon his seat as at other times even upon a seat by the wall and jonathan arose and abner sat by saul's side and david's place was empty
1sm2026 nevertheless saul spake not any thing that day for he thought something hath befallen him he is not clean surely he is not clean
1sm2027 and it came to pass on the morrow which was the second day of the month that david's place was empty and saul said unto jonathan his son wherefore cometh not the son of jesse to meat neither yesterday nor to day
1sm2028 and jonathan answered saul david earnestly asked leave of me to go to bethlehem
1sm2029 and he said let me go i pray thee for our family hath a sacrifice in the city and my brother he hath commanded me to be there and now if i have found favour in thine eyes let me get away i pray thee and see my brethren therefore he cometh not unto the king's table
1sm2030 then saul's anger was kindled against jonathan and he said unto him thou son of the perverse rebellious woman do not i know that thou hast chosen the son of jesse to thine own confusion and unto the confusion of thy mother's nakedness
1sm2031 for as long as the son of jesse liveth upon the ground thou shalt not be established nor thy kingdom wherefore now send and fetch him unto me for he shall surely die
1sm2032 and jonathan answered saul his father and said unto him wherefore shall he be slain what hath he done
1sm2033 and saul cast a javelin at him to smite him whereby jonathan knew that it was determined of his father to slay david
1sm2034 so jonathan arose from the table in fierce anger and did eat no meat the second day of the month for he was grieved for david because his father had done him shame
1sm2035 and it came to pass in the morning that jonathan went out into the field at the time appointed with david and a little lad with him
1sm2036 and he said unto his lad run find out now the arrows which i shoot and as the lad ran he shot an arrow beyond him
1sm2037 and when the lad was come to the place of the arrow which jonathan had shot jonathan cried after the lad and said is not the arrow beyond thee
1sm2038 and jonathan cried after the lad make speed haste stay not and jonathan's lad gathered up the arrows and came to his master
1sm2039 but the lad knew not any thing only jonathan and david knew the matter
1sm2040 and jonathan gave his artillery unto his lad and said unto him go carry them to the city
1sm2041 and as soon as the lad was gone david arose out of a place toward the south and fell on his face to the ground and bowed himself three times and they kissed one another and wept one with another until david exceeded
1sm2042 and jonathan said to david go in peace forasmuch as we have sworn both of us in the name of the lord saying the lord be between me and thee and between my seed and thy seed for ever and he arose and departed and jonathan went into the city
1sm211 then came david to nob to ahimelech the priest and ahimelech was afraid at the meeting of david and said unto him why art thou alone and no man with thee
1sm212 and david said unto ahimelech the priest the king hath commanded me a business and hath said unto me let no man know any thing of the business whereabout i send thee and what i have commanded thee and i have appointed my servants to such and such a place
1sm213 now therefore what is under thine hand give me five loaves of bread in mine hand or what there is present
1sm214 and the priest answered david and said there is no common bread under mine hand but there is hallowed bread if the young men have kept themselves at least from women
1sm215 and david answered the priest and said unto him of a truth women have been kept from us about these three days since i came out and the vessels of the young men are holy and the bread is in a manner common yea though it were sanctified this day in the vessel
1sm216 so the priest gave him hallowed bread for there was no bread there but the shewbread that was taken from before the lord to put hot bread in the day when it was taken away
1sm217 now a certain man of the servants of saul was there that day detained before the lord and his name was doeg an edomite the chiefest of the herdmen that belonged to saul
1sm218 and david said unto ahimelech and is there not here under thine hand spear or sword for i have neither brought my sword nor my weapons with me because the king's business required haste
1sm219 and the priest said the sword of goliath the philistine whom thou slewest in the valley of elah behold it is here wrapped in a cloth behind the ephod if thou wilt take that take it for there is no other save that here and david said there is none like that give it me
1sm2110 and david arose and fled that day for fear of saul and went to achish the king of gath
1sm2111 and the servants of achish said unto him is not this david the king of the land did they not sing one to another of him in dances saying saul hath slain his thousands and david his ten thousands
1sm2112 and david laid up these words in his heart and was sore afraid of achish the king of gath
1sm2113 and he changed his behaviour before them and feigned himself mad in their hands and scrabbled on the doors of the gate and let his spittle fall down upon his beard
1sm2114 then said achish unto his servants lo ye see the man is mad wherefore then have ye brought him to me
1sm2115 have i need of mad men that ye have brought this fellow to play the mad man in my presence shall this fellow come into my house
1sm221 david therefore departed thence and escaped to the cave adullam and when his brethren and all his father's house heard it they went down thither to him
1sm222 and every one that was in distress and every one that was in debt and every one that was discontented gathered themselves unto him and he became a captain over them and there were with him about four hundred men
1sm223 and david went thence to mizpeh of moab and he said unto the king of moab let my father and my mother i pray thee come forth and be with you till i know what god will do for me
1sm224 and he brought them before the king of moab and they dwelt with him all the while that david was in the hold
1sm225 and the prophet gad said unto david abide not in the hold depart and get thee into the land of judah then david departed and came into the forest of hareth
1sm226 when saul heard that david was discovered and the men that were with him now saul abode in gibeah under a tree in ramah having his spear in his hand and all his servants were standing about him
