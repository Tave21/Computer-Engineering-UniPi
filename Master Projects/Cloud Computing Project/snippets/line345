how careful was i when i took my way
each trifle under truest bars to thrust
that to my use it might unused stay
from hands of falsehood in sure wards of trust
but thou to whom my jewels trifles are
most worthy of comfort now my greatest grief
thou best of dearest and mine only care
art left the prey of every vulgar thief
thee have i not lock'd up in any chest
save where thou art not though i feel thou art
within the gentle closure of my breast
from whence at pleasure thou mayst come and part
 and even thence thou wilt be stol'n i fear
 for truth proves thievish for a prize so dear
xlix
against that time if ever that time come
when i shall see thee frown on my defects
when as thy love hath cast his utmost sum
call'd to that audit by advised respects
against that time when thou shalt strangely pass
and scarcely greet me with that sun thine eye
when love converted from the thing it was
shall reasons find of settled gravity
against that time do i ensconce me here
within the knowledge of mine own desert
and this my hand against myself uprear
to guard the lawful reasons on thy part
 to leave poor me thou hast the strength of laws
 since why to love i can allege no cause
l
how heavy do i journey on the way
when what i seek my weary travel's end
doth teach that ease and that repose to say
'thus far the miles are measured from thy friend'
the beast that bears me tired with my woe
plods dully on to bear that weight in me
as if by some instinct the wretch did know
his rider loved not speed being made from thee
the bloody spur cannot provoke him on
that sometimes anger thrusts into his hide
which heavily he answers with a groan
more sharp to me than spurring to his side
 for that same groan doth put this in my mind
 my grief lies onward and my joy behind
li
thus can my love excuse the slow offence
of my dull bearer when from thee i speed
from where thou art why should i haste me thence
till i return of posting is no need
o what excuse will my poor beast then find
when swift extremity can seem but slow
then should i spur though mounted on the wind
in winged speed no motion shall i know
then can no horse with my desire keep pace
therefore desire of perfect'st love being made
shall neighno dull fleshin his fiery race
but love for love thus shall excuse my jade
 since from thee going he went wilfulslow
 towards thee i'll run and give him leave to go
lii
so am i as the rich whose blessed key
can bring him to his sweet uplocked treasure
the which he will not every hour survey
for blunting the fine point of seldom pleasure
therefore are feasts so solemn and so rare
since seldom coming in the long year set
like stones of worth they thinly placed are
or captain jewels in the carcanet
so is the time that keeps you as my chest
or as the wardrobe which the robe doth hide
to make some special instant special blest
by new unfolding his imprison'd pride
 blessed are you whose worthiness gives scope
 being had to triumph being lack'd to hope
liii
what is your substance whereof are you made
that millions of strange shadows on you tend
since every one hath every one one shade
and you but one can every shadow lend
describe adonis and the counterfeit
is poorly imitated after you
on helen's cheek all art of beauty set
and you in grecian tires are painted new
speak of the spring and foison of the year
the one doth shadow of your beauty show
the other as your bounty doth appear
and you in every blessed shape we know
 in all external grace you have some part
 but you like none none you for constant heart
liv
o how much more doth beauty beauteous seem
by that sweet ornament which truth doth give
the rose looks fair but fairer we it deem
for that sweet odour which doth in it live
the cankerblooms have full as deep a dye
as the perfumed tincture of the roses
hang on such thorns and play as wantonly
when summer's breath their masked buds discloses
but for their virtue only is their show
they live unwoo'd and unrespected fade
die to themselves sweet roses do not so
of their sweet deaths are sweetest odours made
 and so of you beauteous and lovely youth
 when that shall fade my verse distills your truth
lv
not marble nor the gilded monuments
of princes shall outlive this powerful rhyme
but you shall shine more bright in these contents
than unswept stone besmear'd with sluttish time
when wasteful war shall statues overturn
and broils root out the work of masonry
nor mars his sword nor war's quick fire shall burn
the living record of your memory
'gainst death and alloblivious enmity
shall you pace forth your praise shall still find room
even in the eyes of all posterity
that wear this world out to the ending doom
 so till the judgment that yourself arise
 you live in this and dwell in lover's eyes
lvi
sweet love renew thy force be it not said
thy edge should blunter be than appetite
which but today by feeding is allay'd
tomorrow sharpen'd in his former might
so love be thou although today thou fill
thy hungry eyes even till they wink with fullness
tomorrow see again and do not kill
the spirit of love with a perpetual dullness
let this sad interim like the ocean be
which parts the shore where two contracted new
come daily to the banks that when they see
return of love more blest may be the view
 else call it winter which being full of care
 makes summer's welcome thrice more wish'd more rare
lvii
being your slave what should i do but tend
upon the hours and times of your desire
i have no precious time at all to spend
nor services to do till you require
nor dare i chide the worldwithoutend hour
whilst i my sovereign watch the clock for you
nor think the bitterness of absence sour
when you have bid your servant once adieu
nor dare i question with my jealous thought
where you may be or your affairs suppose
but like a sad slave stay and think of nought
save where you are how happy you make those
 so true a fool is love that in your will
 though you do any thing he thinks no ill
lviii
that god forbid that made me first your slave
i should in thought control your times of pleasure
or at your hand the account of hours to crave
being your vassal bound to stay your leisure
o let me suffer being at your beck
the imprison'd absence of your liberty
and patience tame to sufferance bide each cheque
without accusing you of injury
be where you list your charter is so strong
that you yourself may privilege your time
to what you will to you it doth belong
yourself to pardon of selfdoing crime
 i am to wait though waiting so be hell
 not blame your pleasure be it ill or well
lix
if there be nothing new but that which is
hath been before how are our brains beguiled
which labouring for invention bear amiss
the second burden of a former child
o that record could with a backward look
even of five hundred courses of the sun
show me your image in some antique book
since mind at first in character was done
that i might see what the old world could say
to this composed wonder of your frame
whether we are mended or whether better they
or whether revolution be the same
 o sure i am the wits of former days
 to subjects worse have given admiring praise
lx
like as the waves make towards the pebbled shore
so do our minutes hasten to their end
each changing place with that which goes before
in sequent toil all forwards do contend
nativity once in the main of light
crawls to maturity wherewith being crown'd
crooked elipses gainst his glory fight
and time that gave doth now his gift confound
time doth transfix the flourish set on youth
and delves the parallels in beauty's brow
feeds on the rarities of nature's truth
and nothing stands but for his scythe to mow
 and yet to times in hope my verse shall stand
 praising thy worth despite his cruel hand
lxi
is it thy will thy image should keep open
my heavy eyelids to the weary night
dost thou desire my slumbers should be broken
while shadows like to thee do mock my sight
is it thy spirit that thou send'st from thee
