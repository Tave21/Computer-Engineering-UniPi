the lord god of heaven which took me from my father's house and from the land of my kindred and which spake unto me and that sware unto me saying unto thy seed will i give this land he shall send his angel before thee and thou shalt take a wife unto my son from thence
and if the woman will not be willing to follow thee then thou shalt be clear from this my oath only bring not my son thither again
and the servant put his hand under the thigh of abraham his master and sware to him concerning that matter
and the servant took ten camels of the camels of his master and departed for all the goods of his master were in his hand and he arose and went to mesopotamia unto the city of nahor
and he made his camels to kneel down without the city by a well of water at the time of the evening even the time that women go out to draw water
and he said o lord god of my master abraham i pray thee send me good speed this day and shew kindness unto my master abraham
behold i stand here by the well of water and the daughters of the men of the city come out to draw water
and let it come to pass that the damsel to whom i shall say let down thy pitcher i pray thee that i may drink and she shall say drink and i will give thy camels drink also let the same be she that thou hast appointed for thy servant isaac and thereby shall i know that thou hast shewed kindness unto my master
and it came to pass before he had done speaking that behold rebekah came out who was born to bethuel son of milcah the wife of nahor abraham's brother with her pitcher upon her shoulder
and the damsel was very fair to look upon a virgin neither had any man known her and she went down to the well and filled her pitcher and came up
and the servant ran to meet her and said let me i pray thee drink a little water of thy pitcher
and she said drink my lord and she hasted and let down her pitcher upon her hand and gave him drink
and when she had done giving him drink she said i will draw water for thy camels also until they have done drinking
and she hasted and emptied her pitcher into the trough and ran again unto the well to draw water and drew for all his camels
and the man wondering at her held his peace to wit whether the lord had made his journey prosperous or not
and it came to pass as the camels had done drinking that the man took a golden earring of half a shekel weight and two bracelets for her hands of ten shekels weight of gold
and said whose daughter art thou tell me i pray thee is there room in thy father's house for us to lodge in
and she said unto him i am the daughter of bethuel the son of milcah which she bare unto nahor
she said moreover unto him we have both straw and provender enough and room to lodge in
and the man bowed down his head and worshipped the lord
and he said blessed be the lord god of my master abraham who hath not left destitute my master of his mercy and his truth i being in the way the lord led me to the house of my master's brethren
and the damsel ran and told them of her mother's house these things
and rebekah had a brother and his name was laban and laban ran out unto the man unto the well
and it came to pass when he saw the earring and bracelets upon his sister's hands and when he heard the words of rebekah his sister saying thus spake the man unto me that he came unto the man and behold he stood by the camels at the well
and he said come in thou blessed of the lord wherefore standest thou without for i have prepared the house and room for the camels
and the man came into the house and he ungirded his camels and gave straw and provender for the camels and water to wash his feet and the men's feet that were with him
and there was set meat before him to eat but he said i will not eat until i have told mine errand and he said speak on
and he said i am abraham's servant
and the lord hath blessed my master greatly and he is become great and he hath given him flocks and herds and silver and gold and menservants and maidservants and camels and asses
and sarah my master's wife bare a son to my master when she was old and unto him hath he given all that he hath
and my master made me swear saying thou shalt not take a wife to my son of the daughters of the canaanites in whose land i dwell
but thou shalt go unto my father's house and to my kindred and take a wife unto my son
and i said unto my master peradventure the woman will not follow me
and he said unto me the lord before whom i walk will send his angel with thee and prosper thy way and thou shalt take a wife for my son of my kindred and of my father's house
then shalt thou be clear from this my oath when thou comest to my kindred and if they give not thee one thou shalt be clear from my oath
and i came this day unto the well and said o lord god of my master abraham if now thou do prosper my way which i go
behold i stand by the well of water and it shall come to pass that when the virgin cometh forth to draw water and i say to her give me i pray thee a little water of thy pitcher to drink
and she say to me both drink thou and i will also draw for thy camels let the same be the woman whom the lord hath appointed out for my master's son
and before i had done speaking in mine heart behold rebekah came forth with her pitcher on her shoulder and she went down unto the well and drew water and i said unto her let me drink i pray thee
and she made haste and let down her pitcher from her shoulder and said drink and i will give thy camels drink also so i drank and she made the camels drink also
and i asked her and said whose daughter art thou and she said the daughter of bethuel nahor's son whom milcah bare unto him and i put the earring upon her face and the bracelets upon her hands
and i bowed down my head and worshipped the lord and blessed the lord god of my master abraham which had led me in the right way to take my master's brother's daughter unto his son
and now if ye will deal kindly and truly with my master tell me and if not tell me that i may turn to the right hand or to the left
then laban and bethuel answered and said the thing proceedeth from the lord we cannot speak unto thee bad or good
behold rebekah is before thee take her and go and let her be thy master's son's wife as the lord hath spoken
and it came to pass that when abraham's servant heard their words he worshipped the lord bowing himself to the earth
and the servant brought forth jewels of silver and jewels of gold and raiment and gave them to rebekah he gave also to her brother and to her mother precious things
and they did eat and drink he and the men that were with him and tarried all night and they rose up in the morning and he said send me away unto my master
and her brother and her mother said let the damsel abide with us a few days at the least ten after that she shall go
and he said unto them hinder me not seeing the lord hath prospered my way send me away that i may go to my master
and they said we will call the damsel and enquire at her mouth
and they called rebekah and said unto her wilt thou go with this man and she said i will go
and they sent away rebekah their sister and her nurse and abraham's servant and his men
and they blessed rebekah and said unto her thou art our sister be thou the mother of thousands of millions and let thy seed possess the gate of those which hate them
and rebekah arose and her damsels and they rode upon the camels and followed the man and the servant took rebekah and went his way
and isaac came from the way of the well lahairoi for he dwelt in the south country
and isaac went out to meditate in the field at the eventide and he lifted up his eyes and saw and behold the camels were coming
and rebekah lifted up her eyes and when she saw isaac she lighted off the camel
for she had said unto the servant what man is this that walketh in the field to meet us and the servant had said it is my master therefore she took a vail and covered herself
and the servant told isaac all things that he had done
and isaac brought her into his mother sarah's tent and took rebekah and she became his wife and he loved her and isaac was comforted after his mother's death
then again abraham took a wife and her name was keturah
and she bare him zimran and jokshan and medan and midian and ishbak and shuah
and jokshan begat sheba and dedan and the sons of dedan were asshurim and letushim and leummim
and the sons of midian ephah and epher and hanoch and abidah and eldaah all these were the children of keturah
and abraham gave all that he had unto isaac
but unto the sons of the concubines which abraham had abraham gave gifts and sent them away from isaac his son while he yet lived eastward unto the east country
and these are the days of the years of abraham's life which he lived an hundred threescore and fifteen years
then abraham gave up the ghost and died in a good old age an old man and full of years and was gathered to his people
and his sons isaac and ishmael buried him in the cave of machpelah in the field of ephron the son of zohar the hittite which is before mamre
the field which abraham purchased of the sons of heth there was abraham buried and sarah his wife
and it came to pass after the death of abraham that god blessed his son isaac and isaac dwelt by the well lahairoi
now these are the generations of ishmael abraham's son whom hagar the egyptian sarah's handmaid bare unto abraham
and these are the names of the sons of ishmael by their names according to their generations the firstborn of ishmael nebajoth and kedar and adbeel and mibsam
and mishma and dumah and massa
hadar and tema jetur naphish and kedemah
these are the sons of ishmael and these are their names by their towns and by their castles twelve princes according to their nations
and these are the years of the life of ishmael an hundred and thirty and seven years and he gave up the ghost and died and was gathered unto his people
and they dwelt from havilah unto shur that is before egypt as thou goest toward assyria and he died in the presence of all his brethren
and these are the generations of isaac abraham's son abraham begat isaac
and isaac was forty years old when he took rebekah to wife the daughter of bethuel the syrian of padanaram the sister to laban the syrian
and isaac intreated the lord for his wife because she was barren and the lord was intreated of him and rebekah his wife conceived
and the children struggled together within her and she said if it be so why am i thus and she went to enquire of the lord
and the lord said unto her two nations are in thy womb and two manner of people shall be separated from thy bowels and the one people shall be stronger than the other people and the elder shall serve the younger
and when her days to be delivered were fulfilled behold there were twins in her womb
and the first came out red all over like an hairy garment and they called his name esau
and after that came his brother out and his hand took hold on esau's heel and his name was called jacob and isaac was threescore years old when she bare them
and the boys grew and esau was a cunning hunter a man of the field and jacob was a plain man dwelling in tents
and isaac loved esau because he did eat of his venison but rebekah loved jacob
and jacob sod pottage and esau came from the field and he was faint
and esau said to jacob feed me i pray thee with that same red pottage for i am faint therefore was his name called edom
and jacob said sell me this day thy birthright
and esau said behold i am at the point to die and what profit shall this birthright do to me
and jacob said swear to me this day and he sware unto him and he sold his birthright unto jacob
then jacob gave esau bread and pottage of lentiles and he did eat and drink and rose up and went his way thus esau despised his birthright
and there was a famine in the land beside the first famine that was in the days of abraham and isaac went unto abimelech king of the philistines unto gerar
and the lord appeared unto him and said go not down into egypt dwell in the land which i shall tell thee of
sojourn in this land and i will be with thee and will bless thee for unto thee and unto thy seed i will give all these countries and i will perform the oath which i sware unto abraham thy father
and i will make thy seed to multiply as the stars of heaven and will give unto thy seed all these countries and in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed
because that abraham obeyed my voice and kept my charge my commandments my statutes and my laws
and isaac dwelt in gerar
and the men of the place asked him of his wife and he said she is my sister for he feared to say she is my wife lest said he the men of the place should kill me for rebekah because she was fair to look upon
and it came to pass when he had been there a long time that abimelech king of the philistines looked out at a window and saw and behold isaac was sporting with rebekah his wife
and abimelech called isaac and said behold of a surety she is thy wife and how saidst thou she is my sister and isaac said unto him because i said lest i die for her
and abimelech said what is this thou hast done unto us one of the people might lightly have lien with thy wife and thou shouldest have brought guiltiness upon us
and abimelech charged all his people saying he that toucheth this man or his wife shall surely be put to death
then isaac sowed in that land and received in the same year an hundredfold and the lord blessed him
and the man waxed great and went forward and grew until he became very great
for he had possession of flocks and possession of herds and great store of servants and the philistines envied him
for all the wells which his father's servants had digged in the days of abraham his father the philistines had stopped them and filled them with earth
and abimelech said unto isaac go from us for thou art much mightier than we
and isaac departed thence and pitched his tent in the valley of gerar and dwelt there
and isaac digged again the wells of water which they had digged in the days of abraham his father for the philistines had stopped them after the death of abraham and he called their names after the names by which his father had called them
and isaac's servants digged in the valley and found there a well of springing water
and the herdmen of gerar did strive with isaac's herdmen saying the water is ours and he called the name of the well esek because they strove with him
and they digged another well and strove for that also and he called the name of it sitnah
and he removed from thence and digged another well and for that they strove not and he called the name of it rehoboth and he said for now the lord hath made room for us and we shall be fruitful in the land
and he went up from thence to beersheba
and the lord appeared unto him the same night and said i am the god of abraham thy father fear not for i am with thee and will bless thee and multiply thy seed for my servant abraham's sake
and he builded an altar there and called upon the name of the lord and pitched his tent there and there isaac's servants digged a well
then abimelech went to him from gerar and ahuzzath one of his friends and phichol the chief captain of his army
and isaac said unto them wherefore come ye to me seeing ye hate me and have sent me away from you
and they said we saw certainly that the lord was with thee and we said let there be now an oath betwixt us even betwixt us and thee and let us make a covenant with thee
that thou wilt do us no hurt as we have not touched thee and as we have done unto thee nothing but good and have sent thee away in peace thou art now the blessed of the lord
and he made them a feast and they did eat and drink
and they rose up betimes in the morning and sware one to another and isaac sent them away and they departed from him in peace
and it came to pass the same day that isaac's servants came and told him concerning the well which they had digged and said unto him we have found water
and he called it shebah therefore the name of the city is beersheba unto this day
and esau was forty years old when he took to wife judith the daughter of beeri the hittite and bashemath the daughter of elon the hittite
which were a grief of mind unto isaac and to rebekah
and it came to pass that when isaac was old and his eyes were dim so that he could not see he called esau his eldest son and said unto him my son and he said unto him behold here am i
and he said behold now i am old i know not the day of my death
now therefore take i pray thee thy weapons thy quiver and thy bow and go out to the field and take me some venison
and make me savoury meat such as i love and bring it to me that i may eat that my soul may bless thee before i die
and rebekah heard when isaac spake to esau his son and esau went to the field to hunt for venison and to bring it
and rebekah spake unto jacob her son saying behold i heard thy father speak unto esau thy brother saying
bring me venison and make me savoury meat that i may eat and bless thee before the lord before my death
now therefore my son obey my voice according to that which i command thee
go now to the flock and fetch me from thence two good kids of the goats and i will make them savoury meat for thy father such as he loveth
and thou shalt bring it to thy father that he may eat and that he may bless thee before his death
and jacob said to rebekah his mother behold esau my brother is a hairy man and i am a smooth man
my father peradventure will feel me and i shall seem to him as a deceiver and i shall bring a curse upon me and not a blessing
and his mother said unto him upon me be thy curse my son only obey my voice and go fetch me them
and he went and fetched and brought them to his mother and his mother made savoury meat such as his father loved
and rebekah took goodly raiment of her eldest son esau which were with her in the house and put them upon jacob her younger son
and she put the skins of the kids of the goats upon his hands and upon the smooth of his neck
and she gave the savoury meat and the bread which she had prepared into the hand of her son jacob
and he came unto his father and said my father and he said here am i who art thou my son
and jacob said unto his father i am esau thy first born i have done according as thou badest me arise i pray thee sit and eat of my venison that thy soul may bless me
and isaac said unto his son how is it that thou hast found it so quickly my son and he said because the lord thy god brought it to me
and isaac said unto jacob come near i pray thee that i may feel thee my son whether thou be my very son esau or not
and jacob went near unto isaac his father and he felt him and said the voice is jacob's voice but the hands are the hands of esau
and he discerned him not because his hands were hairy as his brother esau's hands so he blessed him
and he said art thou my very son esau and he said i am
and he said bring it near to me and i will eat of my son's venison that my soul may bless thee and he brought it near to him and he did eat and he brought him wine and he drank
and his father isaac said unto him come near now and kiss me my son
and he came near and kissed him and he smelled the smell of his raiment and blessed him and said see the smell of my son is as the smell of a field which the lord hath blessed
therefore god give thee of the dew of heaven and the fatness of the earth and plenty of corn and wine
let people serve thee and nations bow down to thee be lord over thy brethren and let thy mother's sons bow down to thee cursed be every one that curseth thee and blessed be he that blesseth thee
and it came to pass as soon as isaac had made an end of blessing jacob and jacob was yet scarce gone out from the presence of isaac his father that esau his brother came in from his hunting
and he also had made savoury meat and brought it unto his father and said unto his father let my father arise and eat of his son's venison that thy soul may bless me
and isaac his father said unto him who art thou and he said i am thy son thy firstborn esau
and isaac trembled very exceedingly and said who where is he that hath taken venison and brought it me and i have eaten of all before thou camest and have blessed him yea and he shall be blessed
and when esau heard the words of his father he cried with a great and exceeding bitter cry and said unto his father bless me even me also o my father
and he said thy brother came with subtilty and hath taken away thy blessing
and he said is not he rightly named jacob for he hath supplanted me these two times he took away my birthright and behold now he hath taken away my blessing and he said hast thou not reserved a blessing for me
and isaac answered and said unto esau behold i have made him thy lord and all his brethren have i given to him for servants and with corn and wine have i sustained him and what shall i do now unto thee my son
and esau said unto his father hast thou but one blessing my father bless me even me also o my father and esau lifted up his voice and wept
and isaac his father answered and said unto him behold thy dwelling shall be the fatness of the earth and of the dew of heaven from above
and by thy sword shalt thou live and shalt serve thy brother and it shall come to pass when thou shalt have the dominion that thou shalt break his yoke from off thy neck
and esau hated jacob because of the blessing wherewith his father blessed him and esau said in his heart the days of mourning for my father are at hand then will i slay my brother jacob
and these words of esau her elder son were told to rebekah and she sent and called jacob her younger son and said unto him behold thy brother esau as touching thee doth comfort himself purposing to kill thee
now therefore my son obey my voice and arise flee thou to laban my brother to haran
and tarry with him a few days until thy brother's fury turn away
until thy brother's anger turn away from thee and he forget that which thou hast done to him then i will send and fetch thee from thence why should i be deprived also of you both in one day
and rebekah said to isaac i am weary of my life because of the daughters of heth if jacob take a wife of the daughters of heth such as these which are of the daughters of the land what good shall my life do me
and isaac called jacob and blessed him and charged him and said unto him thou shalt not take a wife of the daughters of canaan
arise go to padanaram to the house of bethuel thy mother's father and take thee a wife from thence of the daughters of laban thy mother's brother
and god almighty bless thee and make thee fruitful and multiply thee that thou mayest be a multitude of people
and give thee the blessing of abraham to thee and to thy seed with thee that thou mayest inherit the land wherein thou art a stranger which god gave unto abraham
and isaac sent away jacob and he went to padanaram unto laban son of bethuel the syrian the brother of rebekah jacob's and esau's mother
when esau saw that isaac had blessed jacob and sent him away to padanaram to take him a wife from thence and that as he blessed him he gave him a charge saying thou shalt not take a wife of the daughters of canaan
and that jacob obeyed his father and his mother and was gone to padanaram
and esau seeing that the daughters of canaan pleased not isaac his father
then went esau unto ishmael and took unto the wives which he had mahalath the daughter of ishmael abraham's son the sister of nebajoth to be his wife
and jacob went out from beersheba and went toward haran
and he lighted upon a certain place and tarried there all night because the sun was set and he took of the stones of that place and put them for his pillows and lay down in that place to sleep
and he dreamed and behold a ladder set up on the earth and the top of it reached to heaven and behold the angels of god ascending and descending on it
and behold the lord stood above it and said i am the lord god of abraham thy father and the god of isaac the land whereon thou liest to thee will i give it and to thy seed
and thy seed shall be as the dust of the earth and thou shalt spread abroad to the west and to the east and to the north and to the south and in thee and in thy seed shall all the families of the earth be blessed
and behold i am with thee and will keep thee in all places whither thou goest and will bring thee again into this land for i will not leave thee until i have done that which i have spoken to thee of
and jacob awaked out of his sleep and he said surely the lord is in this place and i knew it not
and he was afraid and said how dreadful is this place this is none other but the house of god and this is the gate of heaven
and jacob rose up early in the morning and took the stone that he had put for his pillows and set it up for a pillar and poured oil upon the top of it
and he called the name of that place bethel but the name of that city was called luz at the first
and jacob vowed a vow saying if god will be with me and will keep me in this way that i go and will give me bread to eat and raiment to put on
so that i come again to my father's house in peace then shall the lord be my god
and this stone which i have set for a pillar shall be god's house and of all that thou shalt give me i will surely give the tenth unto thee
then jacob went on his journey and came into the land of the people of the east
and he looked and behold a well in the field and lo there were three flocks of sheep lying by it for out of that well they watered the flocks and a great stone was upon the well's mouth
