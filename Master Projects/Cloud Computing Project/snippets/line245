cornwall wherefore to dover let him first answer that
gloucester i am tied to the stake and i must stand the course
regan wherefore to dover sir
gloucester because i would not see thy cruel nails
 pluck out his poor old eyes nor thy fierce sister
 in his anointed flesh stick boarish fangs
 the sea with such a storm as his bare head
 in hellblack night endured would have buoy'd up
 and quench'd the stelled fires
 yet poor old heart he holp the heavens to rain
 if wolves had at thy gate howl'd that stern time
 thou shouldst have said good porter turn the key'
 all cruels else subscribed but i shall see
 the winged vengeance overtake such children
cornwall see't shalt thou never fellows hold the chair
