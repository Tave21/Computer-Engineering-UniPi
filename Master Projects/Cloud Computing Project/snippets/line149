1tim610 for the love of money is the root of all evil which while some coveted after they have erred from the faith and pierced themselves through with many sorrows
1tim611 but thou o man of god flee these things and follow after righteousness godliness faith love patience meekness
1tim612 fight the good fight of faith lay hold on eternal life whereunto thou art also called and hast professed a good profession before many witnesses
1tim613 i give thee charge in the sight of god who quickeneth all things and before christ jesus who before pontius pilate witnessed a good confession
1tim614 that thou keep this commandment without spot unrebukeable until the appearing of our lord jesus christ
1tim615 which in his times he shall shew who is the blessed and only potentate the king of kings and lord of lords
1tim616 who only hath immortality dwelling in the light which no man can approach unto whom no man hath seen nor can see to whom be honour and power everlasting amen
1tim617 charge them that are rich in this world that they be not highminded nor trust in uncertain riches but in the living god who giveth us richly all things to enjoy
1tim618 that they do good that they be rich in good works ready to distribute willing to communicate
1tim619 laying up in store for themselves a good foundation against the time to come that they may lay hold on eternal life
1tim620 o timothy keep that which is committed to thy trust avoiding profane and vain babblings and oppositions of science falsely so called
1tim621 which some professing have erred concerning the faith grace be with thee amen
2tim11 paul an apostle of jesus christ by the will of god according to the promise of life which is in christ jesus
2tim12 to timothy my dearly beloved son grace mercy and peace from god the father and christ jesus our lord
2tim13 i thank god whom i serve from my forefathers with pure conscience that without ceasing i have remembrance of thee in my prayers night and day
2tim14 greatly desiring to see thee being mindful of thy tears that i may be filled with joy
2tim15 when i call to remembrance the unfeigned faith that is in thee which dwelt first in thy grandmother lois and thy mother eunice and i am persuaded that in thee also
2tim16 wherefore i put thee in remembrance that thou stir up the gift of god which is in thee by the putting on of my hands
2tim17 for god hath not given us the spirit of fear but of power and of love and of a sound mind
2tim18 be not thou therefore ashamed of the testimony of our lord nor of me his prisoner but be thou partaker of the afflictions of the gospel according to the power of god
2tim19 who hath saved us and called us with an holy calling not according to our works but according to his own purpose and grace which was given us in christ jesus before the world began
2tim110 but is now made manifest by the appearing of our saviour jesus christ who hath abolished death and hath brought life and immortality to light through the gospel
2tim111 whereunto i am appointed a preacher and an apostle and a teacher of the gentiles
2tim112 for the which cause i also suffer these things nevertheless i am not ashamed for i know whom i have believed and am persuaded that he is able to keep that which i have committed unto him against that day
2tim113 hold fast the form of sound words which thou hast heard of me in faith and love which is in christ jesus
2tim114 that good thing which was committed unto thee keep by the holy ghost which dwelleth in us
2tim115 this thou knowest that all they which are in asia be turned away from me of whom are phygellus and hermogenes
2tim116 the lord give mercy unto the house of onesiphorus for he oft refreshed me and was not ashamed of my chain
2tim117 but when he was in rome he sought me out very diligently and found me
2tim118 the lord grant unto him that he may find mercy of the lord in that day and in how many things he ministered unto me at ephesus thou knowest very well
2tim21 thou therefore my son be strong in the grace that is in christ jesus
2tim22 and the things that thou hast heard of me among many witnesses the same commit thou to faithful men who shall be able to teach others also
2tim23 thou therefore endure hardness as a good soldier of jesus christ
2tim24 no man that warreth entangleth himself with the affairs of this life that he may please him who hath chosen him to be a soldier
2tim25 and if a man also strive for masteries yet is he not crowned except he strive lawfully
2tim26 the husbandman that laboureth must be first partaker of the fruits
2tim27 consider what i say and the lord give thee understanding in all things
2tim28 remember that jesus christ of the seed of david was raised from the dead according to my gospel
2tim29 wherein i suffer trouble as an evil doer even unto bonds but the word of god is not bound
2tim210 therefore i endure all things for the elect's sakes that they may also obtain the salvation which is in christ jesus with eternal glory
2tim211 it is a faithful saying for if we be dead with him we shall also live with him
2tim212 if we suffer we shall also reign with him if we deny him he also will deny us
2tim213 if we believe not yet he abideth faithful he cannot deny himself
2tim214 of these things put them in remembrance charging them before the lord that they strive not about words to no profit but to the subverting of the hearers
2tim215 study to shew thyself approved unto god a workman that needeth not to be ashamed rightly dividing the word of truth
2tim216 but shun profane and vain babblings for they will increase unto more ungodliness
2tim217 and their word will eat as doth a canker of whom is hymenaeus and philetus
2tim218 who concerning the truth have erred saying that the resurrection is past already and overthrow the faith of some
2tim219 nevertheless the foundation of god standeth sure having this seal the lord knoweth them that are his and let every one that nameth the name of christ depart from iniquity
2tim220 but in a great house there are not only vessels of gold and of silver but also of wood and of earth and some to honour and some to dishonour
2tim221 if a man therefore purge himself from these he shall be a vessel unto honour sanctified and meet for the master's use and prepared unto every good work
2tim222 flee also youthful lusts but follow righteousness faith charity peace with them that call on the lord out of a pure heart
2tim223 but foolish and unlearned questions avoid knowing that they do gender strifes
2tim224 and the servant of the lord must not strive but be gentle unto all men apt to teach patient
2tim225 in meekness instructing those that oppose themselves if god peradventure will give them repentance to the acknowledging of the truth
2tim226 and that they may recover themselves out of the snare of the devil who are taken captive by him at his will
2tim31 this know also that in the last days perilous times shall come
2tim32 for men shall be lovers of their own selves covetous boasters proud blasphemers disobedient to parents unthankful unholy
2tim33 without natural affection trucebreakers false accusers incontinent fierce despisers of those that are good
2tim34 traitors heady highminded lovers of pleasures more than lovers of god
2tim35 having a form of godliness but denying the power thereof from such turn away
2tim36 for of this sort are they which creep into houses and lead captive silly women laden with sins led away with divers lusts
2tim37 ever learning and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth
2tim38 now as jannes and jambres withstood moses so do these also resist the truth men of corrupt minds reprobate concerning the faith
2tim39 but they shall proceed no further for their folly shall be manifest unto all men as theirs also was
2tim310 but thou hast fully known my doctrine manner of life purpose faith longsuffering charity patience
2tim311 persecutions afflictions which came unto me at antioch at iconium at lystra what persecutions i endured but out of them all the lord delivered me
2tim312 yea and all that will live godly in christ jesus shall suffer persecution
2tim313 but evil men and seducers shall wax worse and worse deceiving and being deceived
2tim314 but continue thou in the things which thou hast learned and hast been assured of knowing of whom thou hast learned them
2tim315 and that from a child thou hast known the holy scriptures which are able to make thee wise unto salvation through faith which is in christ jesus
2tim316 all scripture is given by inspiration of god and is profitable for doctrine for reproof for correction for instruction in righteousness
2tim317 that the man of god may be perfect throughly furnished unto all good works
2tim41 i charge thee therefore before god and the lord jesus christ who shall judge the quick and the dead at his appearing and his kingdom
2tim42 preach the word be instant in season out of season reprove rebuke exhort with all longsuffering and doctrine
2tim43 for the time will come when they will not endure sound doctrine but after their own lusts shall they heap to themselves teachers having itching ears
2tim44 and they shall turn away their ears from the truth and shall be turned unto fables
2tim45 but watch thou in all things endure afflictions do the work of an evangelist make full proof of thy ministry
2tim46 for i am now ready to be offered and the time of my departure is at hand
2tim47 i have fought a good fight i have finished my course i have kept the faith
2tim48 henceforth there is laid up for me a crown of righteousness which the lord the righteous judge shall give me at that day and not to me only but unto all them also that love his appearing
2tim49 do thy diligence to come shortly unto me
2tim410 for demas hath forsaken me having loved this present world and is departed unto thessalonica crescens to galatia titus unto dalmatia
2tim411 only luke is with me take mark and bring him with thee for he is profitable to me for the ministry
2tim412 and tychicus have i sent to ephesus
2tim413 the cloke that i left at troas with carpus when thou comest bring with thee and the books but especially the parchments
2tim414 alexander the coppersmith did me much evil the lord reward him according to his works
2tim415 of whom be thou ware also for he hath greatly withstood our words
2tim416 at my first answer no man stood with me but all men forsook me i pray god that it may not be laid to their charge
2tim417 notwithstanding the lord stood with me and strengthened me that by me the preaching might be fully known and that all the gentiles might hear and i was delivered out of the mouth of the lion
2tim418 and the lord shall deliver me from every evil work and will preserve me unto his heavenly kingdom to whom be glory for ever and ever amen
2tim419 salute prisca and aquila and the household of onesiphorus
2tim420 erastus abode at corinth but trophimus have i left at miletum sick
2tim421 do thy diligence to come before winter eubulus greeteth thee and pudens and linus and claudia and all the brethren
2tim422 the lord jesus christ be with thy spirit grace be with you amen
paul a servant of god and an apostle of jesus christ according to the faith of god's elect and the acknowledging of the truth which is after godliness
in hope of eternal life which god that cannot lie promised before the world began
but hath in due times manifested his word through preaching which is committed unto me according to the commandment of god our saviour
to titus mine own son after the common faith grace mercy and peace from god the father and the lord jesus christ our saviour
for this cause left i thee in crete that thou shouldest set in order the things that are wanting and ordain elders in every city as i had appointed thee
if any be blameless the husband of one wife having faithful children not accused of riot or unruly
for a bishop must be blameless as the steward of god not selfwilled not soon angry not given to wine no striker not given to filthy lucre
but a lover of hospitality a lover of good men sober just holy temperate
holding fast the faithful word as he hath been taught that he may be able by sound doctrine both to exhort and to convince the gainsayers
for there are many unruly and vain talkers and deceivers specially they of the circumcision
whose mouths must be stopped who subvert whole houses teaching things which they ought not for filthy lucre's sake
one of themselves even a prophet of their own said the cretians are alway liars evil beasts slow bellies
this witness is true wherefore rebuke them sharply that they may be sound in the faith
not giving heed to jewish fables and commandments of men that turn from the truth
unto the pure all things are pure but unto them that are defiled and unbelieving is nothing pure but even their mind and conscience is defiled
they profess that they know god but in works they deny him being abominable and disobedient and unto every good work reprobate
but speak thou the things which become sound doctrine
that the aged men be sober grave temperate sound in faith in charity in patience
the aged women likewise that they be in behaviour as becometh holiness not false accusers not given to much wine teachers of good things
that they may teach the young women to be sober to love their husbands to love their children
to be discreet chaste keepers at home good obedient to their own husbands that the word of god be not blasphemed
young men likewise exhort to be sober minded
in all things shewing thyself a pattern of good works in doctrine shewing uncorruptness gravity sincerity
sound speech that cannot be condemned that he that is of the contrary part may be ashamed having no evil thing to say of you
exhort servants to be obedient unto their own masters and to please them well in all things not answering again
not purloining but shewing all good fidelity that they may adorn the doctrine of god our saviour in all things
for the grace of god that bringeth salvation hath appeared to all men
teaching us that denying ungodliness and worldly lusts we should live soberly righteously and godly in this present world
looking for that blessed hope and the glorious appearing of the great god and our saviour jesus christ
who gave himself for us that he might redeem us from all iniquity and purify unto himself a peculiar people zealous of good works
these things speak and exhort and rebuke with all authority let no man despise thee
put them in mind to be subject to principalities and powers to obey magistrates to be ready to every good work
to speak evil of no man to be no brawlers but gentle shewing all meekness unto all men
for we ourselves also were sometimes foolish disobedient deceived serving divers lusts and pleasures living in malice and envy hateful and hating one another
but after that the kindness and love of god our saviour toward man appeared
not by works of righteousness which we have done but according to his mercy he saved us by the washing of regeneration and renewing of the holy ghost
which he shed on us abundantly through jesus christ our saviour
that being justified by his grace we should be made heirs according to the hope of eternal life
this is a faithful saying and these things i will that thou affirm constantly that they which have believed in god might be careful to maintain good works these things are good and profitable unto men
but avoid foolish questions and genealogies and contentions and strivings about the law for they are unprofitable and vain
a man that is an heretick after the first and second admonition reject
knowing that he that is such is subverted and sinneth being condemned of himself
when i shall send artemas unto thee or tychicus be diligent to come unto me to nicopolis for i have determined there to winter
bring zenas the lawyer and apollos on their journey diligently that nothing be wanting unto them
and let ours also learn to maintain good works for necessary uses that they be not unfruitful
all that are with me salute thee greet them that love us in the faith grace be with you all amen
paul a prisoner of jesus christ and timothy our brother unto philemon our dearly beloved and fellowlabourer
and to our beloved apphia and archippus our fellowsoldier and to the church in thy house
grace to you and peace from god our father and the lord jesus christ
i thank my god making mention of thee always in my prayers
hearing of thy love and faith which thou hast toward the lord jesus and toward all saints
that the communication of thy faith may become effectual by the acknowledging of every good thing which is in you in christ jesus
for we have great joy and consolation in thy love because the bowels of the saints are refreshed by thee brother
wherefore though i might be much bold in christ to enjoin thee that which is convenient
yet for love's sake i rather beseech thee being such an one as paul the aged and now also a prisoner of jesus christ
i beseech thee for my son onesimus whom i have begotten in my bonds
which in time past was to thee unprofitable but now profitable to thee and to me
whom i have sent again thou therefore receive him that is mine own bowels
whom i would have retained with me that in thy stead he might have ministered unto me in the bonds of the gospel
but without thy mind would i do nothing that thy benefit should not be as it were of necessity but willingly
for perhaps he therefore departed for a season that thou shouldest receive him for ever
not now as a servant but above a servant a brother beloved specially to me but how much more unto thee both in the flesh and in the lord
if thou count me therefore a partner receive him as myself
if he hath wronged thee or oweth thee ought put that on mine account
i paul have written it with mine own hand i will repay it albeit i do not say to thee how thou owest unto me even thine own self besides
yea brother let me have joy of thee in the lord refresh my bowels in the lord
having confidence in thy obedience i wrote unto thee knowing that thou wilt also do more than i say
but withal prepare me also a lodging for i trust that through your prayers i shall be given unto you
there salute thee epaphras my fellowprisoner in christ jesus
marcus aristarchus demas lucas my fellowlabourers
the grace of our lord jesus christ be with your spirit amen
god who at sundry times and in divers manners spake in time past unto the fathers by the prophets
hath in these last days spoken unto us by his son whom he hath appointed heir of all things by whom also he made the worlds
who being the brightness of his glory and the express image of his person and upholding all things by the word of his power when he had by himself purged our sins sat down on the right hand of the majesty on high
being made so much better than the angels as he hath by inheritance obtained a more excellent name than they
for unto which of the angels said he at any time thou art my son this day have i begotten thee and again i will be to him a father and he shall be to me a son
and again when he bringeth in the firstbegotten into the world he saith and let all the angels of god worship him
and of the angels he saith who maketh his angels spirits and his ministers a flame of fire
but unto the son he saith thy throne o god is for ever and ever a sceptre of righteousness is the sceptre of thy kingdom
thou hast loved righteousness and hated iniquity therefore god even thy god hath anointed thee with the oil of gladness above thy fellows
and thou lord in the beginning hast laid the foundation of the earth and the heavens are the works of thine hands
they shall perish but thou remainest and they all shall wax old as doth a garment
and as a vesture shalt thou fold them up and they shall be changed but thou art the same and thy years shall not fail
but to which of the angels said he at any time sit on my right hand until i make thine enemies thy footstool
are they not all ministering spirits sent forth to minister for them who shall be heirs of salvation
therefore we ought to give the more earnest heed to the things which we have heard lest at any time we should let them slip
for if the word spoken by angels was stedfast and every transgression and disobedience received a just recompence of reward
how shall we escape if we neglect so great salvation which at the first began to be spoken by the lord and was confirmed unto us by them that heard him
god also bearing them witness both with signs and wonders and with divers miracles and gifts of the holy ghost according to his own will
for unto the angels hath he not put in subjection the world to come whereof we speak
but one in a certain place testified saying what is man that thou art mindful of him or the son of man that thou visitest him
thou madest him a little lower than the angels thou crownedst him with glory and honour and didst set him over the works of thy hands
thou hast put all things in subjection under his feet for in that he put all in subjection under him he left nothing that is not put under him but now we see not yet all things put under him
but we see jesus who was made a little lower than the angels for the suffering of death crowned with glory and honour that he by the grace of god should taste death for every man
for it became him for whom are all things and by whom are all things in bringing many sons unto glory to make the captain of their salvation perfect through sufferings
for both he that sanctifieth and they who are sanctified are all of one for which cause he is not ashamed to call them brethren
saying i will declare thy name unto my brethren in the midst of the church will i sing praise unto thee
and again i will put my trust in him and again behold i and the children which god hath given me
forasmuch then as the children are partakers of flesh and blood he also himself likewise took part of the same that through death he might destroy him that had the power of death that is the devil
and deliver them who through fear of death were all their lifetime subject to bondage
for verily he took not on him the nature of angels but he took on him the seed of abraham
wherefore in all things it behoved him to be made like unto his brethren that he might be a merciful and faithful high priest in things pertaining to god to make reconciliation for the sins of the people
for in that he himself hath suffered being tempted he is able to succour them that are tempted
wherefore holy brethren partakers of the heavenly calling consider the apostle and high priest of our profession christ jesus
who was faithful to him that appointed him as also moses was faithful in all his house
