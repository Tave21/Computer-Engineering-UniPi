 make claim and title to the crown of france
 hugh capet also who usurped the crown
 of charles the duke of lorraine sole heir male
 of the true line and stock of charles the great
 to find his title with some shows of truth
 through in pure truth it was corrupt and naught
 convey'd himself as heir to the lady lingare
 daughter to charlemain who was the son
 to lewis the emperor and lewis the son
 of charles the great also king lewis the tenth
 who was sole heir to the usurper capet
 could not keep quiet in his conscience
 wearing the crown of france till satisfied
 that fair queen isabel his grandmother
 was lineal of the lady ermengare
 daughter to charles the foresaid duke of lorraine
 by the which marriage the line of charles the great
 was reunited to the crown of france
 so that as clear as is the summer's sun
 king pepin's title and hugh capet's claim
 king lewis his satisfaction all appear
 to hold in right and title of the female
 so do the kings of france unto this day
 howbeit they would hold up this salique law
 to bar your highness claiming from the female
 and rather choose to hide them in a net
 than amply to imbar their crooked titles
 usurp'd from you and your progenitors
king henry v may i with right and conscience make this claim
canterbury the sin upon my head dread sovereign
 for in the book of numbers is it writ
 when the man dies let the inheritance
 descend unto the daughter gracious lord
 stand for your own unwind your bloody flag
 look back into your mighty ancestors
 go my dread lord to your greatgrandsire's tomb
 from whom you claim invoke his warlike spirit
 and your greatuncle's edward the black prince
 who on the french ground play'd a tragedy
 making defeat on the full power of france
 whiles his most mighty father on a hill
 stood smiling to behold his lion's whelp
 forage in blood of french nobility
 o noble english that could entertain
 with half their forces the full pride of france
 and let another half stand laughing by
 all out of work and cold for action
ely awake remembrance of these valiant dead
 and with your puissant arm renew their feats
 you are their heir you sit upon their throne
 the blood and courage that renowned them
 runs in your veins and my thricepuissant liege
 is in the very maymorn of his youth
 ripe for exploits and mighty enterprises
exeter your brother kings and monarchs of the earth
 do all expect that you should rouse yourself
 as did the former lions of your blood
westmoreland they know your grace hath cause and means and might
 so hath your highness never king of england
 had nobles richer and more loyal subjects
 whose hearts have left their bodies here in england
 and lie pavilion'd in the fields of france
canterbury o let their bodies follow my dear liege
 with blood and sword and fire to win your right
 in aid whereof we of the spiritualty
 will raise your highness such a mighty sum
 as never did the clergy at one time
 bring in to any of your ancestors
king henry v we must not only arm to invade the french
 but lay down our proportions to defend
 against the scot who will make road upon us
 with all advantages
canterbury they of those marches gracious sovereign
 shall be a wall sufficient to defend
 our inland from the pilfering borderers
king henry v we do not mean the coursing snatchers only
 but fear the main intendment of the scot
 who hath been still a giddy neighbour to us
 for you shall read that my greatgrandfather
 never went with his forces into france
 but that the scot on his unfurnish'd kingdom
 came pouring like the tide into a breach
 with ample and brim fulness of his force
 galling the gleaned land with hot assays
 girding with grievous siege castles and towns
 that england being empty of defence
 hath shook and trembled at the ill neighbourhood
canterbury she hath been then more fear'd than harm'd my liege
 for hear her but exampled by herself
 when all her chivalry hath been in france
 and she a mourning widow of her nobles
 she hath herself not only well defended
 but taken and impounded as a stray
 the king of scots whom she did send to france
 to fill king edward's fame with prisoner kings
 and make her chronicle as rich with praise
 as is the ooze and bottom of the sea
 with sunken wreck and sunless treasuries
westmoreland but there's a saying very old and true
 if that you will france win
 then with scotland first begin'
 for once the eagle england being in prey
 to her unguarded nest the weasel scot
 comes sneaking and so sucks her princely eggs
 playing the mouse in absence of the cat
 to tear and havoc more than she can eat
exeter it follows then the cat must stay at home
 yet that is but a crush'd necessity
 since we have locks to safeguard necessaries
 and pretty traps to catch the petty thieves
 while that the armed hand doth fight abroad
 the advised head defends itself at home
 for government though high and low and lower
 put into parts doth keep in one consent
 congreeing in a full and natural close
 like music
canterbury therefore doth heaven divide
 the state of man in divers functions
 setting endeavour in continual motion
 to which is fixed as an aim or butt
 obedience for so work the honeybees
 creatures that by a rule in nature teach
 the act of order to a peopled kingdom
 they have a king and officers of sorts
 where some like magistrates correct at home
 others like merchants venture trade abroad
 others like soldiers armed in their stings
 make boot upon the summer's velvet buds
 which pillage they with merry march bring home
 to the tentroyal of their emperor
 who busied in his majesty surveys
 the singing masons building roofs of gold
 the civil citizens kneading up the honey
 the poor mechanic porters crowding in
 their heavy burdens at his narrow gate
 the sadeyed justice with his surly hum
 delivering o'er to executors pale
 the lazy yawning drone i this infer
 that many things having full reference
 to one consent may work contrariously
 as many arrows loosed several ways
 come to one mark as many ways meet in one town
 as many fresh streams meet in one salt sea
 as many lines close in the dial's centre
 so may a thousand actions once afoot
 end in one purpose and be all well borne
 without defeat therefore to france my liege
 divide your happy england into four
 whereof take you one quarter into france
 and you withal shall make all gallia shake
 if we with thrice such powers left at home
 cannot defend our own doors from the dog
 let us be worried and our nation lose
 the name of hardiness and policy
king henry v call in the messengers sent from the dauphin
 exeunt some attendants
 now are we well resolved and by god's help
 and yours the noble sinews of our power
 france being ours we'll bend it to our awe
 or break it all to pieces or there we'll sit
 ruling in large and ample empery
 o'er france and all her almost kingly dukedoms
 or lay these bones in an unworthy urn
 tombless with no remembrance over them
 either our history shall with full mouth
 speak freely of our acts or else our grave
 like turkish mute shall have a tongueless mouth
 not worshipp'd with a waxen epitaph
 enter ambassadors of france
 now are we well prepared to know the pleasure
 of our fair cousin dauphin for we hear
 your greeting is from him not from the king
first ambassador may't please your majesty to give us leave
 freely to render what we have in charge
 or shall we sparingly show you far off
 the dauphin's meaning and our embassy
king henry v we are no tyrant but a christian king
 unto whose grace our passion is as subject
 as are our wretches fetter'd in our prisons
 therefore with frank and with uncurbed plainness
 tell us the dauphin's mind
first ambassador thus then in few
 your highness lately sending into france
 did claim some certain dukedoms in the right
 of your great predecessor king edward the third
 in answer of which claim the prince our master
 says that you savour too much of your youth
 and bids you be advised there's nought in france
 that can be with a nimble galliard won
 you cannot revel into dukedoms there
 he therefore sends you meeter for your spirit
 this tun of treasure and in lieu of this
 desires you let the dukedoms that you claim
 hear no more of you this the dauphin speaks
king henry v what treasure uncle
exeter tennisballs my liege
king henry v we are glad the dauphin is so pleasant with us
 his present and your pains we thank you for
 when we have march'd our rackets to these balls
 we will in france by god's grace play a set
