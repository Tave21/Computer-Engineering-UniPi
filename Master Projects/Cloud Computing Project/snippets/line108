seven days shall they purge the altar and purify it and they shall consecrate themselves
and when these days are expired it shall be that upon the eighth day and so forward the priests shall make your burnt offerings upon the altar and your peace offerings and i will accept you saith the lord god
then he brought me back the way of the gate of the outward sanctuary which looketh toward the east and it was shut
then said the lord unto me this gate shall be shut it shall not be opened and no man shall enter in by it because the lord the god of israel hath entered in by it therefore it shall be shut
it is for the prince the prince he shall sit in it to eat bread before the lord he shall enter by the way of the porch of that gate and shall go out by the way of the same
then brought he me the way of the north gate before the house and i looked and behold the glory of the lord filled the house of the lord and i fell upon my face
and the lord said unto me son of man mark well and behold with thine eyes and hear with thine ears all that i say unto thee concerning all the ordinances of the house of the lord and all the laws thereof and mark well the entering in of the house with every going forth of the sanctuary
and thou shalt say to the rebellious even to the house of israel thus saith the lord god o ye house of israel let it suffice you of all your abominations
in that ye have brought into my sanctuary strangers uncircumcised in heart and uncircumcised in flesh to be in my sanctuary to pollute it even my house when ye offer my bread the fat and the blood and they have broken my covenant because of all your abominations
and ye have not kept the charge of mine holy things but ye have set keepers of my charge in my sanctuary for yourselves
thus saith the lord god no stranger uncircumcised in heart nor uncircumcised in flesh shall enter into my sanctuary of any stranger that is among the children of israel
and the levites that are gone away far from me when israel went astray which went astray away from me after their idols they shall even bear their iniquity
yet they shall be ministers in my sanctuary having charge at the gates of the house and ministering to the house they shall slay the burnt offering and the sacrifice for the people and they shall stand before them to minister unto them
because they ministered unto them before their idols and caused the house of israel to fall into iniquity therefore have i lifted up mine hand against them saith the lord god and they shall bear their iniquity
and they shall not come near unto me to do the office of a priest unto me nor to come near to any of my holy things in the most holy place but they shall bear their shame and their abominations which they have committed
but i will make them keepers of the charge of the house for all the service thereof and for all that shall be done therein
but the priests the levites the sons of zadok that kept the charge of my sanctuary when the children of israel went astray from me they shall come near to me to minister unto me and they shall stand before me to offer unto me the fat and the blood saith the lord god
they shall enter into my sanctuary and they shall come near to my table to minister unto me and they shall keep my charge
and it shall come to pass that when they enter in at the gates of the inner court they shall be clothed with linen garments and no wool shall come upon them whiles they minister in the gates of the inner court and within
they shall have linen bonnets upon their heads and shall have linen breeches upon their loins they shall not gird themselves with any thing that causeth sweat
and when they go forth into the utter court even into the utter court to the people they shall put off their garments wherein they ministered and lay them in the holy chambers and they shall put on other garments and they shall not sanctify the people with their garments
neither shall they shave their heads nor suffer their locks to grow long they shall only poll their heads
neither shall any priest drink wine when they enter into the inner court
neither shall they take for their wives a widow nor her that is put away but they shall take maidens of the seed of the house of israel or a widow that had a priest before
and they shall teach my people the difference between the holy and profane and cause them to discern between the unclean and the clean
and in controversy they shall stand in judgment and they shall judge it according to my judgments and they shall keep my laws and my statutes in all mine assemblies and they shall hallow my sabbaths
and they shall come at no dead person to defile themselves but for father or for mother or for son or for daughter for brother or for sister that hath had no husband they may defile themselves
and after he is cleansed they shall reckon unto him seven days
and in the day that he goeth into the sanctuary unto the inner court to minister in the sanctuary he shall offer his sin offering saith the lord god
and it shall be unto them for an inheritance i am their inheritance and ye shall give them no possession in israel i am their possession
they shall eat the meat offering and the sin offering and the trespass offering and every dedicated thing in israel shall be theirs
and the first of all the firstfruits of all things and every oblation of all of every sort of your oblations shall be the priest's ye shall also give unto the priest the first of your dough that he may cause the blessing to rest in thine house
the priests shall not eat of any thing that is dead of itself or torn whether it be fowl or beast
moreover when ye shall divide by lot the land for inheritance ye shall offer an oblation unto the lord an holy portion of the land the length shall be the length of five and twenty thousand reeds and the breadth shall be ten thousand this shall be holy in all the borders thereof round about
of this there shall be for the sanctuary five hundred in length with five hundred in breadth square round about and fifty cubits round about for the suburbs thereof
and of this measure shalt thou measure the length of five and twenty thousand and the breadth of ten thousand and in it shall be the sanctuary and the most holy place
the holy portion of the land shall be for the priests the ministers of the sanctuary which shall come near to minister unto the lord and it shall be a place for their houses and an holy place for the sanctuary
and the five and twenty thousand of length and the ten thousand of breadth shall also the levites the ministers of the house have for themselves for a possession for twenty chambers
and ye shall appoint the possession of the city five thousand broad and five and twenty thousand long over against the oblation of the holy portion it shall be for the whole house of israel
and a portion shall be for the prince on the one side and on the other side of the oblation of the holy portion and of the possession of the city before the oblation of the holy portion and before the possession of the city from the west side westward and from the east side eastward and the length shall be over against one of the portions from the west border unto the east border
in the land shall be his possession in israel and my princes shall no more oppress my people and the rest of the land shall they give to the house of israel according to their tribes
thus saith the lord god let it suffice you o princes of israel remove violence and spoil and execute judgment and justice take away your exactions from my people saith the lord god
ye shall have just balances and a just ephah and a just bath
the ephah and the bath shall be of one measure that the bath may contain the tenth part of an homer and the ephah the tenth part of an homer the measure thereof shall be after the homer
and the shekel shall be twenty gerahs twenty shekels five and twenty shekels fifteen shekels shall be your maneh
this is the oblation that ye shall offer the sixth part of an ephah of an homer of wheat and ye shall give the sixth part of an ephah of an homer of barley
concerning the ordinance of oil the bath of oil ye shall offer the tenth part of a bath out of the cor which is an homer of ten baths for ten baths are an homer
and one lamb out of the flock out of two hundred out of the fat pastures of israel for a meat offering and for a burnt offering and for peace offerings to make reconciliation for them saith the lord god
all the people of the land shall give this oblation for the prince in israel
and it shall be the prince's part to give burnt offerings and meat offerings and drink offerings in the feasts and in the new moons and in the sabbaths in all solemnities of the house of israel he shall prepare the sin offering and the meat offering and the burnt offering and the peace offerings to make reconciliation for the house of israel
thus saith the lord god in the first month in the first day of the month thou shalt take a young bullock without blemish and cleanse the sanctuary
and the priest shall take of the blood of the sin offering and put it upon the posts of the house and upon the four corners of the settle of the altar and upon the posts of the gate of the inner court
and so thou shalt do the seventh day of the month for every one that erreth and for him that is simple so shall ye reconcile the house
in the first month in the fourteenth day of the month ye shall have the passover a feast of seven days unleavened bread shall be eaten
and upon that day shall the prince prepare for himself and for all the people of the land a bullock for a sin offering
and seven days of the feast he shall prepare a burnt offering to the lord seven bullocks and seven rams without blemish daily the seven days and a kid of the goats daily for a sin offering
and he shall prepare a meat offering of an ephah for a bullock and an ephah for a ram and an hin of oil for an ephah
in the seventh month in the fifteenth day of the month shall he do the like in the feast of the seven days according to the sin offering according to the burnt offering and according to the meat offering and according to the oil
thus saith the lord god the gate of the inner court that looketh toward the east shall be shut the six working days but on the sabbath it shall be opened and in the day of the new moon it shall be opened
and the prince shall enter by the way of the porch of that gate without and shall stand by the post of the gate and the priests shall prepare his burnt offering and his peace offerings and he shall worship at the threshold of the gate then he shall go forth but the gate shall not be shut until the evening
likewise the people of the land shall worship at the door of this gate before the lord in the sabbaths and in the new moons
and the burnt offering that the prince shall offer unto the lord in the sabbath day shall be six lambs without blemish and a ram without blemish
and the meat offering shall be an ephah for a ram and the meat offering for the lambs as he shall be able to give and an hin of oil to an ephah
and in the day of the new moon it shall be a young bullock without blemish and six lambs and a ram they shall be without blemish
and he shall prepare a meat offering an ephah for a bullock and an ephah for a ram and for the lambs according as his hand shall attain unto and an hin of oil to an ephah
and when the prince shall enter he shall go in by the way of the porch of that gate and he shall go forth by the way thereof
but when the people of the land shall come before the lord in the solemn feasts he that entereth in by the way of the north gate to worship shall go out by the way of the south gate and he that entereth by the way of the south gate shall go forth by the way of the north gate he shall not return by the way of the gate whereby he came in but shall go forth over against it
and the prince in the midst of them when they go in shall go in and when they go forth shall go forth
and in the feasts and in the solemnities the meat offering shall be an ephah to a bullock and an ephah to a ram and to the lambs as he is able to give and an hin of oil to an ephah
now when the prince shall prepare a voluntary burnt offering or peace offerings voluntarily unto the lord one shall then open him the gate that looketh toward the east and he shall prepare his burnt offering and his peace offerings as he did on the sabbath day then he shall go forth and after his going forth one shall shut the gate
thou shalt daily prepare a burnt offering unto the lord of a lamb of the first year without blemish thou shalt prepare it every morning
and thou shalt prepare a meat offering for it every morning the sixth part of an ephah and the third part of an hin of oil to temper with the fine flour a meat offering continually by a perpetual ordinance unto the lord
thus shall they prepare the lamb and the meat offering and the oil every morning for a continual burnt offering
thus saith the lord god if the prince give a gift unto any of his sons the inheritance thereof shall be his sons it shall be their possession by inheritance
but if he give a gift of his inheritance to one of his servants then it shall be his to the year of liberty after it shall return to the prince but his inheritance shall be his sons for them
moreover the prince shall not take of the people's inheritance by oppression to thrust them out of their possession but he shall give his sons inheritance out of his own possession that my people be not scattered every man from his possession
after he brought me through the entry which was at the side of the gate into the holy chambers of the priests which looked toward the north and behold there was a place on the two sides westward
then said he unto me this is the place where the priests shall boil the trespass offering and the sin offering where they shall bake the meat offering that they bear them not out into the utter court to sanctify the people
then he brought me forth into the utter court and caused me to pass by the four corners of the court and behold in every corner of the court there was a court
in the four corners of the court there were courts joined of forty cubits long and thirty broad these four corners were of one measure
and there was a row of building round about in them round about them four and it was made with boiling places under the rows round about
then said he unto me these are the places of them that boil where the ministers of the house shall boil the sacrifice of the people
afterward he brought me again unto the door of the house and behold waters issued out from under the threshold of the house eastward for the forefront of the house stood toward the east and the waters came down from under from the right side of the house at the south side of the altar
then brought he me out of the way of the gate northward and led me about the way without unto the utter gate by the way that looketh eastward and behold there ran out waters on the right side
and when the man that had the line in his hand went forth eastward he measured a thousand cubits and he brought me through the waters the waters were to the ankles
again he measured a thousand and brought me through the waters the waters were to the knees again he measured a thousand and brought me through the waters were to the loins
afterward he measured a thousand and it was a river that i could not pass over for the waters were risen waters to swim in a river that could not be passed over
and he said unto me son of man hast thou seen this then he brought me and caused me to return to the brink of the river
now when i had returned behold at the bank of the river were very many trees on the one side and on the other
then said he unto me these waters issue out toward the east country and go down into the desert and go into the sea which being brought forth into the sea the waters shall be healed
and it shall come to pass that every thing that liveth which moveth whithersoever the rivers shall come shall live and there shall be a very great multitude of fish because these waters shall come thither for they shall be healed and every thing shall live whither the river cometh
and it shall come to pass that the fishers shall stand upon it from engedi even unto eneglaim they shall be a place to spread forth nets their fish shall be according to their kinds as the fish of the great sea exceeding many
but the miry places thereof and the marishes thereof shall not be healed they shall be given to salt
and by the river upon the bank thereof on this side and on that side shall grow all trees for meat whose leaf shall not fade neither shall the fruit thereof be consumed it shall bring forth new fruit according to his months because their waters they issued out of the sanctuary and the fruit thereof shall be for meat and the leaf thereof for medicine
thus saith the lord god this shall be the border whereby ye shall inherit the land according to the twelve tribes of israel joseph shall have two portions
and ye shall inherit it one as well as another concerning the which i lifted up mine hand to give it unto your fathers and this land shall fall unto you for inheritance
and this shall be the border of the land toward the north side from the great sea the way of hethlon as men go to zedad

and it shall come to pass that ye shall divide it by lot for an inheritance unto you and to the strangers that sojourn among you which shall beget children among you and they shall be unto you as born in the country among the children of israel they shall have inheritance with you among the tribes of israel
and it shall come to pass that in what tribe the stranger sojourneth there shall ye give him his inheritance saith the lord god

in the third year of the reign of jehoiakim king of judah came nebuchadnezzar king of babylon unto jerusalem and besieged it
and the lord gave jehoiakim king of judah into his hand with part of the vessels of the house of god which he carried into the land of shinar to the house of his god and he brought the vessels into the treasure house of his god
and the king spake unto ashpenaz the master of his eunuchs that he should bring certain of the children of israel and of the king's seed and of the princes
children in whom was no blemish but well favoured and skilful in all wisdom and cunning in knowledge and understanding science and such as had ability in them to stand in the king's palace and whom they might teach the learning and the tongue of the chaldeans
and the king appointed them a daily provision of the king's meat and of the wine which he drank so nourishing them three years that at the end thereof they might stand before the king
now among these were of the children of judah daniel hananiah mishael and azariah
unto whom the prince of the eunuchs gave names for he gave unto daniel the name of belteshazzar and to hananiah of shadrach and to mishael of meshach and to azariah of abednego
but daniel purposed in his heart that he would not defile himself with the portion of the king's meat nor with the wine which he drank therefore he requested of the prince of the eunuchs that he might not defile himself
now god had brought daniel into favour and tender love with the prince of the eunuchs
and the prince of the eunuchs said unto daniel i fear my lord the king who hath appointed your meat and your drink for why should he see your faces worse liking than the children which are of your sort then shall ye make me endanger my head to the king
then said daniel to melzar whom the prince of the eunuchs had set over daniel hananiah mishael and azariah
prove thy servants i beseech thee ten days and let them give us pulse to eat and water to drink
then let our countenances be looked upon before thee and the countenance of the children that eat of the portion of the king's meat and as thou seest deal with thy servants
so he consented to them in this matter and proved them ten days
and at the end of ten days their countenances appeared fairer and fatter in flesh than all the children which did eat the portion of the king's meat
thus melzar took away the portion of their meat and the wine that they should drink and gave them pulse
as for these four children god gave them knowledge and skill in all learning and wisdom and daniel had understanding in all visions and dreams
now at the end of the days that the king had said he should bring them in then the prince of the eunuchs brought them in before nebuchadnezzar
and the king communed with them and among them all was found none like daniel hananiah mishael and azariah therefore stood they before the king
and in all matters of wisdom and understanding that the king enquired of them he found them ten times better than all the magicians and astrologers that were in all his realm
and daniel continued even unto the first year of king cyrus
and in the second year of the reign of nebuchadnezzar nebuchadnezzar dreamed dreams wherewith his spirit was troubled and his sleep brake from him
then the king commanded to call the magicians and the astrologers and the sorcerers and the chaldeans for to shew the king his dreams so they came and stood before the king
and the king said unto them i have dreamed a dream and my spirit was troubled to know the dream
then spake the chaldeans to the king in syriack o king live for ever tell thy servants the dream and we will shew the interpretation
the king answered and said to the chaldeans the thing is gone from me if ye will not make known unto me the dream with the interpretation thereof ye shall be cut in pieces and your houses shall be made a dunghill
but if ye shew the dream and the interpretation thereof ye shall receive of me gifts and rewards and great honour therefore shew me the dream and the interpretation thereof
they answered again and said let the king tell his servants the dream and we will shew the interpretation of it
the king answered and said i know of certainty that ye would gain the time because ye see the thing is gone from me
but if ye will not make known unto me the dream there is but one decree for you for ye have prepared lying and corrupt words to speak before me till the time be changed therefore tell me the dream and i shall know that ye can shew me the interpretation thereof
the chaldeans answered before the king and said there is not a man upon the earth that can shew the king's matter therefore there is no king lord nor ruler that asked such things at any magician or astrologer or chaldean
and it is a rare thing that the king requireth and there is none other that can shew it before the king except the gods whose dwelling is not with flesh
for this cause the king was angry and very furious and commanded to destroy all the wise men of babylon
and the decree went forth that the wise men should be slain and they sought daniel and his fellows to be slain
then daniel answered with counsel and wisdom to arioch the captain of the king's guard which was gone forth to slay the wise men of babylon
he answered and said to arioch the king's captain why is the decree so hasty from the king then arioch made the thing known to daniel
then daniel went in and desired of the king that he would give him time and that he would shew the king the interpretation
then daniel went to his house and made the thing known to hananiah mishael and azariah his companions
that they would desire mercies of the god of heaven concerning this secret that daniel and his fellows should not perish with the rest of the wise men of babylon
then was the secret revealed unto daniel in a night vision then daniel blessed the god of heaven
daniel answered and said blessed be the name of god for ever and ever for wisdom and might are his
and he changeth the times and the seasons he removeth kings and setteth up kings he giveth wisdom unto the wise and knowledge to them that know understanding
he revealeth the deep and secret things he knoweth what is in the darkness and the light dwelleth with him
i thank thee and praise thee o thou god of my fathers who hast given me wisdom and might and hast made known unto me now what we desired of thee for thou hast now made known unto us the king's matter
therefore daniel went in unto arioch whom the king had ordained to destroy the wise men of babylon he went and said thus unto him destroy not the wise men of babylon bring me in before the king and i will shew unto the king the interpretation
then arioch brought in daniel before the king in haste and said thus unto him i have found a man of the captives of judah that will make known unto the king the interpretation
the king answered and said to daniel whose name was belteshazzar art thou able to make known unto me the dream which i have seen and the interpretation thereof
daniel answered in the presence of the king and said the secret which the king hath demanded cannot the wise men the astrologers the magicians the soothsayers shew unto the king
but there is a god in heaven that revealeth secrets and maketh known to the king nebuchadnezzar what shall be in the latter days thy dream and the visions of thy head upon thy bed are these
as for thee o king thy thoughts came into thy mind upon thy bed what should come to pass hereafter and he that revealeth secrets maketh known to thee what shall come to pass
but as for me this secret is not revealed to me for any wisdom that i have more than any living but for their sakes that shall make known the interpretation to the king and that thou mightest know the thoughts of thy heart
thou o king sawest and behold a great image this great image whose brightness was excellent stood before thee and the form thereof was terrible
this image's head was of fine gold his breast and his arms of silver his belly and his thighs of brass
his legs of iron his feet part of iron and part of clay
thou sawest till that a stone was cut out without hands which smote the image upon his feet that were of iron and clay and brake them to pieces
then was the iron the clay the brass the silver and the gold broken to pieces together and became like the chaff of the summer threshingfloors and the wind carried them away that no place was found for them and the stone that smote the image became a great mountain and filled the whole earth
this is the dream and we will tell the interpretation thereof before the king
thou o king art a king of kings for the god of heaven hath given thee a kingdom power and strength and glory
and wheresoever the children of men dwell the beasts of the field and the fowls of the heaven hath he given into thine hand and hath made thee ruler over them all thou art this head of gold
and after thee shall arise another kingdom inferior to thee and another third kingdom of brass which shall bear rule over all the earth
