 when i have chased all thy foes from hence
 then will i think upon a recompense
charles meantime look gracious on thy prostrate thrall
reignier my lord methinks is very long in talk
alencon doubtless he shrives this woman to her smock
 else ne'er could he so long protract his speech
reignier shall we disturb him since he keeps no mean
alencon he may mean more than we poor men do know
 these women are shrewd tempters with their tongues
reignier my lord where are you what devise you on
 shall we give over orleans or no
joan la pucelle why no i say distrustful recreants
 fight till the last gasp i will be your guard
charles what she says i'll confirm we'll fight it out
joan la pucelle assign'd am i to be the english scourge
 this night the siege assuredly i'll raise
 expect saint martin's summer halcyon days
 since i have entered into these wars
 glory is like a circle in the water
 which never ceaseth to enlarge itself
 till by broad spreading it disperse to nought
 with henry's death the english circle ends
 dispersed are the glories it included
 now am i like that proud insulting ship
 which caesar and his fortune bare at once
charles was mahomet inspired with a dove
 thou with an eagle art inspired then
 helen the mother of great constantine
 nor yet saint philip's daughters were like thee
 bright star of venus fall'n down on the earth
 how may i reverently worship thee enough
alencon leave off delays and let us raise the siege
reignier woman do what thou canst to save our honours
 drive them from orleans and be immortalized
charles presently we'll try come let's away about it
 no prophet will i trust if she prove false

 woodvile the lieutenant speaks within
woodvile what noise is this what traitors have we here
gloucester lieutenant is it you whose voice i hear
 open the gates here's gloucester that would enter
woodvile have patience noble duke i may not open

of winchester gloucester thou wilt answer this before the pope
gloucester winchester goose i cry a rope a rope

 winchester's men and enter in the hurly
 burly the mayor of london and his officers
mayor fie lords that you being supreme magistrates
 thus contumeliously should break the peace
gloucester peace mayor thou know'st little of my wrongs
 here's beaufort that regards nor god nor king
 hath here distrain'd the tower to his use
bishop
of winchester here's gloucester a foe to citizens
 one that still motions war and never peace
 o'ercharging your free purses with large fines
 that seeks to overthrow religion
 because he is protector of the realm
 and would have armour here out of the tower
 to crown himself king and suppress the prince
gloucester i will not answer thee with words but blows
 here they skirmish again
mayor naught rests for me in this tumultuous strife
 but to make open proclamation
 come officer as loud as e'er thou canst
 cry
officer all manner of men assembled here in arms this day
 against god's peace and the king's we charge and
 command you in his highness name to repair to
 your several dwellingplaces and not to wear
 handle or use any sword weapon or dagger

act i
scene iv orleans
 enter on the walls a master gunner and his boy
mastergunner sirrah thou know'st how orleans is besieged
 and how the english have the suburbs won
boy father i know and oft have shot at them
 howe'er unfortunate i miss'd my aim
mastergunner but now thou shalt not be thou ruled by me
 chief mastergunner am i of this town
 something i must do to procure me grace
 the prince's espials have informed me
 how the english in the suburbs close intrench'd
 wont through a secret grate of iron bars
 in yonder tower to overpeer the city
 and thence discover how with most advantage
 they may vex us with shot or with assault
 to intercept this inconvenience
 a piece of ordnance gainst it i have placed
 and even these three days have i watch'd
 if i could see them
 now do thou watch for i can stay no longer
 if thou spy'st any run and bring me word
 and thou shalt find me at the governor's
 exit
boy father i warrant you take you no care
 i'll never trouble you if i may spy them
 exit
 enter on the turrets salisbury and talbot
 glansdale gargrave and others
salisbury talbot my life my joy again return'd
 how wert thou handled being prisoner
 or by what means got'st thou to be released
 discourse i prithee on this turret's top
talbot the duke of bedford had a prisoner
 call'd the brave lord ponton de santrailles
 for him was i exchanged and ransomed
 but with a baser man of arms by far
 once in contempt they would have barter'd me
 which i disdaining scorn'd and craved death
 rather than i would be so vile esteem'd
 in fine redeem'd i was as i desired
 but o the treacherous fastolfe wounds my heart
 whom with my bare fists i would execute
 if i now had him brought into my power
salisbury yet tell'st thou not how thou wert entertain'd
talbot with scoffs and scorns and contumelious taunts
 in open marketplace produced they me
 to be a public spectacle to all
