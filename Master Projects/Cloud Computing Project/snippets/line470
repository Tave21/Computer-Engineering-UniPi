 can construe the action of her familiar style and
 the hardest voice of her behavior to be englished

pistol he hath studied her will and translated her will
 out of honesty into english

pistol as many devils entertain and to her boy say i
nym the humour rises it is good humour me the angels

 another to page's wife who even now gave me good
 eyes too examined my parts with most judicious
 oeillades sometimes the beam of her view gilded my
 foot sometimes my portly belly
pistol then did the sun on dunghill shine
nym i thank thee for that humour
falstaff o she did so course o'er my exteriors with such a
 greedy intention that the appetite of her eye did
 seem to scorch me up like a burningglass here's
 another letter to her she bears the purse too she
 is a region in guiana all gold and bounty i will
 be cheater to them both and they shall be
 exchequers to me they shall be my east and west
 indies and i will trade to them both go bear thou

 exeunt falstaff and robin
pistol let vultures gripe thy guts for gourd and fullam holds
 and high and low beguiles the rich and poor
 tester i'll have in pouch when thou shalt lack
 base phrygian turk

nym by welkin and her star
pistol with wit or steel
nym with both the humours i
 i will discuss the humour of this love to page
pistol and i to ford shall eke unfold
 how falstaff varlet vile
 his dove will prove his gold will hold
 and his soft couch defile
