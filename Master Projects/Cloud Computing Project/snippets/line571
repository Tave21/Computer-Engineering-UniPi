 lady you are the cruell'st she alive
 if you will lead these graces to the grave
 and leave the world no copy
olivia o sir i will not be so hardhearted i will give
 out divers schedules of my beauty it shall be
 inventoried and every particle and utensil
 labelled to my will as item two lips
 indifferent red item two grey eyes with lids to
 them item one neck one chin and so forth were
 you sent hither to praise me
viola i see you what you are you are too proud
 but if you were the devil you are fair
 my lord and master loves you o such love
 could be but recompensed though you were crown'd
 the nonpareil of beauty
olivia how does he love me
viola with adorations fertile tears
 with groans that thunder love with sighs of fire
olivia your lord does know my mind i cannot love him
 yet i suppose him virtuous know him noble
 of great estate of fresh and stainless youth
 in voices well divulged free learn'd and valiant
 and in dimension and the shape of nature
 a gracious person but yet i cannot love him
 he might have took his answer long ago
viola if i did love you in my master's flame
 with such a suffering such a deadly life
 in your denial i would find no sense
 i would not understand it
olivia why what would you
viola make me a willow cabin at your gate
 and call upon my soul within the house
 write loyal cantons of contemned love
 and sing them loud even in the dead of night
 halloo your name to the reverberate hills
 and make the babbling gossip of the air
 cry out olivia o you should not rest
 between the elements of air and earth
 but you should pity me
olivia you might do much
 what is your parentage
viola above my fortunes yet my state is well
 i am a gentleman
olivia get you to your lord
 i cannot love him let him send no more
 unless perchance you come to me again
 to tell me how he takes it fare you well
 i thank you for your pains spend this for me
viola i am no fee'd post lady keep your purse
 my master not myself lacks recompense
 love make his heart of flint that you shall love
 and let your fervor like my master's be
 placed in contempt farewell fair cruelty
 exit
olivia what is your parentage'
 above my fortunes yet my state is well
 i am a gentleman i'll be sworn thou art
 thy tongue thy face thy limbs actions and spirit
 do give thee fivefold blazon not too fast
 soft soft
 unless the master were the man how now
 even so quickly may one catch the plague
 methinks i feel this youth's perfections
 with an invisible and subtle stealth
 to creep in at mine eyes well let it be
 what ho malvolio
 reenter malvolio
malvolio here madam at your service
olivia run after that same peevish messenger
 the county's man he left this ring behind him
 would i or not tell him i'll none of it
 desire him not to flatter with his lord
 nor hold him up with hopes i am not for him
 if that the youth will come this way tomorrow
 i'll give him reasons for't hie thee malvolio

 exit
olivia i do i know not what and fear to find
 mine eye too great a flatterer for my mind
 fate show thy force ourselves we do not owe
 what is decreed must be and be this so
 exit
 twelfth night
act ii
scene i the seacoast
 enter antonio and sebastian
antonio will you stay no longer nor will you not that i go with you
sebastian by your patience no my stars shine darkly over
 me the malignancy of my fate might perhaps
 distemper yours therefore i shall crave of you your
 leave that i may bear my evils alone it were a bad
 recompense for your love to lay any of them on you
antonio let me yet know of you whither you are bound
sebastian no sooth sir my determinate voyage is mere
 extravagancy but i perceive in you so excellent a
 touch of modesty that you will not extort from me
 what i am willing to keep in therefore it charges
 me in manners the rather to express myself you
 must know of me then antonio my name is sebastian
 which i called roderigo my father was that
 sebastian of messaline whom i know you have heard
 of he left behind him myself and a sister both
 born in an hour if the heavens had been pleased
 would we had so ended but you sir altered that
 for some hour before you took me from the breach of
 the sea was my sister drowned
antonio alas the day
sebastian a lady sir though it was said she much resembled
 me was yet of many accounted beautiful but
 though i could not with such estimable wonder
 overfar believe that yet thus far i will boldly
 publish her she bore a mind that envy could not but
 call fair she is drowned already sir with salt
 water though i seem to drown her remembrance again with more
antonio pardon me sir your bad entertainment
sebastian o good antonio forgive me your trouble
antonio if you will not murder me for my love let me be
 your servant
sebastian if you will not undo what you have done that is
 kill him whom you have recovered desire it not
 fare ye well at once my bosom is full of kindness
 and i am yet so near the manners of my mother that
 upon the least occasion more mine eyes will tell
 tales of me i am bound to the count orsino's court farewell
 exit
antonio the gentleness of all the gods go with thee
 i have many enemies in orsino's court
 else would i very shortly see thee there
 but come what may i do adore thee so
 that danger shall seem sport and i will go
 exit
 twelfth night
act ii
scene ii a street
 enter viola malvolio following
malvolio were not you even now with the countess olivia
viola even now sir on a moderate pace i have since
 arrived but hither
malvolio she returns this ring to you sir you might have
 saved me my pains to have taken it away yourself
 she adds moreover that you should put your lord
 into a desperate assurance she will none of him
 and one thing more that you be never so hardy to
 come again in his affairs unless it be to report
 your lord's taking of this receive it so
viola she took the ring of me i'll none of it
malvolio come sir you peevishly threw it to her and her
 will is it should be so returned if it be worth
 stooping for there it lies in your eye if not be
 it his that finds it
 exit
viola i left no ring with her what means this lady
 fortune forbid my outside have not charm'd her
 she made good view of me indeed so much
 that sure methought her eyes had lost her tongue
 for she did speak in starts distractedly
 she loves me sure the cunning of her passion
 invites me in this churlish messenger
 none of my lord's ring why he sent her none
 i am the man if it be so as tis
 poor lady she were better love a dream
 disguise i see thou art a wickedness
 wherein the pregnant enemy does much
 how easy is it for the properfalse
 in women's waxen hearts to set their forms
 alas our frailty is the cause not we
 for such as we are made of such we be
 how will this fadge my master loves her dearly
 and i poor monster fond as much on him
 and she mistaken seems to dote on me
 what will become of this as i am man
 my state is desperate for my master's love
 as i am womannow alas the day
 what thriftless sighs shall poor olivia breathe
 o time thou must untangle this not i
 it is too hard a knot for me to untie
 exit
 twelfth night
act ii
scene iii olivia's house
 enter sir toby belch and sir andrew
sir toby belch approach sir andrew not to be abed after
 midnight is to be up betimes and diluculo
 surgere thou know'st
sir andrew nay my troth i know not but i know to be up
 late is to be up late
sir toby belch a false conclusion i hate it as an unfilled can
 to be up after midnight and to go to bed then is
 early so that to go to bed after midnight is to go
 to bed betimes does not our life consist of the
 four elements
sir andrew faith so they say but i think it rather consists
 of eating and drinking
sir toby belch thou'rt a scholar let us therefore eat and drink
 marian i say a stoup of wine
 enter clown
sir andrew here comes the fool i faith
clown how now my hearts did you never see the picture
 of we three'
