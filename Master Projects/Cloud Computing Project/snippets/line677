 heard steel if thou turn the edge or cut not out
 the burlyboned clown in chines of beef ere thou
 sleep in thy sheath i beseech god on my knees thou
 mayst be turned to hobnails
 here they fight cade falls
 o i am slain famine and no other hath slain me
 let ten thousand devils come against me and give me
 but the ten meals i have lost and i'll defy them
 all wither garden and be henceforth a
 buryingplace to all that do dwell in this house
 because the unconquered soul of cade is fled
iden is't cade that i have slain that monstrous traitor
 sword i will hollow thee for this thy deed
 and hang thee o'er my tomb when i am dead
 ne'er shall this blood be wiped from thy point
 but thou shalt wear it as a herald's coat
 to emblaze the honour that thy master got
cade iden farewell and be proud of thy victory tell
 kent from me she hath lost her best man and exhort
 all the world to be cowards for i that never
 feared any am vanquished by famine not by valour
 dies
iden how much thou wrong'st me heaven be my judge
 die damned wretch the curse of her that bare thee
 and as i thrust thy body in with my sword
 so wish i i might thrust thy soul to hell
 hence will i drag thee headlong by the heels
 unto a dunghill which shall be thy grave
 and there cut off thy most ungracious head
 which i will bear in triumph to the king
 leaving thy trunk for crows to feed upon

 2 king henry vi
act v
scene i fields between dartford and blackheath
 enter york and his army of irish with drum
 and colours
york from ireland thus comes york to claim his right
 and pluck the crown from feeble henry's head
 ring bells aloud burn bonfires clear and bright
 to entertain great england's lawful king
 ah sancta majestas who would not buy thee dear
 let them obey that know not how to rule
 this hand was made to handle naught but gold
 i cannot give due action to my words
 except a sword or sceptre balance it
 a sceptre shall it have have i a soul
 on which i'll toss the flowerdeluce of france
 enter buckingham
 whom have we here buckingham to disturb me
 the king hath sent him sure i must dissemble
buckingham york if thou meanest well i greet thee well
york humphrey of buckingham i accept thy greeting
 art thou a messenger or come of pleasure
buckingham a messenger from henry our dread liege
 to know the reason of these arms in peace
 or why thou being a subject as i am
 against thy oath and true allegiance sworn
 should raise so great a power without his leave
 or dare to bring thy force so near the court
york aside scarce can i speak my choler is so great
 o i could hew up rocks and fight with flint
 i am so angry at these abject terms
 and now like ajax telamonius
 on sheep or oxen could i spend my fury
 i am far better born than is the king
 more like a king more kingly in my thoughts
 but i must make fair weather yet a while
 till henry be more weak and i more strong
 buckingham i prithee pardon me
 that i have given no answer all this while
 my mind was troubled with deep melancholy
 the cause why i have brought this army hither
 is to remove proud somerset from the king
 seditious to his grace and to the state
buckingham that is too much presumption on thy part
 but if thy arms be to no other end
 the king hath yielded unto thy demand
 the duke of somerset is in the tower
york upon thine honour is he prisoner
buckingham upon mine honour he is prisoner
york then buckingham i do dismiss my powers
 soldiers i thank you all disperse yourselves
 meet me tomorrow in st george's field
 you shall have pay and every thing you wish
 and let my sovereign virtuous henry
 command my eldest son nay all my sons
 as pledges of my fealty and love
 i'll send them all as willing as i live
 lands goods horse armour any thing i have
 is his to use so somerset may die
buckingham york i commend this kind submission
 we twain will go into his highness tent
 enter king henry vi and attendants
king henry vi buckingham doth york intend no harm to us
 that thus he marcheth with thee arm in arm
york in all submission and humility

york to heave the traitor somerset from hence
 and fight against that monstrous rebel cade
 who since i heard to be discomfited
 enter iden with cade's head
iden if one so rude and of so mean condition
 may pass into the presence of a king
 lo i present your grace a traitor's head

king henry vi see buckingham somerset comes with the queen
 go bid her hide him quickly from the duke
queen margaret for thousand yorks he shall not hide his head
 but boldly stand and front him to his face
york how now is somerset at liberty
 then york unloose thy longimprison'd thoughts
 and let thy tongue be equal with thy heart
 shall i endure the sight of somerset
 false king why hast thou broken faith with me
 knowing how hardly i can brook abuse
 king did i call thee no thou art not king
 not fit to govern and rule multitudes
 which darest not no nor canst not rule a traitor
 that head of thine doth not become a crown
 thy hand is made to grasp a palmer's staff
 and not to grace an awful princely sceptre
 that gold must round engirt these brows of mine
 whose smile and frown like to achilles spear
 is able with the change to kill and cure
 here is a hand to hold a sceptre up
 and with the same to act controlling laws
 give place by heaven thou shalt rule no more
 o'er him whom heaven created for thy ruler
somerset o monstrous traitor i arrest thee york
 of capital treason gainst the king and crown
 obey audacious traitor kneel for grace
york wouldst have me kneel first let me ask of these

 for thy mistaking so we pardon thee
clifford this is my king york i do not mistake
 but thou mistakest me much to think i do

king henry vi ay clifford a bedlam and ambitious humour
 makes him oppose himself against his king
clifford he is a traitor let him to the tower
 and chop away that factious pate of his
queen margaret he is arrested but will not obey
 his sons he says shall give their words for him
york will you not sons
edward ay noble father if our words will serve
richard and if words will not then our weapons shall
clifford why what a brood of traitors have we here
york look in a glass and call thy image so
 i am thy king and thou a falseheart traitor
 call hither to the stake my two brave bears
 that with the very shaking of their chains
 they may astonish these felllurking curs
 bid salisbury and warwick come to me
 enter the warwick and salisbury
clifford are these thy bears we'll bait thy bears to death
 and manacle the bearward in their chains
