 2 king henry iv
act iii
scene i westminster the palace
 enter king henry iv in his nightgown with a page
king henry iv go call the earls of surrey and of warwick
 but ere they come bid them o'erread these letters
 and well consider of them make good speed
 exit page
 how many thousand of my poorest subjects
 are at this hour asleep o sleep o gentle sleep
 nature's soft nurse how have i frighted thee
 that thou no more wilt weigh my eyelids down
 and steep my senses in forgetfulness
 why rather sleep liest thou in smoky cribs
 upon uneasy pallets stretching thee
 and hush'd with buzzing nightflies to thy slumber
 than in the perfumed chambers of the great
 under the canopies of costly state
 and lull'd with sound of sweetest melody
 o thou dull god why liest thou with the vile
 in loathsome beds and leavest the kingly couch
 a watchcase or a common larumbell
 wilt thou upon the high and giddy mast
 seal up the shipboy's eyes and rock his brains
 in cradle of the rude imperious surge
 and in the visitation of the winds
 who take the ruffian billows by the top
 curling their monstrous heads and hanging them
 with deafening clamour in the slippery clouds
 that with the hurly death itself awakes
 canst thou o partial sleep give thy repose
 to the wet seaboy in an hour so rude
 and in the calmest and most stillest night
 with all appliances and means to boot
 deny it to a king then happy low lie down
 uneasy lies the head that wears a crown
 enter warwick and surrey
warwick many good morrows to your majesty
king henry iv is it good morrow lords
warwick tis one o'clock and past
king henry iv why then good morrow to you all my lords
 have you read o'er the letters that i sent you
warwick we have my liege
king henry iv then you perceive the body of our kingdom
 how foul it is what rank diseases grow
 and with what danger near the heart of it
warwick it is but as a body yet distemper'd
 which to his former strength may be restored
 with good advice and little medicine
 my lord northumberland will soon be cool'd
king henry iv o god that one might read the book of fate
 and see the revolution of the times
 make mountains level and the continent
 weary of solid firmness melt itself
 into the sea and other times to see
 the beachy girdle of the ocean
 too wide for neptune's hips how chances mock
 and changes fill the cup of alteration
 with divers liquors o if this were seen
 the happiest youth viewing his progress through
 what perils past what crosses to ensue
 would shut the book and sit him down and die
 tis not ten years gone
 since richard and northumberland great friends
 did feast together and in two years after
 were they at wars it is but eight years since
 this percy was the man nearest my soul
 who like a brother toil'd in my affairs
 and laid his love and life under my foot
 yea for my sake even to the eyes of richard
 gave him defiance but which of you was by
