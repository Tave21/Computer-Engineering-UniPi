 the comedy of errors
act v
scene i a street before a priory
 enter second merchant and angelo
angelo i am sorry sir that i have hinder'd you
 but i protest he had the chain of me
 though most dishonestly he doth deny it
second merchant how is the man esteemed here in the city
angelo of very reverend reputation sir
 of credit infinite highly beloved
 second to none that lives here in the city
 his word might bear my wealth at any time
second merchant speak softly yonder as i think he walks
 enter antipholus of syracuse and dromio of syracuse
angelo tis so and that self chain about his neck
 which he forswore most monstrously to have
 good sir draw near to me i'll speak to him
 signior antipholus i wonder much
 that you would put me to this shame and trouble
 and not without some scandal to yourself
 with circumstance and oaths so to deny
 this chain which now you wear so openly
 beside the charge the shame imprisonment
 you have done wrong to this my honest friend
 who but for staying on our controversy
 had hoisted sail and put to sea today
 this chain you had of me can you deny it
antipholus
of syracuse i think i had i never did deny it
second merchant yes that you did sir and forswore it too
antipholus
of syracuse who heard me to deny it or forswear it
second merchant these ears of mine thou know'st did hear thee
 fie on thee wretch tis pity that thou livest
 to walk where any honest man resort
antipholus
of syracuse thou art a villain to impeach me thus
 i'll prove mine honour and mine honesty
 against thee presently if thou darest stand
second merchant i dare and do defy thee for a villain
 they draw
 enter adriana luciana the courtezan and others
adriana hold hurt him not for god's sake he is mad
 some get within him take his sword away
 bind dromio too and bear them to my house
dromio of syracuse run master run for god's sake take a house
 this is some priory in or we are spoil'd
 exeunt antipholus of syracuse and dromio of syracuse
 to the priory
 enter the lady abbess aemilia
aemelia be quiet people wherefore throng you hither
adriana to fetch my poor distracted husband hence
 let us come in that we may bind him fast
 and bear him home for his recovery
angelo i knew he was not in his perfect wits
second merchant i am sorry now that i did draw on him
aemelia how long hath this possession held the man
adriana this week he hath been heavy sour sad
 and much different from the man he was
 but till this afternoon his passion
 ne'er brake into extremity of rage
aemelia hath he not lost much wealth by wreck of sea
 buried some dear friend hath not else his eye
 stray'd his affection in unlawful love
 a sin prevailing much in youthful men
 who give their eyes the liberty of gazing
 which of these sorrows is he subject to
adriana to none of these except it be the last
 namely some love that drew him oft from home
aemelia you should for that have reprehended him
adriana why so i did
aemelia ay but not rough enough
adriana as roughly as my modesty would let me
aemelia haply in private
adriana and in assemblies too
aemelia ay but not enough
adriana it was the copy of our conference
 in bed he slept not for my urging it
 at board he fed not for my urging it
 alone it was the subject of my theme
 in company i often glanced it
 still did i tell him it was vile and bad
aemelia and thereof came it that the man was mad
 the venom clamours of a jealous woman
 poisons more deadly than a mad dog's tooth
 it seems his sleeps were hinder'd by thy railing
 and therefore comes it that his head is light
 thou say'st his meat was sauced with thy upbraidings
 unquiet meals make ill digestions
 thereof the raging fire of fever bred
 and what's a fever but a fit of madness
 thou say'st his sports were hinderd by thy brawls
 sweet recreation barr'd what doth ensue
 but moody and dull melancholy
 kinsman to grim and comfortless despair
 and at her heels a huge infectious troop
 of pale distemperatures and foes to life
 in food in sport and lifepreserving rest
 to be disturb'd would mad or man or beast
 the consequence is then thy jealous fits
 have scared thy husband from the use of wits
luciana she never reprehended him but mildly
 when he demean'd himself rough rude and wildly
 why bear you these rebukes and answer not
adriana she did betray me to my own reproof
 good people enter and lay hold on him
aemelia no not a creature enters in my house
adriana then let your servants bring my husband forth
aemelia neither he took this place for sanctuary
 and it shall privilege him from your hands
 till i have brought him to his wits again
 or lose my labour in assaying it
adriana i will attend my husband be his nurse
 diet his sickness for it is my office
 and will have no attorney but myself
 and therefore let me have him home with me
aemelia be patient for i will not let him stir
 till i have used the approved means i have
 with wholesome syrups drugs and holy prayers
 to make of him a formal man again
 it is a branch and parcel of mine oath
 a charitable duty of my order
 therefore depart and leave him here with me
adriana i will not hence and leave my husband here
 and ill it doth beseem your holiness
 to separate the husband and the wife
aemelia be quiet and depart thou shalt not have him
 exit
luciana complain unto the duke of this indignity
adriana come go i will fall prostrate at his feet
 and never rise until my tears and prayers
 have won his grace to come in person hither
 and take perforce my husband from the abbess
second merchant by this i think the dial points at five
 anon i'm sure the duke himself in person
 comes this way to the melancholy vale
 the place of death and sorry execution
 behind the ditches of the abbey here
angelo upon what cause
second merchant to see a reverend syracusian merchant
 who put unluckily into this bay
 against the laws and statutes of this town
 beheaded publicly for his offence
angelo see where they come we will behold his death
luciana kneel to the duke before he pass the abbey
 enter duke solinus attended aegeon bareheaded with the
 headsman and other officers
duke solinus yet once again proclaim it publicly
 if any friend will pay the sum for him
 he shall not die so much we tender him
adriana justice most sacred duke against the abbess
