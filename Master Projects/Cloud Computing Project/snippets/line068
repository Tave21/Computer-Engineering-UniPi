then let my wife grind unto another and let others bow down upon her
for this is an heinous crime yea it is an iniquity to be punished by the judges
for it is a fire that consumeth to destruction and would root out all mine increase
if i did despise the cause of my manservant or of my maidservant when they contended with me
what then shall i do when god riseth up and when he visiteth what shall i answer him
did not he that made me in the womb make him and did not one fashion us in the womb
if i have withheld the poor from their desire or have caused the eyes of the widow to fail
or have eaten my morsel myself alone and the fatherless hath not eaten thereof
for from my youth he was brought up with me as with a father and i have guided her from my mother's womb
if i have seen any perish for want of clothing or any poor without covering
if his loins have not blessed me and if he were not warmed with the fleece of my sheep
if i have lifted up my hand against the fatherless when i saw my help in the gate
then let mine arm fall from my shoulder blade and mine arm be broken from the bone
for destruction from god was a terror to me and by reason of his highness i could not endure
if i have made gold my hope or have said to the fine gold thou art my confidence
if i rejoiced because my wealth was great and because mine hand had gotten much
if i beheld the sun when it shined or the moon walking in brightness
and my heart hath been secretly enticed or my mouth hath kissed my hand
this also were an iniquity to be punished by the judge for i should have denied the god that is above
if i rejoiced at the destruction of him that hated me or lifted up myself when evil found him
neither have i suffered my mouth to sin by wishing a curse to his soul
if the men of my tabernacle said not oh that we had of his flesh we cannot be satisfied
the stranger did not lodge in the street but i opened my doors to the traveller
if i covered my transgressions as adam by hiding mine iniquity in my bosom
did i fear a great multitude or did the contempt of families terrify me that i kept silence and went not out of the door
oh that one would hear me behold my desire is that the almighty would answer me and that mine adversary had written a book
surely i would take it upon my shoulder and bind it as a crown to me
i would declare unto him the number of my steps as a prince would i go near unto him
if my land cry against me or that the furrows likewise thereof complain
if i have eaten the fruits thereof without money or have caused the owners thereof to lose their life
let thistles grow instead of wheat and cockle instead of barley the words of job are ended
so these three men ceased to answer job because he was righteous in his own eyes
then was kindled the wrath of elihu the son of barachel the buzite of the kindred of ram against job was his wrath kindled because he justified himself rather than god
also against his three friends was his wrath kindled because they had found no answer and yet had condemned job
now elihu had waited till job had spoken because they were elder than he
when elihu saw that there was no answer in the mouth of these three men then his wrath was kindled
and elihu the son of barachel the buzite answered and said i am young and ye are very old wherefore i was afraid and durst not shew you mine opinion
i said days should speak and multitude of years should teach wisdom
but there is a spirit in man and the inspiration of the almighty giveth them understanding
great men are not always wise neither do the aged understand judgment
therefore i said hearken to me i also will shew mine opinion
behold i waited for your words i gave ear to your reasons whilst ye searched out what to say
yea i attended unto you and behold there was none of you that convinced job or that answered his words
lest ye should say we have found out wisdom god thrusteth him down not man
now he hath not directed his words against me neither will i answer him with your speeches
they were amazed they answered no more they left off speaking
when i had waited for they spake not but stood still and answered no more
i said i will answer also my part i also will shew mine opinion
for i am full of matter the spirit within me constraineth me
behold my belly is as wine which hath no vent it is ready to burst like new bottles
i will speak that i may be refreshed i will open my lips and answer
let me not i pray you accept any man's person neither let me give flattering titles unto man
for i know not to give flattering titles in so doing my maker would soon take me away
wherefore job i pray thee hear my speeches and hearken to all my words
behold now i have opened my mouth my tongue hath spoken in my mouth
my words shall be of the uprightness of my heart and my lips shall utter knowledge clearly
the spirit of god hath made me and the breath of the almighty hath given me life
if thou canst answer me set thy words in order before me stand up
behold i am according to thy wish in god's stead i also am formed out of the clay
behold my terror shall not make thee afraid neither shall my hand be heavy upon thee
surely thou hast spoken in mine hearing and i have heard the voice of thy words saying
i am clean without transgression i am innocent neither is there iniquity in me
behold he findeth occasions against me he counteth me for his enemy
he putteth my feet in the stocks he marketh all my paths
behold in this thou art not just i will answer thee that god is greater than man
why dost thou strive against him for he giveth not account of any of his matters
for god speaketh once yea twice yet man perceiveth it not
in a dream in a vision of the night when deep sleep falleth upon men in slumberings upon the bed
then he openeth the ears of men and sealeth their instruction
that he may withdraw man from his purpose and hide pride from man
he keepeth back his soul from the pit and his life from perishing by the sword
he is chastened also with pain upon his bed and the multitude of his bones with strong pain
so that his life abhorreth bread and his soul dainty meat
his flesh is consumed away that it cannot be seen and his bones that were not seen stick out
yea his soul draweth near unto the grave and his life to the destroyers
if there be a messenger with him an interpreter one among a thousand to shew unto man his uprightness
then he is gracious unto him and saith deliver him from going down to the pit i have found a ransom
his flesh shall be fresher than a child's he shall return to the days of his youth
he shall pray unto god and he will be favourable unto him and he shall see his face with joy for he will render unto man his righteousness
he looketh upon men and if any say i have sinned and perverted that which was right and it profited me not
he will deliver his soul from going into the pit and his life shall see the light
lo all these things worketh god oftentimes with man
to bring back his soul from the pit to be enlightened with the light of the living
mark well o job hearken unto me hold thy peace and i will speak
if thou hast anything to say answer me speak for i desire to justify thee
if not hearken unto me hold thy peace and i shall teach thee wisdom
furthermore elihu answered and said
hear my words o ye wise men and give ear unto me ye that have knowledge
for the ear trieth words as the mouth tasteth meat
let us choose to us judgment let us know among ourselves what is good
for job hath said i am righteous and god hath taken away my judgment
should i lie against my right my wound is incurable without transgression
what man is like job who drinketh up scorning like water
which goeth in company with the workers of iniquity and walketh with wicked men
for he hath said it profiteth a man nothing that he should delight himself with god
therefore hearken unto me ye men of understanding far be it from god that he should do wickedness and from the almighty that he should commit iniquity
for the work of a man shall he render unto him and cause every man to find according to his ways
yea surely god will not do wickedly neither will the almighty pervert judgment
who hath given him a charge over the earth or who hath disposed the whole world
if he set his heart upon man if he gather unto himself his spirit and his breath
all flesh shall perish together and man shall turn again unto dust
if now thou hast understanding hear this hearken to the voice of my words
shall even he that hateth right govern and wilt thou condemn him that is most just
is it fit to say to a king thou art wicked and to princes ye are ungodly
how much less to him that accepteth not the persons of princes nor regardeth the rich more than the poor for they all are the work of his hands
in a moment shall they die and the people shall be troubled at midnight and pass away and the mighty shall be taken away without hand
for his eyes are upon the ways of man and he seeth all his goings
there is no darkness nor shadow of death where the workers of iniquity may hide themselves
for he will not lay upon man more than right that he should enter into judgment with god
he shall break in pieces mighty men without number and set others in their stead
therefore he knoweth their works and he overturneth them in the night so that they are destroyed
he striketh them as wicked men in the open sight of others
because they turned back from him and would not consider any of his ways
so that they cause the cry of the poor to come unto him and he heareth the cry of the afflicted
when he giveth quietness who then can make trouble and when he hideth his face who then can behold him whether it be done against a nation or against a man only
that the hypocrite reign not lest the people be ensnared
surely it is meet to be said unto god i have borne chastisement i will not offend any more
that which i see not teach thou me if i have done iniquity i will do no more
should it be according to thy mind he will recompense it whether thou refuse or whether thou choose and not i therefore speak what thou knowest
let men of understanding tell me and let a wise man hearken unto me
job hath spoken without knowledge and his words were without wisdom
my desire is that job may be tried unto the end because of his answers for wicked men
for he addeth rebellion unto his sin he clappeth his hands among us and multiplieth his words against god
elihu spake moreover and said
thinkest thou this to be right that thou saidst my righteousness is more than god's
for thou saidst what advantage will it be unto thee and what profit shall i have if i be cleansed from my sin
i will answer thee and thy companions with thee
look unto the heavens and see and behold the clouds which are higher than thou
if thou sinnest what doest thou against him or if thy transgressions be multiplied what doest thou unto him
if thou be righteous what givest thou him or what receiveth he of thine hand
thy wickedness may hurt a man as thou art and thy righteousness may profit the son of man
by reason of the multitude of oppressions they make the oppressed to cry they cry out by reason of the arm of the mighty
but none saith where is god my maker who giveth songs in the night
who teacheth us more than the beasts of the earth and maketh us wiser than the fowls of heaven
there they cry but none giveth answer because of the pride of evil men
surely god will not hear vanity neither will the almighty regard it
although thou sayest thou shalt not see him yet judgment is before him therefore trust thou in him
but now because it is not so he hath visited in his anger yet he knoweth it not in great extremity
therefore doth job open his mouth in vain he multiplieth words without knowledge
elihu also proceeded and said
suffer me a little and i will shew thee that i have yet to speak on god's behalf
i will fetch my knowledge from afar and will ascribe righteousness to my maker
for truly my words shall not be false he that is perfect in knowledge is with thee
behold god is mighty and despiseth not any he is mighty in strength and wisdom
he preserveth not the life of the wicked but giveth right to the poor
he withdraweth not his eyes from the righteous but with kings are they on the throne yea he doth establish them for ever and they are exalted
and if they be bound in fetters and be holden in cords of affliction
then he sheweth them their work and their transgressions that they have exceeded
he openeth also their ear to discipline and commandeth that they return from iniquity
if they obey and serve him they shall spend their days in prosperity and their years in pleasures
but if they obey not they shall perish by the sword and they shall die without knowledge
but the hypocrites in heart heap up wrath they cry not when he bindeth them
they die in youth and their life is among the unclean
he delivereth the poor in his affliction and openeth their ears in oppression
even so would he have removed thee out of the strait into a broad place where there is no straitness and that which should be set on thy table should be full of fatness
but thou hast fulfilled the judgment of the wicked judgment and justice take hold on thee
because there is wrath beware lest he take thee away with his stroke then a great ransom cannot deliver thee
will he esteem thy riches no not gold nor all the forces of strength
desire not the night when people are cut off in their place
take heed regard not iniquity for this hast thou chosen rather than affliction
behold god exalteth by his power who teacheth like him
who hath enjoined him his way or who can say thou hast wrought iniquity
remember that thou magnify his work which men behold
every man may see it man may behold it afar off
behold god is great and we know him not neither can the number of his years be searched out
for he maketh small the drops of water they pour down rain according to the vapour thereof
which the clouds do drop and distil upon man abundantly
also can any understand the spreadings of the clouds or the noise of his tabernacle
behold he spreadeth his light upon it and covereth the bottom of the sea
for by them judgeth he the people he giveth meat in abundance
with clouds he covereth the light and commandeth it not to shine by the cloud that cometh betwixt
the noise thereof sheweth concerning it the cattle also concerning the vapour
at this also my heart trembleth and is moved out of his place
hear attentively the noise of his voice and the sound that goeth out of his mouth
he directeth it under the whole heaven and his lightning unto the ends of the earth
after it a voice roareth he thundereth with the voice of his excellency and he will not stay them when his voice is heard
god thundereth marvellously with his voice great things doeth he which we cannot comprehend
for he saith to the snow be thou on the earth likewise to the small rain and to the great rain of his strength
he sealeth up the hand of every man that all men may know his work
then the beasts go into dens and remain in their places
out of the south cometh the whirlwind and cold out of the north
by the breath of god frost is given and the breadth of the waters is straitened
also by watering he wearieth the thick cloud he scattereth his bright cloud
and it is turned round about by his counsels that they may do whatsoever he commandeth them upon the face of the world in the earth
he causeth it to come whether for correction or for his land or for mercy
hearken unto this o job stand still and consider the wondrous works of god
dost thou know when god disposed them and caused the light of his cloud to shine
dost thou know the balancings of the clouds the wondrous works of him which is perfect in knowledge
how thy garments are warm when he quieteth the earth by the south wind
hast thou with him spread out the sky which is strong and as a molten looking glass
teach us what we shall say unto him for we cannot order our speech by reason of darkness
shall it be told him that i speak if a man speak surely he shall be swallowed up
and now men see not the bright light which is in the clouds but the wind passeth and cleanseth them
fair weather cometh out of the north with god is terrible majesty
touching the almighty we cannot find him out he is excellent in power and in judgment and in plenty of justice he will not afflict
men do therefore fear him he respecteth not any that are wise of heart
then the lord answered job out of the whirlwind and said
who is this that darkeneth counsel by words without knowledge
gird up now thy loins like a man for i will demand of thee and answer thou me
where wast thou when i laid the foundations of the earth declare if thou hast understanding
