surely he shall deliver thee from the snare of the fowler and from the noisome pestilence
he shall cover thee with his feathers and under his wings shalt thou trust his truth shall be thy shield and buckler
thou shalt not be afraid for the terror by night nor for the arrow that flieth by day
nor for the pestilence that walketh in darkness nor for the destruction that wasteth at noonday
a thousand shall fall at thy side and ten thousand at thy right hand but it shall not come nigh thee
only with thine eyes shalt thou behold and see the reward of the wicked
because thou hast made the lord which is my refuge even the most high thy habitation
there shall no evil befall thee neither shall any plague come nigh thy dwelling
for he shall give his angels charge over thee to keep thee in all thy ways
they shall bear thee up in their hands lest thou dash thy foot against a stone
thou shalt tread upon the lion and adder the young lion and the dragon shalt thou trample under feet
because he hath set his love upon me therefore will i deliver him i will set him on high because he hath known my name
he shall call upon me and i will answer him i will be with him in trouble i will deliver him and honour him
with long life will i satisfy him and shew him my salvation
it is a good thing to give thanks unto the lord and to sing praises unto thy name o most high
to shew forth thy lovingkindness in the morning and thy faithfulness every night
upon an instrument of ten strings and upon the psaltery upon the harp with a solemn sound
for thou lord hast made me glad through thy work i will triumph in the works of thy hands
o lord how great are thy works and thy thoughts are very deep
a brutish man knoweth not neither doth a fool understand this
when the wicked spring as the grass and when all the workers of iniquity do flourish it is that they shall be destroyed for ever
but thou lord art most high for evermore
for lo thine enemies o lord for lo thine enemies shall perish all the workers of iniquity shall be scattered
but my horn shalt thou exalt like the horn of an unicorn i shall be anointed with fresh oil
mine eye also shall see my desire on mine enemies and mine ears shall hear my desire of the wicked that rise up against me
the righteous shall flourish like the palm tree he shall grow like a cedar in lebanon
those that be planted in the house of the lord shall flourish in the courts of our god
they shall still bring forth fruit in old age they shall be fat and flourishing
to shew that the lord is upright he is my rock and there is no unrighteousness in him
the lord reigneth he is clothed with majesty the lord is clothed with strength wherewith he hath girded himself the world also is stablished that it cannot be moved
thy throne is established of old thou art from everlasting
the floods have lifted up o lord the floods have lifted up their voice the floods lift up their waves
the lord on high is mightier than the noise of many waters yea than the mighty waves of the sea
thy testimonies are very sure holiness becometh thine house o lord for ever
o lord god to whom vengeance belongeth o god to whom vengeance belongeth shew thyself
lift up thyself thou judge of the earth render a reward to the proud
lord how long shall the wicked how long shall the wicked triumph
how long shall they utter and speak hard things and all the workers of iniquity boast themselves
they break in pieces thy people o lord and afflict thine heritage
they slay the widow and the stranger and murder the fatherless
yet they say the lord shall not see neither shall the god of jacob regard it
understand ye brutish among the people and ye fools when will ye be wise
he that planted the ear shall he not hear he that formed the eye shall he not see
he that chastiseth the heathen shall not he correct he that teacheth man knowledge shall not he know
the lord knoweth the thoughts of man that they are vanity
blessed is the man whom thou chastenest o lord and teachest him out of thy law
that thou mayest give him rest from the days of adversity until the pit be digged for the wicked
for the lord will not cast off his people neither will he forsake his inheritance
but judgment shall return unto righteousness and all the upright in heart shall follow it
who will rise up for me against the evildoers or who will stand up for me against the workers of iniquity
unless the lord had been my help my soul had almost dwelt in silence
when i said my foot slippeth thy mercy o lord held me up
in the multitude of my thoughts within me thy comforts delight my soul
shall the throne of iniquity have fellowship with thee which frameth mischief by a law
they gather themselves together against the soul of the righteous and condemn the innocent blood
but the lord is my defence and my god is the rock of my refuge
and he shall bring upon them their own iniquity and shall cut them off in their own wickedness yea the lord our god shall cut them off
o come let us sing unto the lord let us make a joyful noise to the rock of our salvation
let us come before his presence with thanksgiving and make a joyful noise unto him with psalms
for the lord is a great god and a great king above all gods
in his hand are the deep places of the earth the strength of the hills is his also
the sea is his and he made it and his hands formed the dry land
o come let us worship and bow down let us kneel before the lord our maker
for he is our god and we are the people of his pasture and the sheep of his hand to day if ye will hear his voice
harden not your heart as in the provocation and as in the day of temptation in the wilderness
when your fathers tempted me proved me and saw my work
forty years long was i grieved with this generation and said it is a people that do err in their heart and they have not known my ways
unto whom i sware in my wrath that they should not enter into my rest
o sing unto the lord a new song sing unto the lord all the earth
sing unto the lord bless his name shew forth his salvation from day to day
declare his glory among the heathen his wonders among all people
for the lord is great and greatly to be praised he is to be feared above all gods
for all the gods of the nations are idols but the lord made the heavens
honour and majesty are before him strength and beauty are in his sanctuary
give unto the lord o ye kindreds of the people give unto the lord glory and strength
give unto the lord the glory due unto his name bring an offering and come into his courts
o worship the lord in the beauty of holiness fear before him all the earth
say among the heathen that the lord reigneth the world also shall be established that it shall not be moved he shall judge the people righteously
let the heavens rejoice and let the earth be glad let the sea roar and the fulness thereof
let the field be joyful and all that is therein then shall all the trees of the wood rejoice
before the lord for he cometh for he cometh to judge the earth he shall judge the world with righteousness and the people with his truth
the lord reigneth let the earth rejoice let the multitude of isles be glad thereof
clouds and darkness are round about him righteousness and judgment are the habitation of his throne
a fire goeth before him and burneth up his enemies round about
his lightnings enlightened the world the earth saw and trembled
the hills melted like wax at the presence of the lord at the presence of the lord of the whole earth
the heavens declare his righteousness and all the people see his glory
confounded be all they that serve graven images that boast themselves of idols worship him all ye gods
zion heard and was glad and the daughters of judah rejoiced because of thy judgments o lord
for thou lord art high above all the earth thou art exalted far above all gods
ye that love the lord hate evil he preserveth the souls of his saints he delivereth them out of the hand of the wicked
light is sown for the righteous and gladness for the upright in heart
rejoice in the lord ye righteous and give thanks at the remembrance of his holiness
o sing unto the lord a new song for he hath done marvellous things his right hand and his holy arm hath gotten him the victory
the lord hath made known his salvation his righteousness hath he openly shewed in the sight of the heathen
he hath remembered his mercy and his truth toward the house of israel all the ends of the earth have seen the salvation of our god
make a joyful noise unto the lord all the earth make a loud noise and rejoice and sing praise
sing unto the lord with the harp with the harp and the voice of a psalm
with trumpets and sound of cornet make a joyful noise before the lord the king
let the sea roar and the fulness thereof the world and they that dwell therein
let the floods clap their hands let the hills be joyful together
before the lord for he cometh to judge the earth with righteousness shall he judge the world and the people with equity
the lord reigneth let the people tremble he sitteth between the cherubims let the earth be moved
the lord is great in zion and he is high above all the people
let them praise thy great and terrible name for it is holy
the king's strength also loveth judgment thou dost establish equity thou executest judgment and righteousness in jacob
exalt ye the lord our god and worship at his footstool for he is holy
moses and aaron among his priests and samuel among them that call upon his name they called upon the lord and he answered them
he spake unto them in the cloudy pillar they kept his testimonies and the ordinance that he gave them
thou answeredst them o lord our god thou wast a god that forgavest them though thou tookest vengeance of their inventions
exalt the lord our god and worship at his holy hill for the lord our god is holy
make a joyful noise unto the lord all ye lands
serve the lord with gladness come before his presence with singing
know ye that the lord he is god it is he that hath made us and not we ourselves we are his people and the sheep of his pasture
enter into his gates with thanksgiving and into his courts with praise be thankful unto him and bless his name
for the lord is good his mercy is everlasting and his truth endureth to all generations
i will sing of mercy and judgment unto thee o lord will i sing
i will behave myself wisely in a perfect way o when wilt thou come unto me i will walk within my house with a perfect heart
i will set no wicked thing before mine eyes i hate the work of them that turn aside it shall not cleave to me
a froward heart shall depart from me i will not know a wicked person
whoso privily slandereth his neighbour him will i cut off him that hath an high look and a proud heart will not i suffer
mine eyes shall be upon the faithful of the land that they may dwell with me he that walketh in a perfect way he shall serve me
he that worketh deceit shall not dwell within my house he that telleth lies shall not tarry in my sight
i will early destroy all the wicked of the land that i may cut off all wicked doers from the city of the lord
hear my prayer o lord and let my cry come unto thee
hide not thy face from me in the day when i am in trouble incline thine ear unto me in the day when i call answer me speedily
for my days are consumed like smoke and my bones are burned as an hearth
my heart is smitten and withered like grass so that i forget to eat my bread
by reason of the voice of my groaning my bones cleave to my skin
i am like a pelican of the wilderness i am like an owl of the desert
i watch and am as a sparrow alone upon the house top
mine enemies reproach me all the day and they that are mad against me are sworn against me
for i have eaten ashes like bread and mingled my drink with weeping
because of thine indignation and thy wrath for thou hast lifted me up and cast me down
my days are like a shadow that declineth and i am withered like grass
but thou o lord shalt endure for ever and thy remembrance unto all generations
thou shalt arise and have mercy upon zion for the time to favour her yea the set time is come
for thy servants take pleasure in her stones and favour the dust thereof
so the heathen shall fear the name of the lord and all the kings of the earth thy glory
when the lord shall build up zion he shall appear in his glory
he will regard the prayer of the destitute and not despise their prayer
this shall be written for the generation to come and the people which shall be created shall praise the lord
for he hath looked down from the height of his sanctuary from heaven did the lord behold the earth
to hear the groaning of the prisoner to loose those that are appointed to death
to declare the name of the lord in zion and his praise in jerusalem
when the people are gathered together and the kingdoms to serve the lord
he weakened my strength in the way he shortened my days
i said o my god take me not away in the midst of my days thy years are throughout all generations
of old hast thou laid the foundation of the earth and the heavens are the work of thy hands
they shall perish but thou shalt endure yea all of them shall wax old like a garment as a vesture shalt thou change them and they shall be changed
but thou art the same and thy years shall have no end
the children of thy servants shall continue and their seed shall be established before thee
bless the lord o my soul and all that is within me bless his holy name
bless the lord o my soul and forget not all his benefits
who forgiveth all thine iniquities who healeth all thy diseases
who redeemeth thy life from destruction who crowneth thee with lovingkindness and tender mercies
who satisfieth thy mouth with good things so that thy youth is renewed like the eagle's
the lord executeth righteousness and judgment for all that are oppressed
he made known his ways unto moses his acts unto the children of israel
the lord is merciful and gracious slow to anger and plenteous in mercy
he will not always chide neither will he keep his anger for ever
he hath not dealt with us after our sins nor rewarded us according to our iniquities
for as the heaven is high above the earth so great is his mercy toward them that fear him
as far as the east is from the west so far hath he removed our transgressions from us
like as a father pitieth his children so the lord pitieth them that fear him
for he knoweth our frame he remembereth that we are dust
as for man his days are as grass as a flower of the field so he flourisheth
for the wind passeth over it and it is gone and the place thereof shall know it no more
but the mercy of the lord is from everlasting to everlasting upon them that fear him and his righteousness unto children's children
to such as keep his covenant and to those that remember his commandments to do them
the lord hath prepared his throne in the heavens and his kingdom ruleth over all
bless the lord ye his angels that excel in strength that do his commandments hearkening unto the voice of his word
bless ye the lord all ye his hosts ye ministers of his that do his pleasure
bless the lord all his works in all places of his dominion bless the lord o my soul
bless the lord o my soul o lord my god thou art very great thou art clothed with honour and majesty
who coverest thyself with light as with a garment who stretchest out the heavens like a curtain
who layeth the beams of his chambers in the waters who maketh the clouds his chariot who walketh upon the wings of the wind
who maketh his angels spirits his ministers a flaming fire
who laid the foundations of the earth that it should not be removed for ever
thou coveredst it with the deep as with a garment the waters stood above the mountains
at thy rebuke they fled at the voice of thy thunder they hasted away
they go up by the mountains they go down by the valleys unto the place which thou hast founded for them
thou hast set a bound that they may not pass over that they turn not again to cover the earth
he sendeth the springs into the valleys which run among the hills
they give drink to every beast of the field the wild asses quench their thirst
by them shall the fowls of the heaven have their habitation which sing among the branches
he watereth the hills from his chambers the earth is satisfied with the fruit of thy works
he causeth the grass to grow for the cattle and herb for the service of man that he may bring forth food out of the earth
and wine that maketh glad the heart of man and oil to make his face to shine and bread which strengtheneth man's heart
the trees of the lord are full of sap the cedars of lebanon which he hath planted
where the birds make their nests as for the stork the fir trees are her house
the high hills are a refuge for the wild goats and the rocks for the conies
he appointed the moon for seasons the sun knoweth his going down
thou makest darkness and it is night wherein all the beasts of the forest do creep forth
the young lions roar after their prey and seek their meat from god
the sun ariseth they gather themselves together and lay them down in their dens
man goeth forth unto his work and to his labour until the evening
o lord how manifold are thy works in wisdom hast thou made them all the earth is full of thy riches
so is this great and wide sea wherein are things creeping innumerable both small and great beasts
there go the ships there is that leviathan whom thou hast made to play therein
