benvolio at this same ancient feast of capulet's
 sups the fair rosaline whom thou so lovest
 with all the admired beauties of verona
 go thither and with unattainted eye
 compare her face with some that i shall show
 and i will make thee think thy swan a crow
romeo when the devout religion of mine eye
 maintains such falsehood then turn tears to fires
 and these who often drown'd could never die
 transparent heretics be burnt for liars
 one fairer than my love the allseeing sun
 ne'er saw her match since first the world begun
benvolio tut you saw her fair none else being by
 herself poised with herself in either eye
 but in that crystal scales let there be weigh'd
 your lady's love against some other maid
 that i will show you shining at this feast
 and she shall scant show well that now shows best
romeo i'll go along no such sight to be shown
 but to rejoice in splendor of mine own

 and she was wean'di never shall forget it
 of all the days of the year upon that day
 for i had then laid wormwood to my dug
 sitting in the sun under the dovehouse wall
 my lord and you were then at mantua
 nay i do bear a brainbut as i said
 when it did taste the wormwood on the nipple
 of my dug and felt it bitter pretty fool
 to see it tetchy and fall out with the dug
 shake quoth the dovehouse twas no need i trow
 to bid me trudge
 and since that time it is eleven years
 for then she could stand alone nay by the rood
 she could have run and waddled all about
 for even the day before she broke her brow
 and then my husbandgod be with his soul
 a was a merry mantook up the child
 yea quoth he dost thou fall upon thy face
 thou wilt fall backward when thou hast more wit

 i warrant an i should live a thousand years
 i never should forget it wilt thou not jule quoth he
 and pretty fool it stinted and said ay'
lady capulet enough of this i pray thee hold thy peace
nurse yes madam yet i cannot choose but laugh
 to think it should leave crying and say ay'
 and yet i warrant it had upon its brow
 a bump as big as a young cockerel's stone
 a parlous knock and it cried bitterly
 yea quoth my husband'fall'st upon thy face
 thou wilt fall backward when thou comest to age
 wilt thou not jule it stinted and said ay'
juliet and stint thou too i pray thee nurse say i
nurse peace i have done god mark thee to his grace
 thou wast the prettiest babe that e'er i nursed
 an i might live to see thee married once
 i have my wish
lady capulet marry that marry is the very theme
 i came to talk of tell me daughter juliet
 how stands your disposition to be married
juliet it is an honour that i dream not of
nurse an honour were not i thine only nurse
 i would say thou hadst suck'd wisdom from thy teat
lady capulet well think of marriage now younger than you
 here in verona ladies of esteem
 are made already mothers by my count
 i was your mother much upon these years
 that you are now a maid thus then in brief
 the valiant paris seeks you for his love
nurse a man young lady lady such a man
 as all the worldwhy he's a man of wax
lady capulet verona's summer hath not such a flower
nurse nay he's a flower in faith a very flower
lady capulet what say you can you love the gentleman
 this night you shall behold him at our feast
 read o'er the volume of young paris face
 and find delight writ there with beauty's pen
 examine every married lineament
 and see how one another lends content
 and what obscured in this fair volume lies
 find written in the margent of his eyes
 this precious book of love this unbound lover
 to beautify him only lacks a cover
 the fish lives in the sea and tis much pride
 for fair without the fair within to hide
 that book in many's eyes doth share the glory
 that in gold clasps locks in the golden story
 so shall you share all that he doth possess
 by having him making yourself no less
nurse no less nay bigger women grow by men
lady capulet speak briefly can you like of paris love
juliet i'll look to like if looking liking move
 but no more deep will i endart mine eye
 than your consent gives strength to make it fly
 enter a servant
servant madam the guests are come supper served up you
 called my young lady asked for the nurse cursed in
 the pantry and every thing in extremity i must
 hence to wait i beseech you follow straight
lady capulet we follow thee
 exit servant
 juliet the county stays

act i
scene iv a street
 enter romeo mercutio benvolio with five or six
 maskers torchbearers and others
romeo what shall this speech be spoke for our excuse
 or shall we on without a apology
benvolio the date is out of such prolixity
 we'll have no cupid hoodwink'd with a scarf
 bearing a tartar's painted bow of lath
 scaring the ladies like a crowkeeper
 nor no withoutbook prologue faintly spoke
 after the prompter for our entrance
 but let them measure us by what they will
 we'll measure them a measure and be gone
romeo give me a torch i am not for this ambling
 being but heavy i will bear the light
mercutio nay gentle romeo we must have you dance
romeo not i believe me you have dancing shoes
 with nimble soles i have a soul of lead
 so stakes me to the ground i cannot move
mercutio you are a lover borrow cupid's wings
 and soar with them above a common bound
romeo i am too sore enpierced with his shaft
 to soar with his light feathers and so bound
 i cannot bound a pitch above dull woe
 under love's heavy burden do i sink
mercutio and to sink in it should you burden love
 too great oppression for a tender thing
romeo is love a tender thing it is too rough
 too rude too boisterous and it pricks like thorn
mercutio if love be rough with you be rough with love
 prick love for pricking and you beat love down
 give me a case to put my visage in
 a visor for a visor what care i
 what curious eye doth quote deformities
 here are the beetle brows shall blush for me
benvolio come knock and enter and no sooner in
 but every man betake him to his legs
romeo a torch for me let wantons light of heart
 tickle the senseless rushes with their heels
 for i am proverb'd with a grandsire phrase
 i'll be a candleholder and look on
 the game was ne'er so fair and i am done
mercutio tut dun's the mouse the constable's own word
 if thou art dun we'll draw thee from the mire
 of this sirreverence love wherein thou stick'st
 up to the ears come we burn daylight ho
romeo nay that's not so
