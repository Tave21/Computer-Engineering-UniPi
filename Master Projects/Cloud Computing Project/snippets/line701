 edward the third he bids you then resign
 your crown and kingdom indirectly held
 from him the native and true challenger
king of france or else what follows
exeter bloody constraint for if you hide the crown
 even in your hearts there will he rake for it
 therefore in fierce tempest is he coming
 in thunder and in earthquake like a jove
 that if requiring fail he will compel
 and bids you in the bowels of the lord
 deliver up the crown and to take mercy
 on the poor souls for whom this hungry war
 opens his vasty jaws and on your head
 turning the widows tears the orphans cries
 the dead men's blood the pining maidens groans
 for husbands fathers and betrothed lovers
 that shall be swallow'd in this controversy
 this is his claim his threatening and my message
 unless the dauphin be in presence here
 to whom expressly i bring greeting too
king of france for us we will consider of this further
 tomorrow shall you bear our full intent
 back to our brother england
dauphin for the dauphin
 i stand here for him what to him from england
exeter scorn and defiance slight regard contempt
 and any thing that may not misbecome
 the mighty sender doth he prize you at
 thus says my king an if your father's highness
 do not in grant of all demands at large
 sweeten the bitter mock you sent his majesty
 he'll call you to so hot an answer of it
 that caves and womby vaultages of france
 shall chide your trespass and return your mock
 in second accent of his ordnance
dauphin say if my father render fair return
 it is against my will for i desire
 nothing but odds with england to that end
 as matching to his youth and vanity
 i did present him with the paris balls
exeter he'll make your paris louvre shake for it
 were it the mistresscourt of mighty europe
 and be assured you'll find a difference
 as we his subjects have in wonder found
 between the promise of his greener days
 and these he masters now now he weighs time
 even to the utmost grain that you shall read
 in your own losses if he stay in france
king of france tomorrow shall you know our mind at full
exeter dispatch us with all speed lest that our king
 come here himself to question our delay
 for he is footed in this land already
king of france you shall be soon dispatch's with fair conditions
 a night is but small breath and little pause
 to answer matters of this consequence

act iii
 prologue
 enter chorus
chorus thus with imagined wing our swift scene flies
 in motion of no less celerity
 than that of thought suppose that you have seen
 the wellappointed king at hampton pier
 embark his royalty and his brave fleet
 with silken streamers the young phoebus fanning
 play with your fancies and in them behold
 upon the hempen tackle shipboys climbing
 hear the shrill whistle which doth order give
 to sounds confused behold the threaden sails
 borne with the invisible and creeping wind
 draw the huge bottoms through the furrow'd sea
 breasting the lofty surge o do but think
 you stand upon the ravage and behold
 a city on the inconstant billows dancing
 for so appears this fleet majestical
 holding due course to harfleur follow follow
 grapple your minds to sternage of this navy
 and leave your england as dead midnight still
 guarded with grandsires babies and old women
 either past or not arrived to pith and puissance
 for who is he whose chin is but enrich'd
 with one appearing hair that will not follow
 these cull'd and choicedrawn cavaliers to france
 work work your thoughts and therein see a siege
 behold the ordnance on their carriages
 with fatal mouths gaping on girded harfleur
 suppose the ambassador from the french comes back
 tells harry that the king doth offer him
 katharine his daughter and with her to dowry
 some petty and unprofitable dukedoms
 the offer likes not and the nimble gunner
 with linstock now the devilish cannon touches
 alarum and chambers go off
 and down goes all before them still be kind
 and eke out our performance with your mind

 king henry v
act iii
scene i france before harfleur
 alarum enter king henry exeter bedford
 gloucester and soldiers with scalingladders
king henry v once more unto the breach dear friends once more
 or close the wall up with our english dead
 in peace there's nothing so becomes a man
 as modest stillness and humility
 but when the blast of war blows in our ears
 then imitate the action of the tiger
 stiffen the sinews summon up the blood
 disguise fair nature with hardfavour'd rage
 then lend the eye a terrible aspect
 let pry through the portage of the head
 like the brass cannon let the brow o'erwhelm it
 as fearfully as doth a galled rock
 o'erhang and jutty his confounded base
 swill'd with the wild and wasteful ocean
 now set the teeth and stretch the nostril wide
 hold hard the breath and bend up every spirit
 to his full height on on you noblest english
 whose blood is fet from fathers of warproof
 fathers that like so many alexanders
 have in these parts from morn till even fought
 and sheathed their swords for lack of argument
 dishonour not your mothers now attest
 that those whom you call'd fathers did beget you
 be copy now to men of grosser blood
 and teach them how to war and you good yeoman
 whose limbs were made in england show us here
 the mettle of your pasture let us swear
 that you are worth your breeding which i doubt not
 for there is none of you so mean and base
 that hath not noble lustre in your eyes
 i see you stand like greyhounds in the slips
 straining upon the start the game's afoot
 follow your spirit and upon this charge
 cry god for harry england and saint george'

scene ii the same
 enter nym bardolph pistol and boy
bardolph on on on on on to the breach to the breach
nym pray thee corporal stay the knocks are too hot
 and for mine own part i have not a case of lives
 the humour of it is too hot that is the very
 plainsong of it
pistol the plainsong is most just for humours do abound
 knocks go and come god's vassals drop and die
 and sword and shield
 in bloody field
 doth win immortal fame
boy would i were in an alehouse in london i would give
 all my fame for a pot of ale and safety
pistol and i
 if wishes would prevail with me
 my purpose should not fail with me
 but thither would i hie
boy as duly but not as truly
 as bird doth sing on bough
 enter fluellen
fluellen up to the breach you dogs avaunt you cullions
 driving them forward
pistol be merciful great duke to men of mould
 abate thy rage abate thy manly rage
 abate thy rage great duke
 good bawcock bate thy rage use lenity sweet chuck
nym these be good humours your honour wins bad humours
 exeunt all but boy
boy as young as i am i have observed these three
 swashers i am boy to them all three but all they
 three though they would serve me could not be man
 to me for indeed three such antics do not amount to
 a man for bardolph he is whitelivered and
 redfaced by the means whereof a faces it out but
 fights not for pistol he hath a killing tongue
 and a quiet sword by the means whereof a breaks
 words and keeps whole weapons for nym he hath
 heard that men of few words are the best men and
 therefore he scorns to say his prayers lest a'
 should be thought a coward but his few bad words
 are matched with as few good deeds for a never
 broke any man's head but his own and that was
 against a post when he was drunk they will steal
 any thing and call it purchase bardolph stole a
 lutecase bore it twelve leagues and sold it for
 three half pence nym and bardolph are sworn
 brothers in filching and in calais they stole a
 fireshovel i knew by that piece of service the
 men would carry coals they would have me as
 familiar with men's pockets as their gloves or their
 handkerchers which makes much against my manhood
 if i should take from another's pocket to put into
 mine for it is plain pocketing up of wrongs i
 must leave them and seek some better service
 their villany goes against my weak stomach and
 therefore i must cast it up
 exit
 reenter fluellen gower following
gower captain fluellen you must come presently to the
 mines the duke of gloucester would speak with you
