 who in my mood i stabb'd unto the heart
first outlaw and i for such like petty crimes as these
 but to the purposefor we cite our faults
 that they may hold excus'd our lawless lives
 and partly seeing you are beautified
 with goodly shape and by your own report
 a linguist and a man of such perfection
 as we do in our quality much want
second outlaw indeed because you are a banish'd man
 therefore above the rest we parley to you
 are you content to be our general
 to make a virtue of necessity
 and live as we do in this wilderness
third outlaw what say'st thou wilt thou be of our consort
 say ay and be the captain of us all
 we'll do thee homage and be ruled by thee
 love thee as our commander and our king
first outlaw but if thou scorn our courtesy thou diest
second outlaw thou shalt not live to brag what we have offer'd
valentine i take your offer and will live with you
 provided that you do no outrages
 on silly women or poor passengers
third outlaw no we detest such vile base practises
 come go with us we'll bring thee to our crews
 and show thee all the treasure we have got
 which with ourselves all rest at thy dispose

 the two gentlemen of verona
act iv
scene ii milan outside the duke's palace under silvia's chamber
 enter proteus
proteus already have i been false to valentine
 and now i must be as unjust to thurio
 under the colour of commending him
 i have access my own love to prefer
 but silvia is too fair too true too holy
 to be corrupted with my worthless gifts
 when i protest true loyalty to her
 she twits me with my falsehood to my friend
 when to her beauty i commend my vows
 she bids me think how i have been forsworn
 in breaking faith with julia whom i loved
 and notwithstanding all her sudden quips
 the least whereof would quell a lover's hope
 yet spaniellike the more she spurns my love
 the more it grows and fawneth on her still
 but here comes thurio now must we to her window
 and give some evening music to her ear
 enter thurio and musicians
thurio how now sir proteus are you crept before us
proteus ay gentle thurio for you know that love
 will creep in service where it cannot go
thurio ay but i hope sir that you love not here
proteus sir but i do or else i would be hence
thurio who silvia
proteus ay silvia for your sake
thurio i thank you for your own now gentlemen
 let's tune and to it lustily awhile
 enter at a distance host and julia in boy's clothes
host now my young guest methinks you're allycholly i
 pray you why is it
julia marry mine host because i cannot be merry
host come we'll have you merry i'll bring you where
 you shall hear music and see the gentleman that you asked for
julia but shall i hear him speak
host ay that you shall
julia that will be music
 music plays
host hark hark
julia is he among these
host ay but peace let's hear em
 song
 who is silvia what is she
 that all our swains commend her
 holy fair and wise is she
 the heaven such grace did lend her
 that she might admired be
 is she kind as she is fair
 for beauty lives with kindness
 love doth to her eyes repair
 to help him of his blindness
 and being help'd inhabits there
 then to silvia let us sing
 that silvia is excelling
 she excels each mortal thing
 upon the dull earth dwelling
 to her let us garlands bring
host how now are you sadder than you were before how
 do you man the music likes you not
julia you mistake the musician likes me not
host why my pretty youth
julia he plays false father
host how out of tune on the strings
julia not so but yet so false that he grieves my very
 heartstrings
host you have a quick ear
julia ay i would i were deaf it makes me have a slow heart
host i perceive you delight not in music
julia not a whit when it jars so
host hark what fine change is in the music
julia ay that change is the spite
host you would have them always play but one thing
julia i would always have one play but one thing
 but host doth this sir proteus that we talk on
 often resort unto this gentlewoman
host i tell you what launce his man told me he loved
 her out of all nick
julia where is launce
host gone to seek his dog which tomorrow by his
 master's command he must carry for a present to his lady
julia peace stand aside the company parts
proteus sir thurio fear not you i will so plead
 that you shall say my cunning drift excels
thurio where meet we
proteus at saint gregory's well
thurio farewell
 exeunt thurio and musicians
 enter silvia above
proteus madam good even to your ladyship
silvia i thank you for your music gentlemen
 who is that that spake
proteus one lady if you knew his pure heart's truth
 you would quickly learn to know him by his voice
silvia sir proteus as i take it
proteus sir proteus gentle lady and your servant
silvia what's your will
proteus that i may compass yours
silvia you have your wish my will is even this
 that presently you hie you home to bed
 thou subtle perjured false disloyal man
 think'st thou i am so shallow so conceitless
 to be seduced by thy flattery
 that hast deceived so many with thy vows
 return return and make thy love amends
 for me by this pale queen of night i swear
 i am so far from granting thy request
 that i despise thee for thy wrongful suit
 and by and by intend to chide myself
 even for this time i spend in talking to thee
proteus i grant sweet love that i did love a lady
 but she is dead
julia aside twere false if i should speak it
 for i am sure she is not buried
silvia say that she be yet valentine thy friend
 survives to whom thyself art witness
 i am betroth'd and art thou not ashamed
 to wrong him with thy importunacy
proteus i likewise hear that valentine is dead
silvia and so suppose am i for in his grave
 assure thyself my love is buried
proteus sweet lady let me rake it from the earth
silvia go to thy lady's grave and call hers thence
 or at the least in hers sepulchre thine
julia aside he heard not that
proteus madam if your heart be so obdurate
 vouchsafe me yet your picture for my love
 the picture that is hanging in your chamber
 to that i'll speak to that i'll sigh and weep
 for since the substance of your perfect self
 is else devoted i am but a shadow
 and to your shadow will i make true love
julia aside if twere a substance you would sure
 deceive it
 and make it but a shadow as i am
silvia i am very loath to be your idol sir
 but since your falsehood shall become you well
 to worship shadows and adore false shapes
 send to me in the morning and i'll send it
 and so good rest
proteus as wretches have o'ernight
 that wait for execution in the morn
 exeunt proteus and silvia severally
julia host will you go
host by my halidom i was fast asleep
julia pray you where lies sir proteus
host marry at my house trust me i think tis almost
 day
julia not so but it hath been the longest night
 that e'er i watch'd and the most heaviest
 exeunt
