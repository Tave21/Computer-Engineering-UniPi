 to brabantio
 i did not see you welcome gentle signior
 we lack'd your counsel and your help tonight
brabantio so did i yours good your grace pardon me
 neither my place nor aught i heard of business
 hath raised me from my bed nor doth the general care
 take hold on me for my particular grief
 is of so floodgate and o'erbearing nature
 that it engluts and swallows other sorrows
 and it is still itself
duke of venice why what's the matter
brabantio my daughter o my daughter
duke of venice dead
senator 
brabantio ay to me
 she is abused stol'n from me and corrupted
 by spells and medicines bought of mountebanks
 for nature so preposterously to err
 being not deficient blind or lame of sense
 sans witchcraft could not
duke of venice whoe'er he be that in this foul proceeding
 hath thus beguiled your daughter of herself
 and you of her the bloody book of law
 you shall yourself read in the bitter letter
 after your own sense yea though our proper son
 stood in your action
brabantio humbly i thank your grace
 here is the man this moor whom now it seems
 your special mandate for the stateaffairs
 hath hither brought
duke of venice 
 we are very sorry for't
senator 
duke of venice to othello what in your own part can you say to this
brabantio nothing but this is so
othello most potent grave and reverend signiors
 my very noble and approved good masters
 that i have ta'en away this old man's daughter
 it is most true true i have married her
 the very head and front of my offending
 hath this extent no more rude am i in my speech
 and little bless'd with the soft phrase of peace
 for since these arms of mine had seven years pith
 till now some nine moons wasted they have used
 their dearest action in the tented field
 and little of this great world can i speak
 more than pertains to feats of broil and battle
 and therefore little shall i grace my cause
 in speaking for myself yet by your gracious patience
 i will a round unvarnish'd tale deliver
 of my whole course of love what drugs what charms
 what conjuration and what mighty magic
 for such proceeding i am charged withal
 i won his daughter
brabantio a maiden never bold
 of spirit so still and quiet that her motion
 blush'd at herself and she in spite of nature
 of years of country credit every thing
 to fall in love with what she fear'd to look on
 it is a judgment maim'd and most imperfect
 that will confess perfection so could err
 against all rules of nature and must be driven
 to find out practises of cunning hell
 why this should be i therefore vouch again
 that with some mixtures powerful o'er the blood
 or with some dram conjured to this effect
 he wrought upon her
duke of venice to vouch this is no proof
 without more wider and more overt test
 than these thin habits and poor likelihoods
 of modern seeming do prefer against him
first senator but othello speak
 did you by indirect and forced courses
 subdue and poison this young maid's affections
 or came it by request and such fair question
 as soul to soul affordeth
othello i do beseech you
 send for the lady to the sagittary
 and let her speak of me before her father
 if you do find me foul in her report
 the trust the office i do hold of you
 not only take away but let your sentence
 even fall upon my life
duke of venice fetch desdemona hither
othello ancient conduct them you best know the place
 exeunt iago and attendants
 and till she come as truly as to heaven
 i do confess the vices of my blood
 so justly to your grave ears i'll present
 how i did thrive in this fair lady's love
 and she in mine
duke of venice say it othello
othello her father loved me oft invited me
 still question'd me the story of my life
 from year to year the battles sieges fortunes
 that i have passed
 i ran it through even from my boyish days
 to the very moment that he bade me tell it
 wherein i spake of most disastrous chances
 of moving accidents by flood and field
 of hairbreadth scapes i the imminent deadly breach
 of being taken by the insolent foe
 and sold to slavery of my redemption thence
 and portance in my travels history
 wherein of antres vast and deserts idle
 rough quarries rocks and hills whose heads touch heaven
 it was my hint to speaksuch was the process
 and of the cannibals that each other eat
 the anthropophagi and men whose heads
 do grow beneath their shoulders this to hear
 would desdemona seriously incline
 but still the houseaffairs would draw her thence
 which ever as she could with haste dispatch
 she'ld come again and with a greedy ear
 devour up my discourse which i observing
 took once a pliant hour and found good means
 to draw from her a prayer of earnest heart
 that i would all my pilgrimage dilate
 whereof by parcels she had something heard
 but not intentively i did consent
 and often did beguile her of her tears
 when i did speak of some distressful stroke
 that my youth suffer'd my story being done
 she gave me for my pains a world of sighs
 she swore in faith twas strange twas passing strange
 twas pitiful twas wondrous pitiful
 she wish'd she had not heard it yet she wish'd
 that heaven had made her such a man she thank'd me
 and bade me if i had a friend that loved her
 i should but teach him how to tell my story
 and that would woo her upon this hint i spake
 she loved me for the dangers i had pass'd
 and i loved her that she did pity them
 this only is the witchcraft i have used
 here comes the lady let her witness it
 enter desdemona iago and attendants
duke of venice i think this tale would win my daughter too
 good brabantio
 take up this mangled matter at the best
 men do their broken weapons rather use
 than their bare hands
brabantio i pray you hear her speak
 if she confess that she was half the wooer
 destruction on my head if my bad blame
 light on the man come hither gentle mistress
 do you perceive in all this noble company
 where most you owe obedience
desdemona my noble father
 i do perceive here a divided duty
 to you i am bound for life and education
 my life and education both do learn me
 how to respect you you are the lord of duty
 i am hitherto your daughter but here's my husband
 and so much duty as my mother show'd
 to you preferring you before her father
 so much i challenge that i may profess
 due to the moor my lord
brabantio god be wi you i have done
 please it your grace on to the stateaffairs
 i had rather to adopt a child than get it
 come hither moor
 i here do give thee that with all my heart
 which but thou hast already with all my heart
 i would keep from thee for your sake jewel
 i am glad at soul i have no other child
 for thy escape would teach me tyranny
 to hang clogs on them i have done my lord
duke of venice let me speak like yourself and lay a sentence
 which as a grise or step may help these lovers
 into your favour
 when remedies are past the griefs are ended
 by seeing the worst which late on hopes depended
 to mourn a mischief that is past and gone
 is the next way to draw new mischief on
 what cannot be preserved when fortune takes
 patience her injury a mockery makes
 the robb'd that smiles steals something from the thief
 he robs himself that spends a bootless grief
brabantio so let the turk of cyprus us beguile
 we lose it not so long as we can smile
 he bears the sentence well that nothing bears
 but the free comfort which from thence he hears
 but he bears both the sentence and the sorrow
 that to pay grief must of poor patience borrow
 these sentences to sugar or to gall
 being strong on both sides are equivocal
 but words are words i never yet did hear
 that the bruised heart was pierced through the ear
 i humbly beseech you proceed to the affairs of state
duke of venice the turk with a most mighty preparation makes for
 cyprus othello the fortitude of the place is best
 known to you and though we have there a substitute
 of most allowed sufficiency yet opinion a
 sovereign mistress of effects throws a more safer
 voice on you you must therefore be content to
 slubber the gloss of your new fortunes with this
 more stubborn and boisterous expedition
othello the tyrant custom most grave senators
 hath made the flinty and steel couch of war
 my thricedriven bed of down i do agnise
