 othello
act i
scene ii another street
 enter othello iago and attendants with torches
iago though in the trade of war i have slain men
 yet do i hold it very stuff o the conscience
 to do no contrived murder i lack iniquity
 sometimes to do me service nine or ten times
 i had thought to have yerk'd him here under the ribs
othello tis better as it is
iago nay but he prated
 and spoke such scurvy and provoking terms
 against your honour
 that with the little godliness i have
 i did full hard forbear him but i pray you sir
 are you fast married be assured of this
 that the magnifico is much beloved
 and hath in his effect a voice potential
 as double as the duke's he will divorce you
 or put upon you what restraint and grievance
 the law with all his might to enforce it on
 will give him cable
othello let him do his spite
 my services which i have done the signiory
 shall outtongue his complaints tis yet to know
 which when i know that boasting is an honour
 i shall promulgatei fetch my life and being
 from men of royal siege and my demerits
 may speak unbonneted to as proud a fortune
 as this that i have reach'd for know iago
 but that i love the gentle desdemona
 i would not my unhoused free condition
 put into circumscription and confine
 for the sea's worth but look what lights come yond
iago those are the raised father and his friends
 you were best go in
othello not i i must be found
 my parts my title and my perfect soul
 shall manifest me rightly is it they
iago by janus i think no
 enter cassio and certain officers with torches
othello the servants of the duke and my lieutenant
 the goodness of the night upon you friends
 what is the news
cassio the duke does greet you general
 and he requires your hasteposthaste appearance
 even on the instant
othello what is the matter think you
cassio something from cyprus as i may divine
 it is a business of some heat the galleys
 have sent a dozen sequent messengers
 this very night at one another's heels
 and many of the consuls raised and met
 are at the duke's already you have been
 hotly call'd for
 when being not at your lodging to be found
 the senate hath sent about three several guests
 to search you out
othello tis well i am found by you
 i will but spend a word here in the house
 and go with you
 exit
cassio ancient what makes he here
iago faith he tonight hath boarded a land carack
 if it prove lawful prize he's made for ever
cassio i do not understand
iago he's married
cassio to who
 reenter othello
iago marry tocome captain will you go
othello have with you
cassio here comes another troop to seek for you
iago it is brabantio general be advised
 he comes to bad intent
 enter brabantio roderigo and officers with
 torches and weapons
othello holla stand there
roderigo signior it is the moor
brabantio down with him thief
 they draw on both sides
iago you roderigo come sir i am for you
othello keep up your bright swords for the dew will rust them
 good signior you shall more command with years
 than with your weapons
brabantio o thou foul thief where hast thou stow'd my daughter
 damn'd as thou art thou hast enchanted her
 for i'll refer me to all things of sense
 if she in chains of magic were not bound
 whether a maid so tender fair and happy
 so opposite to marriage that she shunned
 the wealthy curled darlings of our nation
 would ever have to incur a general mock
 run from her guardage to the sooty bosom
 of such a thing as thou to fear not to delight
 judge me the world if tis not gross in sense
 that thou hast practised on her with foul charms
 abused her delicate youth with drugs or minerals
 that weaken motion i'll have't disputed on
 tis probable and palpable to thinking
 i therefore apprehend and do attach thee
 for an abuser of the world a practiser
 of arts inhibited and out of warrant
 lay hold upon him if he do resist
 subdue him at his peril
othello hold your hands
 both you of my inclining and the rest
 were it my cue to fight i should have known it
 without a prompter where will you that i go
 to answer this your charge
brabantio to prison till fit time
 of law and course of direct session
 call thee to answer
othello what if i do obey
 how may the duke be therewith satisfied
 whose messengers are here about my side
 upon some present business of the state
 to bring me to him
first officer tis true most worthy signior
 the duke's in council and your noble self
 i am sure is sent for
brabantio how the duke in council
 in this time of the night bring him away
 mine's not an idle cause the duke himself
 or any of my brothers of the state
 cannot but feel this wrong as twere their own
 for if such actions may have passage free
 bondslaves and pagans shall our statesmen be

 othello
act i
scene iii a councilchamber
 the duke and senators sitting at a table officers
 attending
duke of venice there is no composition in these news
 that gives them credit
first senator indeed they are disproportion'd
 my letters say a hundred and seven galleys
duke of venice and mine a hundred and forty
second senator and mine two hundred
 but though they jump not on a just account
 as in these cases where the aim reports
 tis oft with differenceyet do they all confirm
 a turkish fleet and bearing up to cyprus
duke of venice nay it is possible enough to judgment
 i do not so secure me in the error
 but the main article i do approve
 in fearful sense
sailor within what ho what ho what ho
first officer a messenger from the galleys
 enter a sailor
duke of venice now what's the business
sailor the turkish preparation makes for rhodes
 so was i bid report here to the state
 by signior angelo
duke of venice how say you by this change
first senator this cannot be
 by no assay of reason tis a pageant
 to keep us in false gaze when we consider
 the importancy of cyprus to the turk
 and let ourselves again but understand
 that as it more concerns the turk than rhodes
 so may he with more facile question bear it
 for that it stands not in such warlike brace
 but altogether lacks the abilities
 that rhodes is dress'd in if we make thought of this
 we must not think the turk is so unskilful
 to leave that latest which concerns him first
 neglecting an attempt of ease and gain
 to wake and wage a danger profitless
duke of venice nay in all confidence he's not for rhodes
first officer here is more news
 enter a messenger
messenger the ottomites reverend and gracious
 steering with due course towards the isle of rhodes
 have there injointed them with an after fleet
first senator ay so i thought how many as you guess
messenger of thirty sail and now they do restem
 their backward course bearing with frank appearance
 their purposes toward cyprus signior montano
 your trusty and most valiant servitor
 with his free duty recommends you thus
 and prays you to believe him
duke of venice tis certain then for cyprus
 marcus luccicos is not he in town
first senator he's now in florence
duke of venice write from us to him postposthaste dispatch
first senator here comes brabantio and the valiant moor
 enter brabantio othello iago roderigo and officers
duke of venice valiant othello we must straight employ you
 against the general enemy ottoman
