yea also i continued in the work of this wall neither bought we any land and all my servants were gathered thither unto the work
moreover there were at my table an hundred and fifty of the jews and rulers beside those that came unto us from among the heathen that are about us
now that which was prepared for me daily was one ox and six choice sheep also fowls were prepared for me and once in ten days store of all sorts of wine yet for all this required not i the bread of the governor because the bondage was heavy upon this people
think upon me my god for good according to all that i have done for this people
now it came to pass when sanballat and tobiah and geshem the arabian and the rest of our enemies heard that i had builded the wall and that there was no breach left therein though at that time i had not set up the doors upon the gates
that sanballat and geshem sent unto me saying come let us meet together in some one of the villages in the plain of ono but they thought to do me mischief
and i sent messengers unto them saying i am doing a great work so that i cannot come down why should the work cease whilst i leave it and come down to you
yet they sent unto me four times after this sort and i answered them after the same manner
then sent sanballat his servant unto me in like manner the fifth time with an open letter in his hand
wherein was written it is reported among the heathen and gashmu saith it that thou and the jews think to rebel for which cause thou buildest the wall that thou mayest be their king according to these words
and thou hast also appointed prophets to preach of thee at jerusalem saying there is a king in judah and now shall it be reported to the king according to these words come now therefore and let us take counsel together
then i sent unto him saying there are no such things done as thou sayest but thou feignest them out of thine own heart
for they all made us afraid saying their hands shall be weakened from the work that it be not done now therefore o god strengthen my hands
afterward i came unto the house of shemaiah the son of delaiah the son of mehetabeel who was shut up and he said let us meet together in the house of god within the temple and let us shut the doors of the temple for they will come to slay thee yea in the night will they come to slay thee
and i said should such a man as i flee and who is there that being as i am would go into the temple to save his life i will not go in
and lo i perceived that god had not sent him but that he pronounced this prophecy against me for tobiah and sanballat had hired him
therefore was he hired that i should be afraid and do so and sin and that they might have matter for an evil report that they might reproach me
my god think thou upon tobiah and sanballat according to these their works and on the prophetess noadiah and the rest of the prophets that would have put me in fear
so the wall was finished in the twenty and fifth day of the month elul in fifty and two days
and it came to pass that when all our enemies heard thereof and all the heathen that were about us saw these things they were much cast down in their own eyes for they perceived that this work was wrought of our god
moreover in those days the nobles of judah sent many letters unto tobiah and the letters of tobiah came unto them
for there were many in judah sworn unto him because he was the son in law of shechaniah the son of arah and his son johanan had taken the daughter of meshullam the son of berechiah
also they reported his good deeds before me and uttered my words to him and tobiah sent letters to put me in fear
now it came to pass when the wall was built and i had set up the doors and the porters and the singers and the levites were appointed
that i gave my brother hanani and hananiah the ruler of the palace charge over jerusalem for he was a faithful man and feared god above many
and i said unto them let not the gates of jerusalem be opened until the sun be hot and while they stand by let them shut the doors and bar them and appoint watches of the inhabitants of jerusalem every one in his watch and every one to be over against his house
now the city was large and great but the people were few therein and the houses were not builded
and my god put into mine heart to gather together the nobles and the rulers and the people that they might be reckoned by genealogy and i found a register of the genealogy of them which came up at the first and found written therein
these are the children of the province that went up out of the captivity of those that had been carried away whom nebuchadnezzar the king of babylon had carried away and came again to jerusalem and to judah every one unto his city

the children of delaiah the children of tobiah the children of nekoda six hundred forty and two
and of the priests the children of habaiah the children of koz the children of barzillai which took one of the daughters of barzillai the gileadite to wife and was called after their name
these sought their register among those that were reckoned by genealogy but it was not found therefore were they as polluted put from the priesthood
and the tirshatha said unto them that they should not eat of the most holy things till there stood up a priest with urim and thummim
the whole congregation together was forty and two thousand three hundred and threescore
beside their manservants and their maidservants of whom there were seven thousand three hundred thirty and seven and they had two hundred forty and five singing men and singing women
their horses seven hundred thirty and six their mules two hundred forty and five
their camels four hundred thirty and five six thousand seven hundred and twenty asses
and some of the chief of the fathers gave unto the work the tirshatha gave to the treasure a thousand drams of gold fifty basons five hundred and thirty priests garments
and some of the chief of the fathers gave to the treasure of the work twenty thousand drams of gold and two thousand and two hundred pound of silver
and that which the rest of the people gave was twenty thousand drams of gold and two thousand pound of silver and threescore and seven priests garments
so the priests and the levites and the porters and the singers and some of the people and the nethinims and all israel dwelt in their cities and when the seventh month came the children of israel were in their cities
and all the people gathered themselves together as one man into the street that was before the water gate and they spake unto ezra the scribe to bring the book of the law of moses which the lord had commanded to israel
and ezra the priest brought the law before the congregation both of men and women and all that could hear with understanding upon the first day of the seventh month
and he read therein before the street that was before the water gate from the morning until midday before the men and the women and those that could understand and the ears of all the people were attentive unto the book of the law
and ezra the scribe stood upon a pulpit of wood which they had made for the purpose and beside him stood mattithiah and shema and anaiah and urijah and hilkiah and maaseiah on his right hand and on his left hand pedaiah and mishael and malchiah and hashum and hashbadana zechariah and meshullam
and ezra opened the book in the sight of all the people for he was above all the people and when he opened it all the people stood up
and ezra blessed the lord the great god and all the people answered amen amen with lifting up their hands and they bowed their heads and worshipped the lord with their faces to the ground
also jeshua and bani and sherebiah jamin akkub shabbethai hodijah maaseiah kelita azariah jozabad hanan pelaiah and the levites caused the people to understand the law and the people stood in their place
so they read in the book in the law of god distinctly and gave the sense and caused them to understand the reading
and nehemiah which is the tirshatha and ezra the priest the scribe and the levites that taught the people said unto all the people this day is holy unto the lord your god mourn not nor weep for all the people wept when they heard the words of the law
then he said unto them go your way eat the fat and drink the sweet and send portions unto them for whom nothing is prepared for this day is holy unto our lord neither be ye sorry for the joy of the lord is your strength
so the levites stilled all the people saying hold your peace for the day is holy neither be ye grieved
and all the people went their way to eat and to drink and to send portions and to make great mirth because they had understood the words that were declared unto them
and on the second day were gathered together the chief of the fathers of all the people the priests and the levites unto ezra the scribe even to understand the words of the law
and they found written in the law which the lord had commanded by moses that the children of israel should dwell in booths in the feast of the seventh month
and that they should publish and proclaim in all their cities and in jerusalem saying go forth unto the mount and fetch olive branches and pine branches and myrtle branches and palm branches and branches of thick trees to make booths as it is written
so the people went forth and brought them and made themselves booths every one upon the roof of his house and in their courts and in the courts of the house of god and in the street of the water gate and in the street of the gate of ephraim
and all the congregation of them that were come again out of the captivity made booths and sat under the booths for since the days of jeshua the son of nun unto that day had not the children of israel done so and there was very great gladness
also day by day from the first day unto the last day he read in the book of the law of god and they kept the feast seven days and on the eighth day was a solemn assembly according unto the manner
now in the twenty and fourth day of this month the children of israel were assembled with fasting and with sackclothes and earth upon them
and the seed of israel separated themselves from all strangers and stood and confessed their sins and the iniquities of their fathers
and they stood up in their place and read in the book of the law of the lord their god one fourth part of the day and another fourth part they confessed and worshipped the lord their god
then stood up upon the stairs of the levites jeshua and bani kadmiel shebaniah bunni sherebiah bani and chenani and cried with a loud voice unto the lord their god
then the levites jeshua and kadmiel bani hashabniah sherebiah hodijah shebaniah and pethahiah said stand up and bless the lord your god for ever and ever and blessed be thy glorious name which is exalted above all blessing and praise
thou even thou art lord alone thou hast made heaven the heaven of heavens with all their host the earth and all things that are therein the seas and all that is therein and thou preservest them all and the host of heaven worshippeth thee
thou art the lord the god who didst choose abram and broughtest him forth out of ur of the chaldees and gavest him the name of abraham
and foundest his heart faithful before thee and madest a covenant with him to give the land of the canaanites the hittites the amorites and the perizzites and the jebusites and the girgashites to give it i say to his seed and hast performed thy words for thou art righteous
and didst see the affliction of our fathers in egypt and heardest their cry by the red sea
and shewedst signs and wonders upon pharaoh and on all his servants and on all the people of his land for thou knewest that they dealt proudly against them so didst thou get thee a name as it is this day
and thou didst divide the sea before them so that they went through the midst of the sea on the dry land and their persecutors thou threwest into the deeps as a stone into the mighty waters
moreover thou leddest them in the day by a cloudy pillar and in the night by a pillar of fire to give them light in the way wherein they should go
thou camest down also upon mount sinai and spakest with them from heaven and gavest them right judgments and true laws good statutes and commandments
and madest known unto them thy holy sabbath and commandedst them precepts statutes and laws by the hand of moses thy servant
and gavest them bread from heaven for their hunger and broughtest forth water for them out of the rock for their thirst and promisedst them that they should go in to possess the land which thou hadst sworn to give them
but they and our fathers dealt proudly and hardened their necks and hearkened not to thy commandments
and refused to obey neither were mindful of thy wonders that thou didst among them but hardened their necks and in their rebellion appointed a captain to return to their bondage but thou art a god ready to pardon gracious and merciful slow to anger and of great kindness and forsookest them not
yea when they had made them a molten calf and said this is thy god that brought thee up out of egypt and had wrought great provocations
yet thou in thy manifold mercies forsookest them not in the wilderness the pillar of the cloud departed not from them by day to lead them in the way neither the pillar of fire by night to shew them light and the way wherein they should go
thou gavest also thy good spirit to instruct them and withheldest not thy manna from their mouth and gavest them water for their thirst
yea forty years didst thou sustain them in the wilderness so that they lacked nothing their clothes waxed not old and their feet swelled not
moreover thou gavest them kingdoms and nations and didst divide them into corners so they possessed the land of sihon and the land of the king of heshbon and the land of og king of bashan
their children also multipliedst thou as the stars of heaven and broughtest them into the land concerning which thou hadst promised to their fathers that they should go in to possess it
so the children went in and possessed the land and thou subduedst before them the inhabitants of the land the canaanites and gavest them into their hands with their kings and the people of the land that they might do with them as they would
and they took strong cities and a fat land and possessed houses full of all goods wells digged vineyards and oliveyards and fruit trees in abundance so they did eat and were filled and became fat and delighted themselves in thy great goodness
nevertheless they were disobedient and rebelled against thee and cast thy law behind their backs and slew thy prophets which testified against them to turn them to thee and they wrought great provocations
therefore thou deliveredst them into the hand of their enemies who vexed them and in the time of their trouble when they cried unto thee thou heardest them from heaven and according to thy manifold mercies thou gavest them saviours who saved them out of the hand of their enemies
but after they had rest they did evil again before thee therefore leftest thou them in the hand of their enemies so that they had the dominion over them yet when they returned and cried unto thee thou heardest them from heaven and many times didst thou deliver them according to thy mercies
and testifiedst against them that thou mightest bring them again unto thy law yet they dealt proudly and hearkened not unto thy commandments but sinned against thy judgments which if a man do he shall live in them and withdrew the shoulder and hardened their neck and would not hear
yet many years didst thou forbear them and testifiedst against them by thy spirit in thy prophets yet would they not give ear therefore gavest thou them into the hand of the people of the lands
nevertheless for thy great mercies sake thou didst not utterly consume them nor forsake them for thou art a gracious and merciful god
now therefore our god the great the mighty and the terrible god who keepest covenant and mercy let not all the trouble seem little before thee that hath come upon us on our kings on our princes and on our priests and on our prophets and on our fathers and on all thy people since the time of the kings of assyria unto this day
howbeit thou art just in all that is brought upon us for thou hast done right but we have done wickedly
neither have our kings our princes our priests nor our fathers kept thy law nor hearkened unto thy commandments and thy testimonies wherewith thou didst testify against them
for they have not served thee in their kingdom and in thy great goodness that thou gavest them and in the large and fat land which thou gavest before them neither turned they from their wicked works
behold we are servants this day and for the land that thou gavest unto our fathers to eat the fruit thereof and the good thereof behold we are servants in it
and it yieldeth much increase unto the kings whom thou hast set over us because of our sins also they have dominion over our bodies and over our cattle at their pleasure and we are in great distress
and because of all this we make a sure covenant and write it and our princes levites and priests seal unto it

and the rest of the people the priests the levites the porters the singers the nethinims and all they that had separated themselves from the people of the lands unto the law of god their wives their sons and their daughters every one having knowledge and having understanding
they clave to their brethren their nobles and entered into a curse and into an oath to walk in god's law which was given by moses the servant of god and to observe and do all the commandments of the lord our lord and his judgments and his statutes
and that we would not give our daughters unto the people of the land nor take their daughters for our sons
and if the people of the land bring ware or any victuals on the sabbath day to sell that we would not buy it of them on the sabbath or on the holy day and that we would leave the seventh year and the exaction of every debt
also we made ordinances for us to charge ourselves yearly with the third part of a shekel for the service of the house of our god
for the shewbread and for the continual meat offering and for the continual burnt offering of the sabbaths of the new moons for the set feasts and for the holy things and for the sin offerings to make an atonement for israel and for all the work of the house of our god
and we cast the lots among the priests the levites and the people for the wood offering to bring it into the house of our god after the houses of our fathers at times appointed year by year to burn upon the altar of the lord our god as it is written in the law
and to bring the firstfruits of our ground and the firstfruits of all fruit of all trees year by year unto the house of the lord
also the firstborn of our sons and of our cattle as it is written in the law and the firstlings of our herds and of our flocks to bring to the house of our god unto the priests that minister in the house of our god
and that we should bring the firstfruits of our dough and our offerings and the fruit of all manner of trees of wine and of oil unto the priests to the chambers of the house of our god and the tithes of our ground unto the levites that the same levites might have the tithes in all the cities of our tillage
and the priest the son of aaron shall be with the levites when the levites take tithes and the levites shall bring up the tithe of the tithes unto the house of our god to the chambers into the treasure house
for the children of israel and the children of levi shall bring the offering of the corn of the new wine and the oil unto the chambers where are the vessels of the sanctuary and the priests that minister and the porters and the singers and we will not forsake the house of our god
and the rulers of the people dwelt at jerusalem the rest of the people also cast lots to bring one of ten to dwell in jerusalem the holy city and nine parts to dwell in other cities
and the people blessed all the men that willingly offered themselves to dwell at jerusalem
now these are the chief of the province that dwelt in jerusalem but in the cities of judah dwelt every one in his possession in their cities to wit israel the priests and the levites and the nethinims and the children of solomon's servants
and at jerusalem dwelt certain of the children of judah and of the children of benjamin of the children of judah athaiah the son of uzziah the son of zechariah the son of amariah the son of shephatiah the son of mahalaleel of the children of perez
