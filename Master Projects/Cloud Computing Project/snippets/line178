 tenderbodied and the only son of my womb when
 youth with comeliness plucked all gaze his way when
 for a day of kings entreaties a mother should not
 sell him an hour from her beholding i considering
 how honour would become such a person that it was
 no better than picturelike to hang by the wall if
 renown made it not stir was pleased to let him seek
 danger where he was like to find fame to a cruel
 war i sent him from whence he returned his brows
 bound with oak i tell thee daughter i sprang not
 more in joy at first hearing he was a manchild
 than now in first seeing he had proved himself a
 man
virgilia but had he died in the business madam how then
volumnia then his good report should have been my son i
 therein would have found issue hear me profess
 sincerely had i a dozen sons each in my love
 alike and none less dear than thine and my good
 marcius i had rather had eleven die nobly for their
 country than one voluptuously surfeit out of action
 enter a gentlewoman
gentlewoman madam the lady valeria is come to visit you
virgilia beseech you give me leave to retire myself
volumnia indeed you shall not
 methinks i hear hither your husband's drum
 see him pluck aufidius down by the hair
 as children from a bear the volsces shunning him
 methinks i see him stamp thus and call thus
 come on you cowards you were got in fear
 though you were born in rome his bloody brow
 with his mail'd hand then wiping forth he goes
 like to a harvestman that's task'd to mow
 or all or lose his hire
virgilia his bloody brow o jupiter no blood
volumnia away you fool it more becomes a man
 than gilt his trophy the breasts of hecuba
 when she did suckle hector look'd not lovelier
 than hector's forehead when it spit forth blood
 at grecian sword contemning tell valeria
 we are fit to bid her welcome
 exit gentlewoman
virgilia heavens bless my lord from fell aufidius
volumnia he'll beat aufidius head below his knee
 and tread upon his neck
 enter valeria with an usher and gentlewoman
valeria my ladies both good day to you
volumnia sweet madam
virgilia i am glad to see your ladyship
valeria how do you both you are manifest housekeepers
 what are you sewing here a fine spot in good
 faith how does your little son
virgilia i thank your ladyship well good madam
volumnia he had rather see the swords and hear a drum than
 look upon his schoolmaster
valeria o my word the father's son i'll swear'tis a
 very pretty boy o my troth i looked upon him o'
 wednesday half an hour together has such a
 confirmed countenance i saw him run after a gilded
 butterfly and when he caught it he let it go
 again and after it again and over and over he
 comes and again catched it again or whether his
 fall enraged him or how twas he did so set his
 teeth and tear it o i warrant it how he mammocked
 it
volumnia one on s father's moods
valeria indeed la tis a noble child
virgilia a crack madam

 the idle husewife with me this afternoon

virgilia i will wish her speedy strength and visit her with
 my prayers but i cannot go thither

 exeunt
 coriolanus
act i
scene iv before corioli
 enter with drum and colours marcius titus
 lartius captains and soldiers to them a
 messenger
marcius yonder comes news a wager they have met
lartius my horse to yours no
marcius tis done
lartius agreed
marcius say has our general met the enemy
messenger they lie in view but have not spoke as yet
lartius so the good horse is mine
marcius i'll buy him of you
lartius no i'll nor sell nor give him lend you him i will
 for half a hundred years summon the town
marcius how far off lie these armies
messenger within this mile and half
marcius then shall we hear their larum and they ours
 now mars i prithee make us quick in work
 that we with smoking swords may march from hence
 to help our fielded friends come blow thy blast
 they sound a parley enter two senators with others
 on the walls
 tutus aufidius is he within your walls
first senator no nor a man that fears you less than he
 that's lesser than a little
 drums afar off
 hark our drums
 are bringing forth our youth we'll break our walls
 rather than they shall pound us up our gates
 which yet seem shut we have but pinn'd with rushes
 they'll open of themselves
 alarum afar off
 hark you far off
 there is aufidius list what work he makes
 amongst your cloven army
marcius o they are at it
lartius their noise be our instruction ladders ho
 enter the army of the volsces
marcius they fear us not but issue forth their city
 now put your shields before your hearts and fight
 with hearts more proof than shields advance
 brave titus
 they do disdain us much beyond our thoughts
 which makes me sweat with wrath come on my fellows
 he that retires i'll take him for a volsce
 and he shall feel mine edge
 alarum the romans are beat back to their
 trenches reenter marcius cursing
marcius all the contagion of the south light on you
 you shames of rome you herd ofboils and plagues
 plaster you o'er that you may be abhorr'd
 further than seen and one infect another
 against the wind a mile you souls of geese
 that bear the shapes of men how have you run
 from slaves that apes would beat pluto and hell
 all hurt behind backs red and faces pale
 with flight and agued fear mend and charge home
 or by the fires of heaven i'll leave the foe
 and make my wars on you look to't come on
 if you'll stand fast we'll beat them to their wives
 as they us to our trenches followed
 another alarum the volsces fly and marcius
 follows them to the gates
 so now the gates are ope now prove good seconds
 tis for the followers fortune widens them
 not for the fliers mark me and do the like
 enters the gates
first soldier foolhardiness not i
second soldier nor i
 marcius is shut in
first soldier see they have shut him in
all to the pot i warrant him
 alarum continues
 reenter titus lartius
lartius what is become of marcius
all slain sir doubtless
first soldier following the fliers at the very heels
 with them he enters who upon the sudden
 clapp'd to their gates he is himself alone
 to answer all the city
lartius o noble fellow
 who sensibly outdares his senseless sword
 and when it bows stands up thou art left marcius
 a carbuncle entire as big as thou art
 were not so rich a jewel thou wast a soldier
 even to cato's wish not fierce and terrible
 only in strokes but with thy grim looks and
 the thunderlike percussion of thy sounds
