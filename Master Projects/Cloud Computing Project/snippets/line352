nor taste nor smell desire to be invited
to any sensual feast with thee alone
but my five wits nor my five senses can
dissuade one foolish heart from serving thee
who leaves unsway'd the likeness of a man
thy proud hearts slave and vassal wretch to be
 only my plague thus far i count my gain
 that she that makes me sin awards me pain
cxlii
love is my sin and thy dear virtue hate
hate of my sin grounded on sinful loving
o but with mine compare thou thine own state
and thou shalt find it merits not reproving
or if it do not from those lips of thine
that have profaned their scarlet ornaments
and seal'd false bonds of love as oft as mine
robb'd others beds revenues of their rents
be it lawful i love thee as thou lovest those
whom thine eyes woo as mine importune thee
root pity in thy heart that when it grows
thy pity may deserve to pitied be
 if thou dost seek to have what thou dost hide
 by selfexample mayst thou be denied
cxliii
lo as a careful housewife runs to catch
one of her feather'd creatures broke away
sets down her babe and makes an swift dispatch
in pursuit of the thing she would have stay
whilst her neglected child holds her in chase
cries to catch her whose busy care is bent
to follow that which flies before her face
not prizing her poor infant's discontent
so runn'st thou after that which flies from thee
whilst i thy babe chase thee afar behind
but if thou catch thy hope turn back to me
and play the mother's part kiss me be kind
 so will i pray that thou mayst have thy will'
 if thou turn back and my loud crying still
cxliv
two loves i have of comfort and despair
which like two spirits do suggest me still
the better angel is a man right fair
the worser spirit a woman colour'd ill
to win me soon to hell my female evil
tempteth my better angel from my side
and would corrupt my saint to be a devil
wooing his purity with her foul pride
and whether that my angel be turn'd fiend
suspect i may but not directly tell
but being both from me both to each friend
i guess one angel in another's hell
 yet this shall i ne'er know but live in doubt
 till my bad angel fire my good one out
cxlv
those lips that love's own hand did make
breathed forth the sound that said i hate'
to me that languish'd for her sake
but when she saw my woeful state
straight in her heart did mercy come
chiding that tongue that ever sweet
was used in giving gentle doom
and taught it thus anew to greet
'i hate she alter'd with an end
that follow'd it as gentle day
doth follow night who like a fiend
from heaven to hell is flown away
 i hate from hate away she threw
 and saved my life saying not you'
cxlvi
poor soul the centre of my sinful earth
 these rebel powers that thee array
why dost thou pine within and suffer dearth
painting thy outward walls so costly gay
why so large cost having so short a lease
dost thou upon thy fading mansion spend
shall worms inheritors of this excess
eat up thy charge is this thy body's end
then soul live thou upon thy servant's loss
and let that pine to aggravate thy store
buy terms divine in selling hours of dross
within be fed without be rich no more
 so shalt thou feed on death that feeds on men
 and death once dead there's no more dying then
cxlvii
my love is as a fever longing still
for that which longer nurseth the disease
feeding on that which doth preserve the ill
the uncertain sickly appetite to please
my reason the physician to my love
angry that his prescriptions are not kept
hath left me and i desperate now approve
desire is death which physic did except
past cure i am now reason is past care
and franticmad with evermore unrest
my thoughts and my discourse as madmen's are
at random from the truth vainly express'd
 for i have sworn thee fair and thought thee bright
 who art as black as hell as dark as night
cxlviii
o me what eyes hath love put in my head
which have no correspondence with true sight
or if they have where is my judgment fled
that censures falsely what they see aright
if that be fair whereon my false eyes dote
what means the world to say it is not so
if it be not then love doth well denote
love's eye is not so true as all men's no'
how can it o how can love's eye be true
that is so vex'd with watching and with tears
no marvel then though i mistake my view
the sun itself sees not till heaven clears
 o cunning love with tears thou keep'st me blind
 lest eyes wellseeing thy foul faults should find
cxlix
canst thou o cruel say i love thee not
when i against myself with thee partake
do i not think on thee when i forgot
am of myself all tyrant for thy sake
who hateth thee that i do call my friend
on whom frown'st thou that i do fawn upon
nay if thou lour'st on me do i not spend
revenge upon myself with present moan
what merit do i in myself respect
that is so proud thy service to despise
when all my best doth worship thy defect
commanded by the motion of thine eyes
 but love hate on for now i know thy mind
 those that can see thou lovest and i am blind
cl
o from what power hast thou this powerful might
with insufficiency my heart to sway
to make me give the lie to my true sight
and swear that brightness doth not grace the day
whence hast thou this becoming of things ill
that in the very refuse of thy deeds
there is such strength and warrantize of skill
that in my mind thy worst all best exceeds
who taught thee how to make me love thee more
the more i hear and see just cause of hate
o though i love what others do abhor
with others thou shouldst not abhor my state
 if thy unworthiness raised love in me
 more worthy i to be beloved of thee
cli
love is too young to know what conscience is
yet who knows not conscience is born of love
then gentle cheater urge not my amiss
lest guilty of my faults thy sweet self prove
for thou betraying me i do betray
my nobler part to my gross body's treason
my soul doth tell my body that he may
triumph in love flesh stays no father reason
but rising at thy name doth point out thee
as his triumphant prize proud of this pride
he is contented thy poor drudge to be
to stand in thy affairs fall by thy side
 no want of conscience hold it that i call
 her love for whose dear love i rise and fall
clii
in loving thee thou know'st i am forsworn
but thou art twice forsworn to me love swearing
in act thy bedvow broke and new faith torn
in vowing new hate after new love bearing
but why of two oaths breach do i accuse thee
when i break twenty i am perjured most
for all my vows are oaths but to misuse thee
and all my honest faith in thee is lost
for i have sworn deep oaths of thy deep kindness
oaths of thy love thy truth thy constancy
and to enlighten thee gave eyes to blindness
or made them swear against the thing they see
 for i have sworn thee fair more perjured i
 to swear against the truth so foul a lie
cliii
cupid laid by his brand and fell asleep
a maid of dian's this advantage found
and his lovekindling fire did quickly steep
in a cold valleyfountain of that ground
which borrow'd from this holy fire of love
a dateless lively heat still to endure
and grew a seething bath which yet men prove
against strange maladies a sovereign cure
but at my mistress eye love's brand newfired
the boy for trial needs would touch my breast
i sick withal the help of bath desired
and thither hied a sad distemper'd guest
 but found no cure the bath for my help lies
 where cupid got new firemy mistress eyes

the little lovegod lying once asleep
laid by his side his heartinflaming brand
whilst many nymphs that vow'd chaste life to keep
came tripping by but in her maiden hand
the fairest votary took up that fire
which many legions of true hearts had warm'd
and so the general of hot desire
was sleeping by a virgin hand disarm'd
this brand she quenched in a cool well by
which from love's fire took heat perpetual
growing a bath and healthful remedy
