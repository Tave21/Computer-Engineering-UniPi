 tonguetied ambition not replying yielded
 to bear the golden yoke of sovereignty
 which fondly you would here impose on me
 if to reprove you for this suit of yours
 so season'd with your faithful love to me
 then on the other side i cheque'd my friends
 therefore to speak and to avoid the first
 and then in speaking not to incur the last
 definitively thus i answer you
 your love deserves my thanks but my desert
 unmeritable shuns your high request
 first if all obstacles were cut away
 and that my path were even to the crown
 as my ripe revenue and due by birth
 yet so much is my poverty of spirit
 so mighty and so many my defects
 as i had rather hide me from my greatness
 being a bark to brook no mighty sea
 than in my greatness covet to be hid
 and in the vapour of my glory smother'd
 but god be thank'd there's no need of me
 and much i need to help you if need were
 the royal tree hath left us royal fruit
 which mellow'd by the stealing hours of time
 will well become the seat of majesty
 and make no doubt us happy by his reign
 on him i lay what you would lay on me
 the right and fortune of his happy stars
 which god defend that i should wring from him
buckingham my lord this argues conscience in your grace
 but the respects thereof are nice and trivial
 all circumstances well considered
 you say that edward is your brother's son
 so say we too but not by edward's wife
 for first he was contract to lady lucy
 your mother lives a witness to that vow
 and afterward by substitute betroth'd
 to bona sister to the king of france
 these both put by a poor petitioner
 a carecrazed mother of a many children
 a beautywaning and distressed widow
 even in the afternoon of her best days
 made prize and purchase of his lustful eye
 seduced the pitch and height of all his thoughts
 to base declension and loathed bigamy
 by her in his unlawful bed he got
 this edward whom our manners term the prince
 more bitterly could i expostulate
 save that for reverence to some alive
 i give a sparing limit to my tongue
 then good my lord take to your royal self
 this proffer'd benefit of dignity
 if non to bless us and the land withal
 yet to draw forth your noble ancestry
 from the corruption of abusing times
 unto a lineal truederived course
lord mayor do good my lord your citizens entreat you
buckingham refuse not mighty lord this proffer'd love
catesby o make them joyful grant their lawful suit
gloucester alas why would you heap these cares on me
 i am unfit for state and majesty
 i do beseech you take it not amiss
 i cannot nor i will not yield to you
buckingham if you refuse itas in love and zeal
 loath to depose the child your brother's son
 as well we know your tenderness of heart
 and gentle kind effeminate remorse
 which we have noted in you to your kin
 and egally indeed to all estates
 yet whether you accept our suit or no
 your brother's son shall never reign our king
 but we will plant some other in the throne
 to the disgrace and downfall of your house
 and in this resolution here we leave you
 come citizens zounds i'll entreat no more
gloucester o do not swear my lord of buckingham
 exit buckingham with the citizens
catesby call them again my lord and accept their suit
another do good my lord lest all the land do rue it
gloucester would you enforce me to a world of care
 well call them again i am not made of stone
 but penetrable to your kind entreats
 albeit against my conscience and my soul
 reenter buckingham and the rest
 cousin of buckingham and you sage grave men
 since you will buckle fortune on my back
 to bear her burthen whether i will or no
 i must have patience to endure the load
 but if black scandal or foulfaced reproach
 attend the sequel of your imposition
 your mere enforcement shall acquittance me
 from all the impure blots and stains thereof
 for god he knows and you may partly see
 how far i am from the desire thereof
lord mayor god bless your grace we see it and will say it
gloucester in saying so you shall but say the truth
buckingham then i salute you with this kingly title
 long live richard england's royal king
lord mayor 
 amen
citizens 
buckingham tomorrow will it please you to be crown'd
gloucester even when you please since you will have it so
buckingham tomorrow then we will attend your grace
 and so most joyfully we take our leave
gloucester come let us to our holy task again
 farewell good cousin farewell gentle friends

lord stanley let me but meet you ladies one hour hence
 and i'll salute your grace of york as mother
 and reverend looker on of two fair queens
 to lady anne
 come madam you must straight to westminster
 there to be crowned richard's royal queen
queen elizabeth o cut my lace in sunder that my pent heart
 may have some scope to beat or else i swoon
 with this deadkilling news
lady anne despiteful tidings o unpleasing news
dorset be of good cheer mother how fares your grace
queen elizabeth o dorset speak not to me get thee hence
 death and destruction dog thee at the heels
 thy mother's name is ominous to children
 if thou wilt outstrip death go cross the seas
 and live with richmond from the reach of hell
 go hie thee hie thee from this slaughterhouse
 lest thou increase the number of the dead
 and make me die the thrall of margaret's curse
 nor mother wife nor england's counted queen
lord stanley full of wise care is this your counsel madam
 take all the swift advantage of the hours
 you shall have letters from me to my son
 to meet you on the way and welcome you
 be not ta'en tardy by unwise delay
duchess of york o illdispersing wind of misery
 o my accursed womb the bed of death
 a cockatrice hast thou hatch'd to the world
 whose unavoided eye is murderous
lord stanley come madam come i in all haste was sent
lady anne and i in all unwillingness will go
 i would to god that the inclusive verge
 of golden metal that must round my brow
 were redhot steel to sear me to the brain
 anointed let me be with deadly venom
 and die ere men can say god save the queen
queen elizabeth go go poor soul i envy not thy glory
 to feed my humour wish thyself no harm
lady anne no why when he that is my husband now
 came to me as i follow'd henry's corse
 when scarce the blood was well wash'd from his hands
 which issued from my other angel husband
 and that dead saint which then i weeping follow'd
 o when i say i look'd on richard's face
 this was my wish be thou quoth i  accursed
 for making me so young so old a widow
 and when thou wed'st let sorrow haunt thy bed
 and be thy wifeif any be so mad
 as miserable by the life of thee
 as thou hast made me by my dear lord's death
 lo ere i can repeat this curse again
 even in so short a space my woman's heart
 grossly grew captive to his honey words
