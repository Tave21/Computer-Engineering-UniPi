2ki2333 and pharaohnechoh put him in bands at riblah in the land of hamath that he might not reign in jerusalem and put the land to a tribute of an hundred talents of silver and a talent of gold
2ki2334 and pharaohnechoh made eliakim the son of josiah king in the room of josiah his father and turned his name to jehoiakim and took jehoahaz away and he came to egypt and died there
2ki2335 and jehoiakim gave the silver and the gold to pharaoh but he taxed the land to give the money according to the commandment of pharaoh he exacted the silver and the gold of the people of the land of every one according to his taxation to give it unto pharaohnechoh
2ki2336 jehoiakim was twenty and five years old when he began to reign and he reigned eleven years in jerusalem and his mother's name was zebudah the daughter of pedaiah of rumah
2ki2337 and he did that which was evil in the sight of the lord according to all that his fathers had done
2ki241 in his days nebuchadnezzar king of babylon came up and jehoiakim became his servant three years then he turned and rebelled against him
2ki242 and the lord sent against him bands of the chaldees and bands of the syrians and bands of the moabites and bands of the children of ammon and sent them against judah to destroy it according to the word of the lord which he spake by his servants the prophets
2ki243 surely at the commandment of the lord came this upon judah to remove them out of his sight for the sins of manasseh according to all that he did
2ki244 and also for the innocent blood that he shed for he filled jerusalem with innocent blood which the lord would not pardon
2ki245 now the rest of the acts of jehoiakim and all that he did are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of judah
2ki246 so jehoiakim slept with his fathers and jehoiachin his son reigned in his stead
2ki247 and the king of egypt came not again any more out of his land for the king of babylon had taken from the river of egypt unto the river euphrates all that pertained to the king of egypt
2ki248 jehoiachin was eighteen years old when he began to reign and he reigned in jerusalem three months and his mother's name was nehushta the daughter of elnathan of jerusalem
2ki249 and he did that which was evil in the sight of the lord according to all that his father had done
2ki2410 at that time the servants of nebuchadnezzar king of babylon came up against jerusalem and the city was besieged
2ki2411 and nebuchadnezzar king of babylon came against the city and his servants did besiege it
2ki2412 and jehoiachin the king of judah went out to the king of babylon he and his mother and his servants and his princes and his officers and the king of babylon took him in the eighth year of his reign
2ki2413 and he carried out thence all the treasures of the house of the lord and the treasures of the king's house and cut in pieces all the vessels of gold which solomon king of israel had made in the temple of the lord as the lord had said
2ki2414 and he carried away all jerusalem and all the princes and all the mighty men of valour even ten thousand captives and all the craftsmen and smiths none remained save the poorest sort of the people of the land
2ki2415 and he carried away jehoiachin to babylon and the king's mother and the king's wives and his officers and the mighty of the land those carried he into captivity from jerusalem to babylon
2ki2416 and all the men of might even seven thousand and craftsmen and smiths a thousand all that were strong and apt for war even them the king of babylon brought captive to babylon
2ki2417 and the king of babylon made mattaniah his father's brother king in his stead and changed his name to zedekiah
2ki2418 zedekiah was twenty and one years old when he began to reign and he reigned eleven years in jerusalem and his mother's name was hamutal the daughter of jeremiah of libnah
2ki2419 and he did that which was evil in the sight of the lord according to all that jehoiakim had done
2ki2420 for through the anger of the lord it came to pass in jerusalem and judah until he had cast them out from his presence that zedekiah rebelled against the king of babylon
2ki251 and it came to pass in the ninth year of his reign in the tenth month in the tenth day of the month that nebuchadnezzar king of babylon came he and all his host against jerusalem and pitched against it and they built forts against it round about
2ki252 and the city was besieged unto the eleventh year of king zedekiah
2ki253 and on the ninth day of the fourth month the famine prevailed in the city and there was no bread for the people of the land
2ki254 and the city was broken up and all the men of war fled by night by the way of the gate between two walls which is by the king's garden now the chaldees were against the city round about and the king went the way toward the plain
2ki255 and the army of the chaldees pursued after the king and overtook him in the plains of jericho and all his army were scattered from him
2ki256 so they took the king and brought him up to the king of babylon to riblah and they gave judgment upon him
2ki257 and they slew the sons of zedekiah before his eyes and put out the eyes of zedekiah and bound him with fetters of brass and carried him to babylon
2ki258 and in the fifth month on the seventh day of the month which is the nineteenth year of king nebuchadnezzar king of babylon came nebuzaradan captain of the guard a servant of the king of babylon unto jerusalem
2ki259 and he burnt the house of the lord and the king's house and all the houses of jerusalem and every great man's house burnt he with fire
2ki2510 and all the army of the chaldees that were with the captain of the guard brake down the walls of jerusalem round about
2ki2511 now the rest of the people that were left in the city and the fugitives that fell away to the king of babylon with the remnant of the multitude did nebuzaradan the captain of the guard carry away
2ki2512 but the captain of the guard left of the poor of the land to be vinedressers and husbandmen
2ki2513 and the pillars of brass that were in the house of the lord and the bases and the brasen sea that was in the house of the lord did the chaldees break in pieces and carried the brass of them to babylon
2ki2514 and the pots and the shovels and the snuffers and the spoons and all the vessels of brass wherewith they ministered took they away
2ki2515 and the firepans and the bowls and such things as were of gold in gold and of silver in silver the captain of the guard took away
2ki2516 the two pillars one sea and the bases which solomon had made for the house of the lord the brass of all these vessels was without weight
2ki2517 the height of the one pillar was eighteen cubits and the chapiter upon it was brass and the height of the chapiter three cubits and the wreathen work and pomegranates upon the chapiter round about all of brass and like unto these had the second pillar with wreathen work
2ki2518 and the captain of the guard took seraiah the chief priest and zephaniah the second priest and the three keepers of the door
2ki2519 and out of the city he took an officer that was set over the men of war and five men of them that were in the king's presence which were found in the city and the principal scribe of the host which mustered the people of the land and threescore men of the people of the land that were found in the city
2ki2520 and nebuzaradan captain of the guard took these and brought them to the king of babylon to riblah
2ki2521 and the king of babylon smote them and slew them at riblah in the land of hamath so judah was carried away out of their land
2ki2522 and as for the people that remained in the land of judah whom nebuchadnezzar king of babylon had left even over them he made gedaliah the son of ahikam the son of shaphan ruler
2ki2523 and when all the captains of the armies they and their men heard that the king of babylon had made gedaliah governor there came to gedaliah to mizpah even ishmael the son of nethaniah and johanan the son of careah and seraiah the son of tanhumeth the netophathite and jaazaniah the son of a maachathite they and their men
2ki2524 and gedaliah sware to them and to their men and said unto them fear not to be the servants of the chaldees dwell in the land and serve the king of babylon and it shall be well with you
2ki2525 but it came to pass in the seventh month that ishmael the son of nethaniah the son of elishama of the seed royal came and ten men with him and smote gedaliah that he died and the jews and the chaldees that were with him at mizpah
2ki2526 and all the people both small and great and the captains of the armies arose and came to egypt for they were afraid of the chaldees
2ki2527 and it came to pass in the seven and thirtieth year of the captivity of jehoiachin king of judah in the twelfth month on the seven and twentieth day of the month that evilmerodach king of babylon in the year that he began to reign did lift up the head of jehoiachin king of judah out of prison
2ki2528 and he spake kindly to him and set his throne above the throne of the kings that were with him in babylon
2ki2529 and changed his prison garments and he did eat bread continually before him all the days of his life
2ki2530 and his allowance was a continual allowance given him of the king a daily rate for every day all the days of his life
