and being open'd threw unwilling light
upon the wide wound that the boar had trench'd
in his soft flank whose wonted lily white
with purple tears that his wound wept was drench'd
no flower was nigh no grass herb leaf or weed
but stole his blood and seem'd with him to bleed
this solemn sympathy poor venus noteth
over one shoulder doth she hang her head
dumbly she passions franticly she doteth
she thinks he could not die he is not dead
her voice is stopt her joints forget to bow
her eyes are mad that they have wept til now
upon his hurt she looks so steadfastly
that her sight dazzling makes the wound seem three
and then she reprehends her mangling eye
that makes more gashes where no breach should be
his face seems twain each several limb is doubled
for oft the eye mistakes the brain being troubled
'my tongue cannot express my grief for one
and yet quoth she behold two adons dead
my sighs are blown away my salt tears gone
mine eyes are turn'd to fire my heart to lead
heavy heart's lead melt at mine eyes red fire
so shall i die by drops of hot desire
'alas poor world what treasure hast thou lost
what face remains alive that's worth the viewing
whose tongue is music now what canst thou boast
of things long since or any thing ensuing
the flowers are sweet their colours fresh and trim
but truesweet beauty lived and died with him
'bonnet nor veil henceforth no creature wear
nor sun nor wind will ever strive to kiss you
having no fair to lose you need not fear
the sun doth scorn you and the wind doth hiss you
but when adonis lived sun and sharp air
lurk'd like two thieves to rob him of his fair
'and therefore would he put his bonnet on
under whose brim the gaudy sun would peep
the wind would blow it off and being gone
play with his locks then would adonis weep
and straight in pity of his tender years
they both would strive who first should dry his tears
'to see his face the lion walk'd along
behind some hedge because he would not fear him
to recreate himself when he hath sung
the tiger would be tame and gently hear him
if he had spoke the wolf would leave his prey
and never fright the silly lamb that day
'when he beheld his shadow in the brook
the fishes spread on it their golden gills
when he was by the birds such pleasure took
that some would sing some other in their bills
would bring him mulberries and ripered cherries
he fed them with his sight they him with berries
'but this foul grim and urchinsnouted boar
whose downward eye still looketh for a grave
ne'er saw the beauteous livery that he wore
witness the entertainment that he gave
if he did see his face why then i know
he thought to kiss him and hath kill'd him so
''tis true tis true thus was adonis slain
he ran upon the boar with his sharp spear
who did not whet his teeth at him again
but by a kiss thought to persuade him there
and nuzzling in his flank the loving swine
sheathed unaware the tusk in his soft groin
'had i been tooth'd like him i must confess
with kissing him i should have kill'd him first
but he is dead and never did he bless
my youth with his the more am i accurst'
with this she falleth in the place she stood
and stains her face with his congealed blood
she looks upon his lips and they are pale
she takes him by the hand and that is cold
she whispers in his ears a heavy tale
as if they heard the woeful words she told
she lifts the cofferlids that close his eyes
where lo two lamps burnt out in darkness lies
two glasses where herself herself beheld
a thousand times and now no more reflect
their virtue lost wherein they late excell'd
and every beauty robb'd of his effect
'wonder of time quoth she this is my spite
that thou being dead the day should yet be light
'since thou art dead lo here i prophesy
sorrow on love hereafter shall attend
it shall be waited on with jealousy
find sweet beginning but unsavoury end
ne'er settled equally but high or low
that all love's pleasure shall not match his woe
'it shall be fickle false and full of fraud
bud and be blasted in a breathingwhile
the bottom poison and the top o'erstraw'd
with sweets that shall the truest sight beguile
the strongest body shall it make most weak
strike the wise dumb and teach the fool to speak
'it shall be sparing and too full of riot
teaching decrepit age to tread the measures
the staring ruffian shall it keep in quiet
pluck down the rich enrich the poor with treasures
it shall be ragingmad and sillymild
make the young old the old become a child
'it shall suspect where is no cause of fear
it shall not fear where it should most mistrust
it shall be merciful and too severe
and most deceiving when it seems most just
perverse it shall be where it shows most toward
put fear to valour courage to the coward
'it shall be cause of war and dire events
and set dissension twixt the son and sire
subject and servile to all discontents
as dry combustious matter is to fire
sith in his prime death doth my love destroy
they that love best their loves shall not enjoy'
by this the boy that by her side lay kill'd
was melted like a vapour from her sight
and in his blood that on the ground lay spill'd
a purple flower sprung up chequer'd with white
resembling well his pale cheeks and the blood
which in round drops upon their whiteness stood
she bows her head the newsprung flower to smell
comparing it to her adonis breath
and says within her bosom it shall dwell
since he himself is reft from her by death
she crops the stalk and in the breach appears
green dropping sap which she compares to tears
'poor flower quoth she this was thy fathers guise
sweet issue of a more sweetsmelling sire
for every little grief to wet his eyes
to grow unto himself was his desire
and so tis thine but know it is as good
to wither in my breast as in his blood
'here was thy father's bed here in my breast
thou art the next of blood and tis thy right
lo in this hollow cradle take thy rest
my throbbing heart shall rock thee day and night
there shall not be one minute in an hour
wherein i will not kiss my sweet love's flower'
thus weary of the world away she hies
and yokes her silver doves by whose swift aid
their mistress mounted through the empty skies
in her light chariot quickly is convey'd
holding their course to paphos where their queen
means to immure herself and not be seen
 all's well that ends well
