 burn that good pasture makes fat sheep and that a
 great cause of the night is lack of the sun that
 he that hath learned no wit by nature nor art may
 complain of good breeding or comes of a very dull kindred
touchstone such a one is a natural philosopher wast ever in
 court shepherd
corin no truly
touchstone then thou art damned
corin nay i hope
touchstone truly thou art damned like an illroasted egg all
 on one side
corin for not being at court your reason
touchstone why if thou never wast at court thou never sawest
 good manners if thou never sawest good manners
 then thy manners must be wicked and wickedness is
 sin and sin is damnation thou art in a parlous
 state shepherd
corin not a whit touchstone those that are good manners
 at the court are as ridiculous in the country as the
 behavior of the country is most mockable at the
 court you told me you salute not at the court but
 you kiss your hands that courtesy would be
 uncleanly if courtiers were shepherds
touchstone instance briefly come instance
corin why we are still handling our ewes and their
 fells you know are greasy
touchstone why do not your courtier's hands sweat and is not
 the grease of a mutton as wholesome as the sweat of
 a man shallow shallow a better instance i say come
corin besides our hands are hard
touchstone your lips will feel them the sooner shallow again
 a more sounder instance come
corin and they are often tarred over with the surgery of
 our sheep and would you have us kiss tar the
 courtier's hands are perfumed with civet
touchstone most shallow man thou wormsmeat in respect of a
 good piece of flesh indeed learn of the wise and
 perpend civet is of a baser birth than tar the
 very uncleanly flux of a cat mend the instance shepherd
corin you have too courtly a wit for me i'll rest
touchstone wilt thou rest damned god help thee shallow man
 god make incision in thee thou art raw
corin sir i am a true labourer i earn that i eat get
 that i wear owe no man hate envy no man's
 happiness glad of other men's good content with my
 harm and the greatest of my pride is to see my ewes
 graze and my lambs suck
touchstone that is another simple sin in you to bring the ewes
 and the rams together and to offer to get your
 living by the copulation of cattle to be bawd to a
 bellwether and to betray a shelamb of a
 twelvemonth to a crookedpated old cuckoldly ram
 out of all reasonable match if thou beest not
 damned for this the devil himself will have no
 shepherds i cannot see else how thou shouldst
 scape
corin here comes young master ganymede my new mistress's brother
 enter rosalind with a paper reading
rosalind from the east to western ind
 no jewel is like rosalind
 her worth being mounted on the wind
 through all the world bears rosalind
 all the pictures fairest lined
 are but black to rosalind
 let no fair be kept in mind
 but the fair of rosalind
touchstone i'll rhyme you so eight years together dinners and
 suppers and sleepinghours excepted it is the
 right butterwomen's rank to market
rosalind out fool
touchstone for a taste
 if a hart do lack a hind
 let him seek out rosalind
 if the cat will after kind
 so be sure will rosalind
 winter garments must be lined
 so must slender rosalind
 they that reap must sheaf and bind
 then to cart with rosalind
 sweetest nut hath sourest rind
 such a nut is rosalind
 he that sweetest rose will find
 must find love's prick and rosalind
 this is the very false gallop of verses why do you
 infect yourself with them
rosalind peace you dull fool i found them on a tree
touchstone truly the tree yields bad fruit
rosalind i'll graff it with you and then i shall graff it
 with a medlar then it will be the earliest fruit
 i the country for you'll be rotten ere you be half
 ripe and that's the right virtue of the medlar
touchstone you have said but whether wisely or no let the
 forest judge
 enter celia with a writing
rosalind peace here comes my sister reading stand aside
celia reads
 why should this a desert be
 for it is unpeopled no
 tongues i'll hang on every tree
 that shall civil sayings show
 some how brief the life of man
 runs his erring pilgrimage
 that the stretching of a span
 buckles in his sum of age
 some of violated vows
 twixt the souls of friend and friend
 but upon the fairest boughs
 or at every sentence end
 will i rosalinda write
 teaching all that read to know
 the quintessence of every sprite
 heaven would in little show
 therefore heaven nature charged
 that one body should be fill'd
 with all graces wideenlarged
 nature presently distill'd
 helen's cheek but not her heart
 cleopatra's majesty
 atalanta's better part
 sad lucretia's modesty
 thus rosalind of many parts
 by heavenly synod was devised
 of many faces eyes and hearts
 to have the touches dearest prized
 heaven would that she these gifts should have
 and i to live and die her slave
rosalind o most gentle pulpiter what tedious homily of love
 have you wearied your parishioners withal and never
 cried have patience good people'
celia how now back friends shepherd go off a little
 go with him sirrah
touchstone come shepherd let us make an honourable retreat
 though not with bag and baggage yet with scrip and scrippage
 exeunt corin and touchstone
celia didst thou hear these verses
rosalind o yes i heard them all and more too for some of
 them had in them more feet than the verses would bear
celia that's no matter the feet might bear the verses
rosalind ay but the feet were lame and could not bear
 themselves without the verse and therefore stood
 lamely in the verse
celia but didst thou hear without wondering how thy name
 should be hanged and carved upon these trees
rosalind i was seven of the nine days out of the wonder
 before you came for look here what i found on a
 palmtree i was never so berhymed since
 pythagoras time that i was an irish rat which i
 can hardly remember
celia trow you who hath done this
rosalind is it a man
celia and a chain that you once wore about his neck
 change you colour
rosalind i prithee who
celia o lord lord it is a hard matter for friends to
 meet but mountains may be removed with earthquakes
 and so encounter
rosalind nay but who is it
celia is it possible
rosalind nay i prithee now with most petitionary vehemence
 tell me who it is
celia o wonderful wonderful and most wonderful
 wonderful and yet again wonderful and after that
 out of all hooping
rosalind good my complexion dost thou think though i am
 caparisoned like a man i have a doublet and hose in
 my disposition one inch of delay more is a
 southsea of discovery i prithee tell me who is it
 quickly and speak apace i would thou couldst
 stammer that thou mightst pour this concealed man
 out of thy mouth as wine comes out of a narrow
 mouthed bottle either too much at once or none at
 all i prithee take the cork out of thy mouth that
 may drink thy tidings
celia so you may put a man in your belly
rosalind is he of god's making what manner of man is his
 head worth a hat or his chin worth a beard
celia nay he hath but a little beard
rosalind why god will send more if the man will be
 thankful let me stay the growth of his beard if
 thou delay me not the knowledge of his chin
celia it is young orlando that tripped up the wrestler's
 heels and your heart both in an instant
rosalind nay but the devil take mocking speak sad brow and
 true maid
celia i faith coz tis he
rosalind orlando
celia orlando
rosalind alas the day what shall i do with my doublet and
 hose what did he when thou sawest him what said
 he how looked he wherein went he what makes
 him here did he ask for me where remains he
 how parted he with thee and when shalt thou see
 him again answer me in one word
celia you must borrow me gargantua's mouth first tis a
 word too great for any mouth of this age's size to
 say ay and no to these particulars is more than to
 answer in a catechism
rosalind but doth he know that i am in this forest and in
 man's apparel looks he as freshly as he did the
 day he wrestled
