reynaldo very good my lord
lord polonius and then sir does he thishe doeswhat was i
 about to say by the mass i was about to say
 something where did i leave
reynaldo at closes in the consequence at friend or so'
 and gentleman'
lord polonius at closes in the consequence ay marry
 he closes thus i know the gentleman
 i saw him yesterday or t other day
 or then or then with such or such and as you say
 there was a gaming there o'ertook in's rouse
 there falling out at tennis or perchance
 i saw him enter such a house of sale'
 videlicet a brothel or so forth
 see you now
 your bait of falsehood takes this carp of truth
 and thus do we of wisdom and of reach
 with windlasses and with assays of bias
 by indirections find directions out
 so by my former lecture and advice
 shall you my son you have me have you not
reynaldo my lord i have
lord polonius god be wi you fare you well
reynaldo good my lord
lord polonius observe his inclination in yourself
reynaldo i shall my lord
lord polonius and let him ply his music
reynaldo well my lord
lord polonius farewell
 exit reynaldo
 enter ophelia
 how now ophelia what's the matter
ophelia o my lord my lord i have been so affrighted
lord polonius with what i the name of god
ophelia my lord as i was sewing in my closet
 lord hamlet with his doublet all unbraced
 no hat upon his head his stockings foul'd
 ungarter'd and downgyved to his ancle
 pale as his shirt his knees knocking each other
 and with a look so piteous in purport
 as if he had been loosed out of hell
 to speak of horrorshe comes before me
lord polonius mad for thy love
ophelia my lord i do not know
 but truly i do fear it
lord polonius what said he
ophelia he took me by the wrist and held me hard
 then goes he to the length of all his arm
 and with his other hand thus o'er his brow
 he falls to such perusal of my face
 as he would draw it long stay'd he so
 at last a little shaking of mine arm
 and thrice his head thus waving up and down
 he raised a sigh so piteous and profound
 as it did seem to shatter all his bulk
 and end his being that done he lets me go
 and with his head over his shoulder turn'd
 he seem'd to find his way without his eyes
 for out o doors he went without their helps
 and to the last bended their light on me
lord polonius come go with me i will go seek the king
 this is the very ecstasy of love
 whose violent property fordoes itself
 and leads the will to desperate undertakings
 as oft as any passion under heaven
 that does afflict our natures i am sorry
 what have you given him any hard words of late
ophelia no my good lord but as you did command
 i did repel his fetters and denied
 his access to me
lord polonius that hath made him mad
 i am sorry that with better heed and judgment
 i had not quoted him i fear'd he did but trifle
 and meant to wreck thee but beshrew my jealousy
 by heaven it is as proper to our age
 to cast beyond ourselves in our opinions
 as it is common for the younger sort
 to lack discretion come go we to the king
 this must be known which being kept close might
 move
 more grief to hide than hate to utter love

 hamlet
act ii
scene ii a room in the castle
 enter king claudius queen gertrude rosencrantz
 guildenstern and attendants
king claudius welcome dear rosencrantz and guildenstern
 moreover that we much did long to see you
 the need we have to use you did provoke
 our hasty sending something have you heard
 of hamlet's transformation so call it
 sith nor the exterior nor the inward man
 resembles that it was what it should be
 more than his father's death that thus hath put him
 so much from the understanding of himself
 i cannot dream of i entreat you both
 that being of so young days brought up with him
 and sith so neighbour'd to his youth and havior
 that you vouchsafe your rest here in our court
 some little time so by your companies
 to draw him on to pleasures and to gather
 so much as from occasion you may glean
 whether aught to us unknown afflicts him thus
 that open'd lies within our remedy
queen gertrude good gentlemen he hath much talk'd of you
 and sure i am two men there are not living
 to whom he more adheres if it will please you
 to show us so much gentry and good will
 as to expend your time with us awhile
 for the supply and profit of our hope
 your visitation shall receive such thanks
 as fits a king's remembrance
rosencrantz both your majesties
 might by the sovereign power you have of us
 put your dread pleasures more into command
 than to entreaty
guildenstern but we both obey
 and here give up ourselves in the full bent
 to lay our service freely at your feet
 to be commanded
king claudius thanks rosencrantz and gentle guildenstern
queen gertrude thanks guildenstern and gentle rosencrantz
 and i beseech you instantly to visit
 my too much changed son go some of you
 and bring these gentlemen where hamlet is
guildenstern heavens make our presence and our practises
 pleasant and helpful to him
queen gertrude ay amen
 exeunt rosencrantz guildenstern and some
 attendants
 enter polonius
lord polonius the ambassadors from norway my good lord
 are joyfully return'd
king claudius thou still hast been the father of good news
lord polonius have i my lord i assure my good liege
 i hold my duty as i hold my soul
 both to my god and to my gracious king
 and i do think or else this brain of mine
 hunts not the trail of policy so sure
 as it hath used to do that i have found
 the very cause of hamlet's lunacy
king claudius o speak of that that do i long to hear
lord polonius give first admittance to the ambassadors
 my news shall be the fruit to that great feast
king claudius thyself do grace to them and bring them in
 exit polonius
 he tells me my dear gertrude he hath found
 the head and source of all your son's distemper
queen gertrude i doubt it is no other but the main
 his father's death and our o'erhasty marriage
king claudius well we shall sift him
 reenter polonius with voltimand and cornelius
 welcome my good friends
 say voltimand what from our brother norway
voltimand most fair return of greetings and desires
 upon our first he sent out to suppress
 his nephew's levies which to him appear'd
 to be a preparation gainst the polack
 but better look'd into he truly found
 it was against your highness whereat grieved
 that so his sickness age and impotence
 was falsely borne in hand sends out arrests
 on fortinbras which he in brief obeys
 receives rebuke from norway and in fine
 makes vow before his uncle never more
 to give the assay of arms against your majesty
 whereon old norway overcome with joy
 gives him three thousand crowns in annual fee
 and his commission to employ those soldiers
 so levied as before against the polack
 with an entreaty herein further shown
 giving a paper
 that it might please you to give quiet pass
 through your dominions for this enterprise
 on such regards of safety and allowance
 as therein are set down
king claudius it likes us well
 and at our more consider'd time well read
 answer and think upon this business
 meantime we thank you for your welltook labour
 go to your rest at night we'll feast together
 most welcome home
 exeunt voltimand and cornelius
lord polonius this business is well ended
 my liege and madam to expostulate
 what majesty should be what duty is
 why day is day night night and time is time
 were nothing but to waste night day and time
 therefore since brevity is the soul of wit
 and tediousness the limbs and outward flourishes
 i will be brief your noble son is mad
 mad call i it for to define true madness
 what is't but to be nothing else but mad
 but let that go
queen gertrude more matter with less art
lord polonius madam i swear i use no art at all
 that he is mad tis true tis true tis pity
 and pity tis tis true a foolish figure
