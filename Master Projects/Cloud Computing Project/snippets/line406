imogen a father cruel and a stepdame false
 a foolish suitor to a wedded lady
 that hath her husband banish'do that husband
 my supreme crown of grief and those repeated
 vexations of it had i been thiefstol'n
 as my two brothers happy but most miserable
 is the desire that's glorious blest be those
 how mean soe'er that have their honest wills
 which seasons comfort who may this be fie
 enter pisanio and iachimo
pisanio madam a noble gentleman of rome
 comes from my lord with letters
iachimo change you madam
 the worthy leonatus is in safety
 and greets your highness dearly
 presents a letter
imogen thanks good sir
 you're kindly welcome
iachimo aside all of her that is out of door most rich
 if she be furnish'd with a mind so rare
 she is alone the arabian bird and i
 have lost the wager boldness be my friend
 arm me audacity from head to foot
 or like the parthian i shall flying fight
 rather directly fly
imogen reads he is one of the noblest note to whose
 kindnesses i am most infinitely tied reflect upon
 him accordingly as you value your trust
 leonatus'
 so far i read aloud
 but even the very middle of my heart
 is warm'd by the rest and takes it thankfully
 you are as welcome worthy sir as i
 have words to bid you and shall find it so
 in all that i can do
iachimo thanks fairest lady
 what are men mad hath nature given them eyes
 to see this vaulted arch and the rich crop
 of sea and land which can distinguish twixt
 the fiery orbs above and the twinn'd stones
 upon the number'd beach and can we not
 partition make with spectacles so precious
 twixt fair and foul
imogen what makes your admiration
iachimo it cannot be i the eye for apes and monkeys
 twixt two such shes would chatter this way and
 contemn with mows the other nor i the judgment
 for idiots in this case of favour would
 be wisely definite nor i the appetite
 sluttery to such neat excellence opposed
 should make desire vomit emptiness
 not so allured to feed
imogen what is the matter trow
iachimo the cloyed will
 that satiate yet unsatisfied desire that tub
 both fill'd and running ravening first the lamb
 longs after for the garbage
imogen what dear sir
 thus raps you are you well
iachimo thanks madam well
 to pisanio
 beseech you sir desire
 my man's abode where i did leave him he
 is strange and peevish
pisanio i was going sir
 to give him welcome
 exit
imogen continues well my lord his health beseech you
iachimo well madam
imogen is he disposed to mirth i hope he is
iachimo exceeding pleasant none a stranger there
 so merry and so gamesome he is call'd
 the briton reveller
imogen when he was here
 he did incline to sadness and ofttimes
 not knowing why
iachimo i never saw him sad
 there is a frenchman his companion one
 an eminent monsieur that it seems much loves
 a gallian girl at home he furnaces
 the thick sighs from him whiles the jolly briton
 your lord i meanlaughs from's free lungs cries o
 can my sides hold to think that man who knows
 by history report or his own proof
 what woman is yea what she cannot choose
 but must be will his free hours languish for
 assured bondage'
imogen will my lord say so
iachimo ay madam with his eyes in flood with laughter
 it is a recreation to be by
 and hear him mock the frenchman but heavens know
 some men are much to blame
imogen not he i hope
iachimo not he but yet heaven's bounty towards him might
 be used more thankfully in himself tis much
 in you which i account his beyond all talents
 whilst i am bound to wonder i am bound
 to pity too
imogen what do you pity sir
iachimo two creatures heartily
imogen am i one sir
 you look on me what wreck discern you in me
 deserves your pity
iachimo lamentable what
 to hide me from the radiant sun and solace
 i the dungeon by a snuff
imogen i pray you sir
 deliver with more openness your answers
 to my demands why do you pity me
iachimo that others do
 i was about to sayenjoy yourbut
 it is an office of the gods to venge it
 not mine to speak on t
imogen you do seem to know
 something of me or what concerns me pray you
 since doubling things go ill often hurts more
 than to be sure they do for certainties
 either are past remedies or timely knowing
 the remedy then borndiscover to me
 what both you spur and stop
iachimo had i this cheek
 to bathe my lips upon this hand whose touch
 whose every touch would force the feeler's soul
 to the oath of loyalty this object which
 takes prisoner the wild motion of mine eye
 fixing it only here should i damn'd then
 slaver with lips as common as the stairs
 that mount the capitol join gripes with hands
 made hard with hourly falsehoodfalsehood as
 with labour then bypeeping in an eye
 base and unlustrous as the smoky light
 that's fed with stinking tallow it were fit
 that all the plagues of hell should at one time
 encounter such revolt
imogen my lord i fear
 has forgot britain
iachimo and himself not i
 inclined to this intelligence pronounce
 the beggary of his change but tis your graces
 that from pay mutest conscience to my tongue
 charms this report out
imogen let me hear no more
iachimo o dearest soul your cause doth strike my heart
 with pity that doth make me sick a lady
 so fair and fasten'd to an empery
 would make the great'st king doubleto be partner'd
 with tomboys hired with that selfexhibition
 which your own coffers yield with diseased ventures
 that play with all infirmities for gold
 which rottenness can lend nature such boil'd stuff
 as well might poison poison be revenged
 or she that bore you was no queen and you
 recoil from your great stock
imogen revenged
 how should i be revenged if this be true
 as i have such a heart that both mine ears
 must not in haste abuseif it be true
 how should i be revenged
iachimo should he make me
 live like diana's priest betwixt cold sheets
 whiles he is vaulting variable ramps
 in your despite upon your purse revenge it
 i dedicate myself to your sweet pleasure
 more noble than that runagate to your bed
 and will continue fast to your affection
 still close as sure
imogen what ho pisanio
iachimo let me my service tender on your lips
imogen away i do condemn mine ears that have
 so long attended thee if thou wert honourable
 thou wouldst have told this tale for virtue not
 for such an end thou seek'stas base as strange
 thou wrong'st a gentleman who is as far
 from thy report as thou from honour and
 solicit'st here a lady that disdains
 thee and the devil alike what ho pisanio
 the king my father shall be made acquainted
 of thy assault if he shall think it fit
 a saucy stranger in his court to mart
 as in a romish stew and to expound
 his beastly mind to us he hath a court
 he little cares for and a daughter who
 he not respects at all what ho pisanio
iachimo o happy leonatus i may say
 the credit that thy lady hath of thee
 deserves thy trust and thy most perfect goodness
 her assured credit blessed live you long
 a lady to the worthiest sir that ever
 country call'd his and you his mistress only
 for the most worthiest fit give me your pardon
 i have spoke this to know if your affiance
 were deeply rooted and shall make your lord
 that which he is new o'er and he is one
 the truest manner'd such a holy witch
 that he enchants societies into him
 half all men's hearts are his
imogen you make amends
iachimo he sits mongst men like a descended god
 he hath a kind of honour sets him off
 more than a mortal seeming be not angry
