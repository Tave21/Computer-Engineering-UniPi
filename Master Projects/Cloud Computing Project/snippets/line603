 then death death
clown alack poor soul thou hast need of more rags to lay
 on thee rather than have these off

 than the stripes i have received which are mighty
 ones and millions

 great matter

 prince i cannot tell good sir for which of his
 virtues it was but he was certainly whipped out of the court

 out of the court they cherish it to make it stay
 there and yet it will no more but abide
autolycus vices i would say sir i know this man well he
 hath been since an apebearer then a
 processserver a bailiff then he compassed a
 motion of the prodigal son and married a tinker's
 wife within a mile where my land and living lies

 settled only in rogue some call him autolycus

 wakes fairs and bearbaitings

 put me into this apparel

 exit
 the winter's tale
act iv
scene iv the shepherd's cottage
 enter florizel and perdita
florizel these your unusual weeds to each part of you
 do give a life no shepherdess but flora
 peering in april's front this your sheepshearing
 is as a meeting of the petty gods
 and you the queen on't
perdita sir my gracious lord
 to chide at your extremes it not becomes me
 o pardon that i name them your high self
 the gracious mark o the land you have obscured
 with a swain's wearing and me poor lowly maid
 most goddesslike prank'd up but that our feasts
 in every mess have folly and the feeders
 digest it with a custom i should blush
 to see you so attired sworn i think
 to show myself a glass
florizel i bless the time
 when my good falcon made her flight across
 thy father's ground
perdita now jove afford you cause
 to me the difference forges dread your greatness
 hath not been used to fear even now i tremble
 to think your father by some accident
 should pass this way as you did o the fates
 how would he look to see his work so noble
 vilely bound up what would he say or how
 should i in these my borrow'd flaunts behold
 the sternness of his presence
florizel apprehend
 nothing but jollity the gods themselves
 humbling their deities to love have taken
 the shapes of beasts upon them jupiter
 became a bull and bellow'd the green neptune
 a ram and bleated and the firerobed god
 golden apollo a poor humble swain
 as i seem now their transformations
 were never for a piece of beauty rarer
 nor in a way so chaste since my desires
 run not before mine honour nor my lusts
 burn hotter than my faith
perdita o but sir
 your resolution cannot hold when tis
 opposed as it must be by the power of the king
 one of these two must be necessities
 which then will speak that you must
 change this purpose
 or i my life
florizel thou dearest perdita
 with these forced thoughts i prithee darken not
 the mirth o the feast or i'll be thine my fair
 or not my father's for i cannot be
 mine own nor any thing to any if
 i be not thine to this i am most constant
 though destiny say no be merry gentle
 strangle such thoughts as these with any thing
 that you behold the while your guests are coming
 lift up your countenance as it were the day
 of celebration of that nuptial which
 we two have sworn shall come
perdita o lady fortune
 stand you auspicious
florizel see your guests approach
 address yourself to entertain them sprightly
 and let's be red with mirth
 enter shepherd clown mopsa dorcas and
 others with polixenes and camillo disguised
shepherd fie daughter when my old wife lived upon
 this day she was both pantler butler cook
 both dame and servant welcomed all served all
 would sing her song and dance her turn now here
 at upper end o the table now i the middle
 on his shoulder and his her face o fire
 with labour and the thing she took to quench it
 she would to each one sip you are retired
 as if you were a feasted one and not
 the hostess of the meeting pray you bid
 these unknown friends to's welcome for it is
 a way to make us better friends more known
 come quench your blushes and present yourself
 that which you are mistress o the feast come on
 and bid us welcome to your sheepshearing
 as your good flock shall prosper
perdita to polixenes sir welcome
 it is my father's will i should take on me
 the hostessship o the day
 to camillo
 you're welcome sir
 give me those flowers there dorcas reverend sirs
 for you there's rosemary and rue these keep
 seeming and savour all the winter long
 grace and remembrance be to you both
 and welcome to our shearing
polixenes shepherdess
 a fair one are youwell you fit our ages
 with flowers of winter
perdita sir the year growing ancient
 not yet on summer's death nor on the birth
 of trembling winter the fairest
 flowers o the season
 are our carnations and streak'd gillyvors
 which some call nature's bastards of that kind
 our rustic garden's barren and i care not
 to get slips of them
polixenes wherefore gentle maiden
 do you neglect them
perdita for i have heard it said
 there is an art which in their piedness shares
 with great creating nature
polixenes say there be
 yet nature is made better by no mean
 but nature makes that mean so over that art
 which you say adds to nature is an art
 that nature makes you see sweet maid we marry
 a gentler scion to the wildest stock
 and make conceive a bark of baser kind
 by bud of nobler race this is an art
