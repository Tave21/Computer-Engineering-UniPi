 disdain to root the summerswelling flower
 and make rough winter everlastingly
proteus why valentine what braggardism is this
valentine pardon me proteus all i can is nothing
 to her whose worth makes other worthies nothing
 she is alone
proteus then let her alone
valentine not for the world why man she is mine own
 and i as rich in having such a jewel
 as twenty seas if all their sand were pearl
 the water nectar and the rocks pure gold
 forgive me that i do not dream on thee
 because thou see'st me dote upon my love
 my foolish rival that her father likes
 only for his possessions are so huge
 is gone with her along and i must after
 for love thou know'st is full of jealousy
proteus but she loves you
valentine ay and we are betroth'd nay more our
 marriagehour
 with all the cunning manner of our flight
 determined of how i must climb her window
 the ladder made of cords and all the means
 plotted and greed on for my happiness
 good proteus go with me to my chamber
 in these affairs to aid me with thy counsel
proteus go on before i shall inquire you forth
 i must unto the road to disembark
 some necessaries that i needs must use
 and then i'll presently attend you
valentine will you make haste
proteus i will
 exit valentine
 even as one heat another heat expels
 or as one nail by strength drives out another
 so the remembrance of my former love
 is by a newer object quite forgotten
 is it mine or valentine's praise
 her true perfection or my false transgression
 that makes me reasonless to reason thus
 she is fair and so is julia that i love
 that i did love for now my love is thaw'd
 which like a waxen image gainst a fire
 bears no impression of the thing it was
 methinks my zeal to valentine is cold
 and that i love him not as i was wont
 o but i love his lady too too much
 and that's the reason i love him so little
 how shall i dote on her with more advice
 that thus without advice begin to love her
 tis but her picture i have yet beheld
 and that hath dazzled my reason's light
 but when i look on her perfections
 there is no reason but i shall be blind
 if i can cheque my erring love i will
 if not to compass her i'll use my skill

scene v the same a street
 enter speed and launce severally
speed launce by mine honesty welcome to milan
launce forswear not thyself sweet youth for i am not
 welcome i reckon this always that a man is never
 undone till he be hanged nor never welcome to a
 place till some certain shot be paid and the hostess
 say welcome'
speed come on you madcap i'll to the alehouse with you
 presently where for one shot of five pence thou
 shalt have five thousand welcomes but sirrah how
 did thy master part with madam julia
launce marry after they closed in earnest they parted very
 fairly in jest
speed but shall she marry him
launce no
speed how then shall he marry her
launce no neither
speed what are they broken
launce no they are both as whole as a fish
speed why then how stands the matter with them
launce marry thus when it stands well with him it
 stands well with her
speed what an ass art thou i understand thee not
launce what a block art thou that thou canst not my
 staff understands me
speed what thou sayest
launce ay and what i do too look thee i'll but lean
 and my staff understands me
speed it stands under thee indeed
launce why standunder and understand is all one
speed but tell me true will't be a match
launce ask my dog if he say ay it will if he say no
 it will if he shake his tail and say nothing it will
speed the conclusion is then that it will
launce thou shalt never get such a secret from me but by a parable
speed tis well that i get it so but launce how sayest
 thou that my master is become a notable lover
launce i never knew him otherwise
speed than how
launce a notable lubber as thou reportest him to be
speed why thou whoreson ass thou mistakest me
launce why fool i meant not thee i meant thy master
speed i tell thee my master is become a hot lover
launce why i tell thee i care not though he burn himself
 in love if thou wilt go with me to the alehouse
 if not thou art an hebrew a jew and not worth the
 name of a christian
speed why
launce because thou hast not so much charity in thee as to
 go to the ale with a christian wilt thou go
speed at thy service

act ii
scene vi the same the duke's palace
 enter proteus
proteus to leave my julia shall i be forsworn
 to love fair silvia shall i be forsworn
 to wrong my friend i shall be much forsworn
 and even that power which gave me first my oath
 provokes me to this threefold perjury
 love bade me swear and love bids me forswear
 o sweetsuggesting love if thou hast sinned
 teach me thy tempted subject to excuse it
 at first i did adore a twinkling star
 but now i worship a celestial sun
 unheedful vows may heedfully be broken
 and he wants wit that wants resolved will
 to learn his wit to exchange the bad for better
 fie fie unreverend tongue to call her bad
 whose sovereignty so oft thou hast preferr'd
 with twenty thousand soulconfirming oaths
 i cannot leave to love and yet i do
 but there i leave to love where i should love
 julia i lose and valentine i lose
 if i keep them i needs must lose myself
 if i lose them thus find i by their loss
 for valentine myself for julia silvia
 i to myself am dearer than a friend
 for love is still most precious in itself
 and silviawitness heaven that made her fair
 shows julia but a swarthy ethiope
 i will forget that julia is alive
 remembering that my love to her is dead
 and valentine i'll hold an enemy
 aiming at silvia as a sweeter friend
 i cannot now prove constant to myself
 without some treachery used to valentine
 this night he meaneth with a corded ladder
 to climb celestial silvia's chamberwindow
 myself in counsel his competitor
 now presently i'll give her father notice
 of their disguising and pretended flight
 who all enraged will banish valentine
 for thurio he intends shall wed his daughter
 but valentine being gone i'll quickly cross
 by some sly trick blunt thurio's dull proceeding
 love lend me wings to make my purpose swift
 as thou hast lent me wit to plot this drift

scene vii verona julia's house
 enter julia and lucetta
julia counsel lucetta gentle girl assist me
 and even in kind love i do conjure thee
 who art the table wherein all my thoughts
 are visibly character'd and engraved
 to lesson me and tell me some good mean
 how with my honour i may undertake
 a journey to my loving proteus
lucetta alas the way is wearisome and long
julia a truedevoted pilgrim is not weary
 to measure kingdoms with his feeble steps
 much less shall she that hath love's wings to fly
 and when the flight is made to one so dear
 of such divine perfection as sir proteus
lucetta better forbear till proteus make return
julia o know'st thou not his looks are my soul's food
 pity the dearth that i have pined in
 by longing for that food so long a time
 didst thou but know the inly touch of love
 thou wouldst as soon go kindle fire with snow
 as seek to quench the fire of love with words
lucetta i do not seek to quench your love's hot fire
 but qualify the fire's extreme rage
 lest it should burn above the bounds of reason
julia the more thou damm'st it up the more it burns
 the current that with gentle murmur glides
 thou know'st being stopp'd impatiently doth rage
 but when his fair course is not hindered
 he makes sweet music with the enamell'ed stones
 giving a gentle kiss to every sedge
 he overtaketh in his pilgrimage
 and so by many winding nooks he strays
 with willing sport to the wild ocean
 then let me go and hinder not my course
 i'll be as patient as a gentle stream
 and make a pastime of each weary step
 till the last step have brought me to my love
