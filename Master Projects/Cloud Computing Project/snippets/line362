 his great right to be so gerard de narbon
lafeu he was excellent indeed madam the king very
 lately spoke of him admiringly and mourningly he
 was skilful enough to have lived still if knowledge
 could be set up against mortality
bertram what is it my good lord the king languishes of
lafeu a fistula my lord
bertram i heard not of it before
lafeu i would it were not notorious was this gentlewoman
 the daughter of gerard de narbon
countess his sole child my lord and bequeathed to my
 overlooking i have those hopes of her good that
 her education promises her dispositions she
 inherits which makes fair gifts fairer for where
 an unclean mind carries virtuous qualities there
 commendations go with pity they are virtues and
 traitors too in her they are the better for their
 simpleness she derives her honesty and achieves her goodness
lafeu your commendations madam get from her tears
countess tis the best brine a maiden can season her praise
 in the remembrance of her father never approaches
 her heart but the tyranny of her sorrows takes all
 livelihood from her cheek no more of this helena
 go to no more lest it be rather thought you affect
 a sorrow than have it
helena i do affect a sorrow indeed but i have it too
lafeu moderate lamentation is the right of the dead
 excessive grief the enemy to the living
countess if the living be enemy to the grief the excess
 makes it soon mortal
bertram madam i desire your holy wishes
lafeu how understand we that
countess be thou blest bertram and succeed thy father
 in manners as in shape thy blood and virtue
 contend for empire in thee and thy goodness
 share with thy birthright love all trust a few
 do wrong to none be able for thine enemy
 rather in power than use and keep thy friend
 under thy own life's key be cheque'd for silence
 but never tax'd for speech what heaven more will
 that thee may furnish and my prayers pluck down
 fall on thy head farewell my lord
 tis an unseason'd courtier good my lord
 advise him
lafeu he cannot want the best
 that shall attend his love
countess heaven bless him farewell bertram
 exit
bertram to helena the best wishes that can be forged in
 your thoughts be servants to you be comfortable
 to my mother your mistress and make much of her
lafeu farewell pretty lady you must hold the credit of
 your father
 exeunt bertram and lafeu
helena o were that all i think not on my father
 and these great tears grace his remembrance more
 than those i shed for him what was he like
 i have forgot him my imagination
 carries no favour in't but bertram's
 i am undone there is no living none
 if bertram be away twere all one
 that i should love a bright particular star
 and think to wed it he is so above me
 in his bright radiance and collateral light
 must i be comforted not in his sphere
 the ambition in my love thus plagues itself
 the hind that would be mated by the lion
 must die for love twas pretty though plague
 to see him every hour to sit and draw
 his arched brows his hawking eye his curls
 in our heart's table heart too capable
 of every line and trick of his sweet favour
 but now he's gone and my idolatrous fancy
 must sanctify his reliques who comes here
 enter parolles
 aside
 one that goes with him i love him for his sake
 and yet i know him a notorious liar
 think him a great way fool solely a coward
 yet these fixed evils sit so fit in him
 that they take place when virtue's steely bones
 look bleak i the cold wind withal full oft we see
 cold wisdom waiting on superfluous folly
parolles save you fair queen
helena and you monarch
parolles no
helena and no
parolles are you meditating on virginity
helena ay you have some stain of soldier in you let me
 ask you a question man is enemy to virginity how
 may we barricado it against him
parolles keep him out
helena but he assails and our virginity though valiant
 in the defence yet is weak unfold to us some
 warlike resistance
parolles there is none man sitting down before you will
 undermine you and blow you up
helena bless our poor virginity from underminers and
 blowers up is there no military policy how
 virgins might blow up men
parolles virginity being blown down man will quicklier be
 blown up marry in blowing him down again with
 the breach yourselves made you lose your city it
 is not politic in the commonwealth of nature to
 preserve virginity loss of virginity is rational
 increase and there was never virgin got till
 virginity was first lost that you were made of is
 metal to make virgins virginity by being once lost
 may be ten times found by being ever kept it is
 ever lost tis too cold a companion away with t
helena i will stand for t a little though therefore i die a virgin
parolles there's little can be said in t tis against the
 rule of nature to speak on the part of virginity
 is to accuse your mothers which is most infallible
 disobedience he that hangs himself is a virgin
 virginity murders itself and should be buried in
 highways out of all sanctified limit as a desperate
 offendress against nature virginity breeds mites
 much like a cheese consumes itself to the very
 paring and so dies with feeding his own stomach
 besides virginity is peevish proud idle made of
 selflove which is the most inhibited sin in the
 canon keep it not you cannot choose but loose
 by't out with t within ten year it will make
 itself ten which is a goodly increase and the
 principal itself not much the worse away with t
helena how might one do sir to lose it to her own liking
parolles let me see marry ill to like him that ne'er it
 likes tis a commodity will lose the gloss with
 lying the longer kept the less worth off with t
 while tis vendible answer the time of request
 virginity like an old courtier wears her cap out
 of fashion richly suited but unsuitable just
 like the brooch and the toothpick which wear not
 now your date is better in your pie and your
 porridge than in your cheek and your virginity
 your old virginity is like one of our french
 withered pears it looks ill it eats drily marry
 tis a withered pear it was formerly better
 marry yet tis a withered pear will you anything with it
helena not my virginity yet 
 there shall your master have a thousand loves
 a mother and a mistress and a friend
 a phoenix captain and an enemy
 a guide a goddess and a sovereign
 a counsellor a traitress and a dear
 his humble ambition proud humility
 his jarring concord and his discord dulcet
 his faith his sweet disaster with a world
 of pretty fond adoptious christendoms
 that blinking cupid gossips now shall he
 i know not what he shall god send him well
 the court's a learning place and he is one
parolles what one i faith
helena that i wish well tis pity
parolles what's pity
helena that wishing well had not a body in't
 which might be felt that we the poorer born
 whose baser stars do shut us up in wishes
 might with effects of them follow our friends
 and show what we alone must think which never
 return us thanks
 enter page
page monsieur parolles my lord calls for you
 exit
parolles little helen farewell if i can remember thee i
 will think of thee at court
helena monsieur parolles you were born under a charitable star
parolles under mars i
helena i especially think under mars
parolles why under mars
helena the wars have so kept you under that you must needs
 be born under mars
parolles when he was predominant
helena when he was retrograde i think rather
parolles why think you so
helena you go so much backward when you fight
parolles that's for advantage
helena so is running away when fear proposes the safety
 but the composition that your valour and fear makes
 in you is a virtue of a good wing and i like the wear well
parolles i am so full of businesses i cannot answer thee
 acutely i will return perfect courtier in the
 which my instruction shall serve to naturalize
 thee so thou wilt be capable of a courtier's
 counsel and understand what advice shall thrust upon
 thee else thou diest in thine unthankfulness and
 thine ignorance makes thee away farewell when
 thou hast leisure say thy prayers when thou hast
 none remember thy friends get thee a good husband
 and use him as he uses thee so farewell
 exit
helena our remedies oft in ourselves do lie
 which we ascribe to heaven the fated sky
 gives us free scope only doth backward pull
 our slow designs when we ourselves are dull
 what power is it which mounts my love so high
 that makes me see and cannot feed mine eye
 the mightiest space in fortune nature brings
 to join like likes and kiss like native things
