 my knighthood and my soldiership aside i had lied
 in my throat if i had said so
servant i pray you sir then set your knighthood and our
 soldiership aside and give me leave to tell you
 you lie in your throat if you say i am any other
 than an honest man
falstaff i give thee leave to tell me so i lay aside that
 which grows to me if thou gettest any leave of me
 hang me if thou takest leave thou wert better be
 hanged you hunt counter hence avaunt
servant sir my lord would speak with you
lord chiefjustice sir john falstaff a word with you
falstaff my good lord god give your lordship good time of
 day i am glad to see your lordship abroad i heard
 say your lordship was sick i hope your lordship
 goes abroad by advice your lordship though not
 clean past your youth hath yet some smack of age in
 you some relish of the saltness of time and i must
 humbly beseech your lordship to have a reverent care
 of your health
lord chiefjustice sir john i sent for you before your expedition to
 shrewsbury
falstaff an't please your lordship i hear his majesty is
 returned with some discomfort from wales
lord chiefjustice i talk not of his majesty you would not come when
 i sent for you
falstaff and i hear moreover his highness is fallen into
 this same whoreson apoplexy
lord chiefjustice well god mend him i pray you let me speak with
 you
falstaff this apoplexy is as i take it a kind of lethargy
 an't please your lordship a kind of sleeping in the
 blood a whoreson tingling
lord chiefjustice what tell you me of it be it as it is
falstaff it hath its original from much grief from study and
 perturbation of the brain i have read the cause of
 his effects in galen it is a kind of deafness
lord chiefjustice i think you are fallen into the disease for you
 hear not what i say to you
falstaff very well my lord very well rather an't please
 you it is the disease of not listening the malady
 of not marking that i am troubled withal
lord chiefjustice to punish you by the heels would amend the
 attention of your ears and i care not if i do
 become your physician
falstaff i am as poor as job my lord but not so patient
 your lordship may minister the potion of
 imprisonment to me in respect of poverty but how
 should i be your patient to follow your
 prescriptions the wise may make some dram of a
 scruple or indeed a scruple itself
lord chiefjustice i sent for you when there were matters against you
 for your life to come speak with me
falstaff as i was then advised by my learned counsel in the
 laws of this landservice i did not come
lord chiefjustice well the truth is sir john you live in great infamy
falstaff he that buckles him in my belt cannot live in less
lord chiefjustice your means are very slender and your waste is great
falstaff i would it were otherwise i would my means were
 greater and my waist slenderer
lord chiefjustice you have misled the youthful prince
falstaff the young prince hath misled me i am the fellow
 with the great belly and he my dog
lord chiefjustice well i am loath to gall a newhealed wound your
 day's service at shrewsbury hath a little gilded
 over your night's exploit on gad'shill you may
 thank the unquiet time for your quiet o'erposting
 that action
falstaff my lord
lord chiefjustice but since all is well keep it so wake not a
 sleeping wolf
falstaff to wake a wolf is as bad as to smell a fox
lord chiefjustice what you are as a candle the better part burnt
 out
falstaff a wassail candle my lord all tallow if i did say
 of wax my growth would approve the truth
lord chiefjustice there is not a white hair on your face but should
 have his effect of gravity
falstaff his effect of gravy gravy gravy
lord chiefjustice you follow the young prince up and down like his
 ill angel
falstaff not so my lord your ill angel is light but i hope
 he that looks upon me will take me without weighing
 and yet in some respects i grant i cannot go i
 cannot tell virtue is of so little regard in these
 costermonger times that true valour is turned
 bearherd pregnancy is made a tapster and hath
 his quick wit wasted in giving reckonings all the
 other gifts appertinent to man as the malice of
 this age shapes them are not worth a gooseberry
 you that are old consider not the capacities of us
 that are young you do measure the heat of our
 livers with the bitterness of your galls and we
 that are in the vaward of our youth i must confess
 are wags too
lord chiefjustice do you set down your name in the scroll of youth
 that are written down old with all the characters of
 age have you not a moist eye a dry hand a
 yellow cheek a white beard a decreasing leg an
 increasing belly is not your voice broken your
 wind short your chin double your wit single and
 every part about you blasted with antiquity and
 will you yet call yourself young fie fie fie sir john
falstaff my lord i was born about three of the clock in the
 afternoon with a white head and something a round
 belly for my voice i have lost it with halloing
 and singing of anthems to approve my youth
 further i will not the truth is i am only old in
 judgment and understanding and he that will caper
 with me for a thousand marks let him lend me the
 money and have at him for the box of the ear that
 the prince gave you he gave it like a rude prince
 and you took it like a sensible lord i have
 chequed him for it and the young lion repents
 marry not in ashes and sackcloth but in new silk
 and old sack
lord chiefjustice well god send the prince a better companion
falstaff god send the companion a better prince i cannot
 rid my hands of him
lord chiefjustice well the king hath severed you and prince harry i
 hear you are going with lord john of lancaster
 against the archbishop and the earl of
 northumberland
falstaff yea i thank your pretty sweet wit for it but look
 you pray all you that kiss my lady peace at home
 that our armies join not in a hot day for by the
 lord i take but two shirts out with me and i mean
 not to sweat extraordinarily if it be a hot day
 and i brandish any thing but a bottle i would i
 might never spit white again there is not a
 dangerous action can peep out his head but i am
 thrust upon it well i cannot last ever but it
 was alway yet the trick of our english nation if
 they have a good thing to make it too common if
 ye will needs say i am an old man you should give
 me rest i would to god my name were not so
 terrible to the enemy as it is i were better to be
 eaten to death with a rust than to be scoured to
 nothing with perpetual motion
lord chiefjustice well be honest be honest and god bless your
 expedition
falstaff will your lordship lend me a thousand pound to
 furnish me forth
lord chiefjustice not a penny not a penny you are too impatient to
 bear crosses fare you well commend me to my
 cousin westmoreland
 exeunt chiefjustice and servant
falstaff if i do fillip me with a threeman beetle a man
 can no more separate age and covetousness than a'
 can part young limbs and lechery but the gout
 galls the one and the pox pinches the other and
 so both the degrees prevent my curses boy
page sir
falstaff what money is in my purse
page seven groats and two pence
falstaff i can get no remedy against this consumption of the
 purse borrowing only lingers and lingers it out
 but the disease is incurable go bear this letter
 to my lord of lancaster this to the prince this
 to the earl of westmoreland and this to old
 mistress ursula whom i have weekly sworn to marry
 since i perceived the first white hair on my chin
 about it you know where to find me
 exit page
 a pox of this gout or a gout of this pox for
 the one or the other plays the rogue with my great
 toe tis no matter if i do halt i have the wars
 for my colour and my pension shall seem the more
 reasonable a good wit will make use of any thing
 i will turn diseases to commodity

 2 king henry iv
act i
scene iii york the archbishop's palace
 enter the archbishop of york the lords hastings
 mowbray and bardolph
archbishop of york thus have you heard our cause and known our means
 and my most noble friends i pray you all
 speak plainly your opinions of our hopes
 and first lord marshal what say you to it
mowbray i well allow the occasion of our arms
 but gladly would be better satisfied
 how in our means we should advance ourselves
 to look with forehead bold and big enough
 upon the power and puissance of the king
hastings our present musters grow upon the file
 to five and twenty thousand men of choice
 and our supplies live largely in the hope
 of great northumberland whose bosom burns
 with an incensed fire of injuries
lord bardolph the question then lord hastings standeth thus
 whether our present five and twenty thousand
 may hold up head without northumberland
hastings with him we may
lord bardolph yea marry there's the point
 but if without him we be thought too feeble
 my judgment is we should not step too far
 till we had his assistance by the hand
 for in a theme so bloodyfaced as this
 conjecture expectation and surmise
