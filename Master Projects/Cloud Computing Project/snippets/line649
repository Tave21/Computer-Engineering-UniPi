act ii
scene iii warkworth before the castle
 enter northumberland lady northumberland and lady percy
northumberland i pray thee loving wife and gentle daughter
 give even way unto my rough affairs
 put not you on the visage of the times
 and be like them to percy troublesome
lady
northumberland i have given over i will speak no more
 do what you will your wisdom be your guide
northumberland alas sweet wife my honour is at pawn
 and but my going nothing can redeem it
lady percy o yet for god's sake go not to these wars
 the time was father that you broke your word
 when you were more endeared to it than now
 when your own percy when my heart's dear harry
 threw many a northward look to see his father
 bring up his powers but he did long in vain
 who then persuaded you to stay at home
 there were two honours lost yours and your son's
 for yours the god of heaven brighten it
 for his it stuck upon him as the sun
 in the grey vault of heaven and by his light
 did all the chivalry of england move
 to do brave acts he was indeed the glass
 wherein the noble youth did dress themselves
 he had no legs that practised not his gait
 and speaking thick which nature made his blemish
 became the accents of the valiant
 for those that could speak low and tardily
 would turn their own perfection to abuse
 to seem like him so that in speech in gait
 in diet in affections of delight
 in military rules humours of blood
 he was the mark and glass copy and book
 that fashion'd others and him o wondrous him
 o miracle of men him did you leave
 second to none unseconded by you
 to look upon the hideous god of war
 in disadvantage to abide a field
 where nothing but the sound of hotspur's name
 did seem defensible so you left him
 never o never do his ghost the wrong
 to hold your honour more precise and nice
 with others than with him let them alone
 the marshal and the archbishop are strong
 had my sweet harry had but half their numbers
 today might i hanging on hotspur's neck
 have talk'd of monmouth's grave
northumberland beshrew your heart
 fair daughter you do draw my spirits from me
 with new lamenting ancient oversights
 but i must go and meet with danger there
 or it will seek me in another place
 and find me worse provided
lady
northumberland o fly to scotland
 till that the nobles and the armed commons
 have of their puissance made a little taste
lady percy if they get ground and vantage of the king
 then join you with them like a rib of steel
 to make strength stronger but for all our loves
 first let them try themselves so did your son
 he was so suffer'd so came i a widow
 and never shall have length of life enough
 to rain upon remembrance with mine eyes
 that it may grow and sprout as high as heaven
 for recordation to my noble husband
northumberland come come go in with me tis with my mind
 as with the tide swell'd up unto his height
 that makes a stillstand running neither way
 fain would i go to meet the archbishop
 but many thousand reasons hold me back
 i will resolve for scotland there am i
 till time and vantage crave my company
