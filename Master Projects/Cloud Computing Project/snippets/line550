 exeunt
 troilus and cressida
act i
scene ii the same a street
 enter cressida and alexander
cressida who were those went by
alexander queen hecuba and helen
cressida and whither go they
alexander up to the eastern tower
 whose height commands as subject all the vale
 to see the battle hector whose patience
 is as a virtue fix'd today was moved
 he chid andromache and struck his armourer
 and like as there were husbandry in war
 before the sun rose he was harness'd light
 and to the field goes he where every flower
 did as a prophet weep what it foresaw
 in hector's wrath
cressida what was his cause of anger
alexander the noise goes this there is among the greeks
 a lord of trojan blood nephew to hector
 they call him ajax
cressida good and what of him
alexander they say he is a very man per se
 and stands alone
cressida so do all men unless they are drunk sick or have no legs
alexander this man lady hath robbed many beasts of their
 particular additions he is as valiant as the lion
 churlish as the bear slow as the elephant a man
 into whom nature hath so crowded humours that his
 valour is crushed into folly his folly sauced with
 discretion there is no man hath a virtue that he
 hath not a glimpse of nor any man an attaint but he
 carries some stain of it he is melancholy without
 cause and merry against the hair he hath the
 joints of every thing but everything so out of joint
 that he is a gouty briareus many hands and no use
 or purblind argus all eyes and no sight
cressida but how should this man that makes
 me smile make hector angry
alexander they say he yesterday coped hector in the battle and
 struck him down the disdain and shame whereof hath
 ever since kept hector fasting and waking
cressida who comes here
alexander madam your uncle pandarus
 enter pandarus
cressida hector's a gallant man
alexander as may be in the world lady
pandarus what's that what's that
cressida good morrow uncle pandarus
pandarus good morrow cousin cressid what do you talk of
 good morrow alexander how do you cousin when
 were you at ilium
cressida this morning uncle
pandarus what were you talking of when i came was hector
 armed and gone ere ye came to ilium helen was not
 up was she
cressida hector was gone but helen was not up
pandarus even so hector was stirring early
cressida that were we talking of and of his anger
pandarus was he angry
cressida so he says here
pandarus true he was so i know the cause too he'll lay
 about him today i can tell them that and there's
 troilus will not come far behind him let them take
 heed of troilus i can tell them that too
cressida what is he angry too
pandarus who troilus troilus is the better man of the two
cressida o jupiter there's no comparison
pandarus what not between troilus and hector do you know a
 man if you see him
cressida ay if i ever saw him before and knew him
pandarus well i say troilus is troilus
cressida then you say as i say for i am sure he is not hector
pandarus no nor hector is not troilus in some degrees
cressida tis just to each of them he is himself
pandarus himself alas poor troilus i would he were
cressida so he is
pandarus condition i had gone barefoot to india
cressida he is not hector
pandarus himself no he's not himself would a were
 himself well the gods are above time must friend
 or end well troilus well i would my heart were
 in her body no hector is not a better man than troilus
cressida excuse me
pandarus he is elder
cressida pardon me pardon me
pandarus th other's not come to't you shall tell me another
 tale when th other's come to't hector shall not
 have his wit this year
cressida he shall not need it if he have his own
pandarus nor his qualities
cressida no matter
pandarus nor his beauty
cressida twould not become him his own's better
pandarus you have no judgment niece helen
 herself swore th other day that troilus for
 a brown favourfor so tis i must confess
 not brown neither
cressida no but brown
pandarus faith to say truth brown and not brown
cressida to say the truth true and not true
pandarus she praised his complexion above paris
cressida why paris hath colour enough
pandarus so he has
cressida then troilus should have too much if she praised
 him above his complexion is higher than his he
 having colour enough and the other higher is too
 flaming a praise for a good complexion i had as
 lief helen's golden tongue had commended troilus for
 a copper nose
pandarus i swear to you i think helen loves him better than paris
cressida then she's a merry greek indeed
pandarus nay i am sure she does she came to him th other
 day into the compassed windowand you know he
 has not past three or four hairs on his chin
cressida indeed a tapster's arithmetic may soon bring his
 particulars therein to a total
pandarus why he is very young and yet will he within
 three pound lift as much as his brother hector
cressida is he so young a man and so old a lifter
pandarus but to prove to you that helen loves him she came
 and puts me her white hand to his cloven chin
cressida juno have mercy how came it cloven
pandarus why you know tis dimpled i think his smiling
 becomes him better than any man in all phrygia
cressida o he smiles valiantly
pandarus does he not
cressida o yes an twere a cloud in autumn
pandarus why go to then but to prove to you that helen
 loves troilus
cressida troilus will stand to the proof if you'll
 prove it so
pandarus troilus why he esteems her no more than i esteem
 an addle egg
cressida if you love an addle egg as well as you love an idle
 head you would eat chickens i the shell
pandarus i cannot choose but laugh to think how she tickled
 his chin indeed she has a marvellous white hand i
 must needs confess
cressida without the rack
pandarus and she takes upon her to spy a white hair on his chin
cressida alas poor chin many a wart is richer
pandarus but there was such laughing queen hecuba laughed
 that her eyes ran o'er
cressida with millstones
pandarus and cassandra laughed
cressida but there was more temperate fire under the pot of
 her eyes did her eyes run o'er too
pandarus and hector laughed
cressida at what was all this laughing
pandarus marry at the white hair that helen spied on troilus chin
cressida an't had been a green hair i should have laughed
 too
pandarus they laughed not so much at the hair as at his pretty answer
cressida what was his answer
pandarus quoth she here's but two and fifty hairs on your
 chin and one of them is white
cressida this is her question
pandarus that's true make no question of that two and
 fifty hairs quoth he and one white that white
 hair is my father and all the rest are his sons'
 jupiter quoth she which of these hairs is paris
 my husband the forked one quoth he pluck't
 out and give it him but there was such laughing
 and helen so blushed an paris so chafed and all the
 rest so laughed that it passed
cressida so let it now for it has been while going by
pandarus well cousin i told you a thing yesterday think on't
cressida so i do
pandarus i'll be sworn tis true he will weep you an twere
 a man born in april
cressida and i'll spring up in his tears an twere a nettle
 against may
 a retreat sounded
pandarus hark they are coming from the field shall we
 stand up here and see them as they pass toward
 ilium good niece do sweet niece cressida
cressida at your pleasure
pandarus here here here's an excellent place here we may
 see most bravely i'll tell you them all by their
 names as they pass by but mark troilus above the rest
cressida speak not so loud
 aeneas passes
