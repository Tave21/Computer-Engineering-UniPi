 as i return i will fetch off these justices i do
 see the bottom of justice shallow lord lord how
 subject we old men are to this vice of lying this
 same starved justice hath done nothing but prate to
 me of the wildness of his youth and the feats he
 hath done about turnbull street and every third
 word a lie duer paid to the hearer than the turk's
 tribute i do remember him at clement's inn like a
 man made after supper of a cheeseparing when a'
 was naked he was for all the world like a forked
 radish with a head fantastically carved upon it
 with a knife a was so forlorn that his
 dimensions to any thick sight were invincible a'
 was the very genius of famine yet lecherous as a
 monkey and the whores called him mandrake a came
 ever in the rearward of the fashion and sung those
 tunes to the overscutched huswives that he heard the
 carmen whistle and swear they were his fancies or
 his goodnights and now is this vice's dagger
 become a squire and talks as familiarly of john a
 gaunt as if he had been sworn brother to him and
 i'll be sworn a ne'er saw him but once in the
 tiltyard and then he burst his head for crowding
 among the marshal's men i saw it and told john a
 gaunt he beat his own name for you might have
 thrust him and all his apparel into an eelskin the
 case of a treble hautboy was a mansion for him a
 court and now has he land and beefs well i'll
 be acquainted with him if i return and it shall
 go hard but i will make him a philosopher's two
 stones to me if the young dace be a bait for the
 old pike i see no reason in the law of nature but i
 may snap at him let time shape and there an end
 exit
