claudio hath leonato any son my lord
don pedro no child but hero she's his only heir
 dost thou affect her claudio
claudio o my lord
 when you went onward on this ended action
 i look'd upon her with a soldier's eye
 that liked but had a rougher task in hand
 than to drive liking to the name of love
 but now i am return'd and that warthoughts
 have left their places vacant in their rooms
 come thronging soft and delicate desires
 all prompting me how fair young hero is
 saying i liked her ere i went to wars
don pedro thou wilt be like a lover presently
 and tire the hearer with a book of words
 if thou dost love fair hero cherish it
 and i will break with her and with her father
 and thou shalt have her was't not to this end
 that thou began'st to twist so fine a story
claudio how sweetly you do minister to love
 that know love's grief by his complexion
 but lest my liking might too sudden seem
 i would have salved it with a longer treatise
don pedro what need the bridge much broader than the flood
 the fairest grant is the necessity
 look what will serve is fit tis once thou lovest
 and i will fit thee with the remedy
 i know we shall have revelling tonight
 i will assume thy part in some disguise
 and tell fair hero i am claudio
 and in her bosom i'll unclasp my heart
 and take her hearing prisoner with the force
 and strong encounter of my amorous tale
 then after to her father will i break
 and the conclusion is she shall be thine
 in practise let us put it presently

scene iii the same
 enter don john and conrade
conrade what the goodyear my lord why are you thus out
 of measure sad
don john there is no measure in the occasion that breeds
 therefore the sadness is without limit
conrade you should hear reason
don john and when i have heard it what blessing brings it
conrade if not a present remedy at least a patient
 sufferance
don john i wonder that thou being as thou sayest thou art
 born under saturn goest about to apply a moral
 medicine to a mortifying mischief i cannot hide
 what i am i must be sad when i have cause and smile
 at no man's jests eat when i have stomach and wait
 for no man's leisure sleep when i am drowsy and
 tend on no man's business laugh when i am merry and
 claw no man in his humour
conrade yea but you must not make the full show of this
 till you may do it without controlment you have of
 late stood out against your brother and he hath
 ta'en you newly into his grace where it is
 impossible you should take true root but by the
 fair weather that you make yourself it is needful
 that you frame the season for your own harvest
don john i had rather be a canker in a hedge than a rose in
 his grace and it better fits my blood to be
 disdained of all than to fashion a carriage to rob
 love from any in this though i cannot be said to
 be a flattering honest man it must not be denied
 but i am a plaindealing villain i am trusted with
 a muzzle and enfranchised with a clog therefore i
 have decreed not to sing in my cage if i had my
 mouth i would bite if i had my liberty i would do
 my liking in the meantime let me be that i am and
 seek not to alter me
conrade can you make no use of your discontent
don john i make all use of it for i use it only
 who comes here
 enter borachio
 what news borachio
borachio i came yonder from a great supper the prince your
 brother is royally entertained by leonato and i
 can give you intelligence of an intended marriage
don john will it serve for any model to build mischief on
 what is he for a fool that betroths himself to
 unquietness
borachio marry it is your brother's right hand
don john who the most exquisite claudio
borachio even he
don john a proper squire and who and who which way looks
 he

don john a very forward marchchick how came you to this
borachio being entertained for a perfumer as i was smoking a
 musty room comes me the prince and claudio hand
 in hand in sad conference i whipt me behind the
 arras and there heard it agreed upon that the
 prince should woo hero for himself and having
 obtained her give her to count claudio
don john come come let us thither this may prove food to
 my displeasure that young startup hath all the
 glory of my overthrow if i can cross him any way i
 bless myself every way you are both sure and will assist me
conrade to the death my lord
don john let us to the great supper their cheer is the
 greater that i am subdued would the cook were of
 my mind shall we go prove what's to be done
borachio we'll wait upon your lordship

act ii
scene i a hall in leonato's house
 enter leonato antonio hero beatrice and others
leonato was not count john here at supper
antonio i saw him not
beatrice how tartly that gentleman looks i never can see
 him but i am heartburned an hour after
hero he is of a very melancholy disposition
beatrice he were an excellent man that were made just in the
 midway between him and benedick the one is too
 like an image and says nothing and the other too
 like my lady's eldest son evermore tattling
leonato then half signior benedick's tongue in count john's
 mouth and half count john's melancholy in signior
 benedick's face
beatrice with a good leg and a good foot uncle and money
 enough in his purse such a man would win any woman
 in the world if a could get her goodwill
leonato by my troth niece thou wilt never get thee a
 husband if thou be so shrewd of thy tongue
antonio in faith she's too curst
beatrice too curst is more than curst i shall lessen god's
 sending that way for it is said god sends a curst
 cow short horns but to a cow too curst he sends none
leonato so by being too curst god will send you no horns
beatrice just if he send me no husband for the which
 blessing i am at him upon my knees every morning and
 evening lord i could not endure a husband with a
 beard on his face i had rather lie in the woollen
leonato you may light on a husband that hath no beard
beatrice what should i do with him dress him in my apparel
 and make him my waitinggentlewoman he that hath a
 beard is more than a youth and he that hath no
 beard is less than a man and he that is more than
 a youth is not for me and he that is less than a
 man i am not for him therefore i will even take
 sixpence in earnest of the bearward and lead his
 apes into hell
leonato well then go you into hell
beatrice no but to the gate and there will the devil meet
 me like an old cuckold with horns on his head and
 say get you to heaven beatrice get you to
 heaven here's no place for you maids so deliver
 i up my apes and away to saint peter for the
 heavens he shows me where the bachelors sit and
 there live we as merry as the day is long
antonio to hero well niece i trust you will be ruled
 by your father
beatrice yes faith it is my cousin's duty to make curtsy
 and say father as it please you but yet for all
 that cousin let him be a handsome fellow or else
 make another curtsy and say father as it please
 me'
leonato well niece i hope to see you one day fitted with a husband
beatrice not till god make men of some other metal than
 earth would it not grieve a woman to be
 overmastered with a pierce of valiant dust to make
 an account of her life to a clod of wayward marl
 no uncle i'll none adam's sons are my brethren
 and truly i hold it a sin to match in my kindred
