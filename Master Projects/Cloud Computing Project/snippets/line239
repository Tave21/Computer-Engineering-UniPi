gloucester weapons arms what s the matter here
cornwall keep peace upon your lives
 he dies that strikes again what is the matter
regan the messengers from our sister and the king
cornwall what is your difference speak
oswald i am scarce in breath my lord
kent no marvel you have so bestirred your valour you
 cowardly rascal nature disclaims in thee a
 tailor made thee

 hours at the trade

 unbolted villain into mortar and daub the wall of
 a jakes with him spare my gray beard you wagtail
cornwall peace sirrah
 you beastly knave know you no reverence
kent yes sir but anger hath a privilege
cornwall why art thou angry
kent that such a slave as this should wear a sword
 who wears no honesty such smiling rogues as these
 like rats oft bite the holy cords atwain
 which are too intrinse t unloose smooth every passion
 that in the natures of their lords rebel
 bring oil to fire snow to their colder moods
 renege affirm and turn their halcyon beaks
 with every gale and vary of their masters
 knowing nought like dogs but following
 a plague upon your epileptic visage
 smile you my speeches as i were a fool
 goose if i had you upon sarum plain
 i'ld drive ye cackling home to camelot
cornwall why art thou mad old fellow
gloucester how fell you out say that
kent no contraries hold more antipathy
 than i and such a knave
cornwall why dost thou call him a knave what's his offence
kent his countenance likes me not
cornwall no more perchance does mine nor his nor hers
kent sir tis my occupation to be plain
 i have seen better faces in my time
 than stands on any shoulder that i see
 before me at this instant
cornwall this is some fellow
 who having been praised for bluntness doth affect
 a saucy roughness and constrains the garb
 quite from his nature he cannot flatter he
 an honest mind and plain he must speak truth
 an they will take it so if not he's plain
 these kind of knaves i know which in this plainness
 harbour more craft and more corrupter ends
 than twenty silly ducking observants
 that stretch their duties nicely
kent sir in good sooth in sincere verity
 under the allowance of your great aspect
 whose influence like the wreath of radiant fire
 on flickering phoebus front
cornwall what mean'st by this
kent to go out of my dialect which you
 discommend so much i know sir i am no
 flatterer he that beguiled you in a plain
 accent was a plain knave which for my part
 i will not be though i should win your displeasure
 to entreat me to t
cornwall what was the offence you gave him
oswald i never gave him any
 it pleased the king his master very late
 to strike at me upon his misconstruction
 when he conjunct and flattering his displeasure
 tripp'd me behind being down insulted rail'd
 and put upon him such a deal of man
 that worthied him got praises of the king
 for him attempting who was selfsubdued
 and in the fleshment of this dread exploit
 drew on me here again
kent none of these rogues and cowards
 but ajax is their fool
cornwall fetch forth the stocks
 you stubborn ancient knave you reverend braggart
 we'll teach you
kent sir i am too old to learn
 call not your stocks for me i serve the king
 on whose employment i was sent to you
 you shall do small respect show too bold malice
 against the grace and person of my master
 stocking his messenger
cornwall fetch forth the stocks as i have life and honour
 there shall he sit till noon
regan till noon till night my lord and all night too
kent why madam if i were your father's dog
 you should not use me so
regan sir being his knave i will
cornwall this is a fellow of the selfsame colour
 our sister speaks of come bring away the stocks
 stocks brought out
gloucester let me beseech your grace not to do so
 his fault is much and the good king his master
 will cheque him for t your purposed low correction
 is such as basest and contemned'st wretches
 for pilferings and most common trespasses
 are punish'd with the king must take it ill
 that he's so slightly valued in his messenger
 should have him thus restrain'd
cornwall i'll answer that
regan my sister may receive it much more worse
 to have her gentleman abused assaulted
 for following her affairs put in his legs
 kent is put in the stocks
 come my good lord away
 exeunt all but gloucester and kent
gloucester i am sorry for thee friend tis the duke's pleasure
 whose disposition all the world well knows
 will not be rubb'd nor stopp'd i'll entreat for thee
kent pray do not sir i have watched and travell'd hard
 some time i shall sleep out the rest i'll whistle
 a good man's fortune may grow out at heels
 give you good morrow
gloucester the duke's to blame in this twill be ill taken
 exit
kent good king that must approve the common saw
 thou out of heaven's benediction comest
