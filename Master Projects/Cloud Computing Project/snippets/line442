 enter angelo
angelo now what's the matter provost
provost is it your will claudio shall die tomorrow
angelo did not i tell thee yea hadst thou not order
 why dost thou ask again
provost lest i might be too rash
 under your good correction i have seen
 when after execution judgment hath
 repented o'er his doom
angelo go to let that be mine
 do you your office or give up your place
 and you shall well be spared
provost i crave your honour's pardon
 what shall be done sir with the groaning juliet
 she's very near her hour
angelo dispose of her
 to some more fitter place and that with speed
 reenter servant

 enter isabella and lucio
provost god save your honour
angelo stay a little while
 to isabella
 you're welcome what's your will
isabella i am a woeful suitor to your honour
 please but your honour hear me
angelo well what's your suit
isabella there is a vice that most i do abhor
 and most desire should meet the blow of justice
 for which i would not plead but that i must
 for which i must not plead but that i am
 at war twixt will and will not
angelo well the matter
isabella i have a brother is condemn'd to die
 i do beseech you let it be his fault
 and not my brother
provost aside heaven give thee moving graces
angelo condemn the fault and not the actor of it
 why every fault's condemn'd ere it be done
 mine were the very cipher of a function
 to fine the faults whose fine stands in record
 and let go by the actor
isabella o just but severe law
 i had a brother then heaven keep your honour
lucio aside to isabella give't not o'er so to him
 again entreat him
 kneel down before him hang upon his gown
 you are too cold if you should need a pin
 you could not with more tame a tongue desire it
 to him i say
isabella must he needs die
angelo maiden no remedy
isabella yes i do think that you might pardon him
 and neither heaven nor man grieve at the mercy
angelo i will not do't
isabella but can you if you would
angelo look what i will not that i cannot do
isabella but might you do't and do the world no wrong
 if so your heart were touch'd with that remorse
 as mine is to him
angelo he's sentenced tis too late
lucio aside to isabella you are too cold
isabella too late why no i that do speak a word
 may call it back again well believe this
 no ceremony that to great ones longs
 not the king's crown nor the deputed sword
 the marshal's truncheon nor the judge's robe
 become them with one half so good a grace
 as mercy does
 if he had been as you and you as he
 you would have slipt like him but he like you
 would not have been so stern
angelo pray you be gone
isabella i would to heaven i had your potency
 and you were isabel should it then be thus
 no i would tell what twere to be a judge
 and what a prisoner
lucio aside to isabella
 ay touch him there's the vein
angelo your brother is a forfeit of the law
 and you but waste your words
isabella alas alas
 why all the souls that were were forfeit once
 and he that might the vantage best have took
 found out the remedy how would you be
 if he which is the top of judgment should
 but judge you as you are o think on that
 and mercy then will breathe within your lips
 like man new made
angelo be you content fair maid
 it is the law not i condemn your brother
 were he my kinsman brother or my son
 it should be thus with him he must die tomorrow
isabella tomorrow o that's sudden spare him spare him
 he's not prepared for death even for our kitchens
 we kill the fowl of season shall we serve heaven
 with less respect than we do minister
 to our gross selves good good my lord bethink you
 who is it that hath died for this offence
 there's many have committed it
lucio aside to isabella ay well said
angelo the law hath not been dead though it hath slept
 those many had not dared to do that evil
 if the first that did the edict infringe
 had answer'd for his deed now tis awake
 takes note of what is done and like a prophet
 looks in a glass that shows what future evils
 either new or by remissness newconceived
 and so in progress to be hatch'd and born
 are now to have no successive degrees
 but ere they live to end
isabella yet show some pity
angelo i show it most of all when i show justice
 for then i pity those i do not know
 which a dismiss'd offence would after gall
 and do him right that answering one foul wrong
 lives not to act another be satisfied
 your brother dies tomorrow be content
isabella so you must be the first that gives this sentence
 and he that suffer's o it is excellent
 to have a giant's strength but it is tyrannous
 to use it like a giant
lucio aside to isabella that's well said
isabella could great men thunder
 as jove himself does jove would ne'er be quiet
 for every pelting petty officer
 would use his heaven for thunder
 nothing but thunder merciful heaven
 thou rather with thy sharp and sulphurous bolt
 split'st the unwedgeable and gnarled oak
 than the soft myrtle but man proud man
 drest in a little brief authority
 most ignorant of what he's most assured
