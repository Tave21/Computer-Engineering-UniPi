 thou know'st we parted but perhaps my son
 thou shamest to acknowledge me in misery
antipholus
of ephesus the duke and all that know me in the city
 can witness with me that it is not so
 i ne'er saw syracusa in my life
duke solinus i tell thee syracusian twenty years
 have i been patron to antipholus
 during which time he ne'er saw syracusa
 i see thy age and dangers make thee dote
 reenter aemilia with antipholus of syracuse and
 dromio of syracuse
aemelia most mighty duke behold a man much wrong'd
 all gather to see them
adriana i see two husbands or mine eyes deceive me
duke solinus one of these men is genius to the other
 and so of these which is the natural man
 and which the spirit who deciphers them
dromio of syracuse i sir am dromio command him away
dromio of ephesus i sir am dromio pray let me stay
antipholus
of syracuse aegeon art thou not or else his ghost
dromio of syracuse o my old master who hath bound him here
aemelia whoever bound him i will loose his bonds
 and gain a husband by his liberty
 speak old aegeon if thou be'st the man
 that hadst a wife once call'd aemilia
 that bore thee at a burden two fair sons
 o if thou be'st the same aegeon speak
 and speak unto the same aemilia
aegeon if i dream not thou art aemilia
 if thou art she tell me where is that son
 that floated with thee on the fatal raft
aemelia by men of epidamnum he and i
 and the twin dromio all were taken up
 but by and by rude fishermen of corinth
 by force took dromio and my son from them
 and me they left with those of epidamnum
 what then became of them i cannot tell
 i to this fortune that you see me in
duke solinus why here begins his morning story right
 these two antipholuses these two so like
 and these two dromios one in semblance
 besides her urging of her wreck at sea
 these are the parents to these children
 which accidentally are met together
 antipholus thou camest from corinth first
antipholus
of syracuse no sir not i i came from syracuse
duke solinus stay stand apart i know not which is which
antipholus
of ephesus i came from corinth my most gracious lord
dromio of ephesus and i with him
antipholus
of ephesus brought to this town by that most famous warrior
 duke menaphon your most renowned uncle
adriana which of you two did dine with me today
antipholus
of syracuse i gentle mistress
adriana and are not you my husband
antipholus
of ephesus no i say nay to that
antipholus
of syracuse and so do i yet did she call me so
 and this fair gentlewoman her sister here
 did call me brother
 to luciana
 what i told you then
 i hope i shall have leisure to make good
 if this be not a dream i see and hear
angelo that is the chain sir which you had of me
antipholus
of syracuse i think it be sir i deny it not
antipholus
of ephesus and you sir for this chain arrested me
angelo i think i did sir i deny it not
adriana i sent you money sir to be your bail
 by dromio but i think he brought it not
dromio of ephesus no none by me
antipholus
of syracuse this purse of ducats i received from you
 and dromio my man did bring them me
 i see we still did meet each other's man
 and i was ta'en for him and he for me
 and thereupon these errors are arose
antipholus
of ephesus these ducats pawn i for my father here
duke solinus it shall not need thy father hath his life
courtezan sir i must have that diamond from you
antipholus
of ephesus there take it and much thanks for my good cheer
aemelia renowned duke vouchsafe to take the pains
 to go with us into the abbey here
 and hear at large discoursed all our fortunes
 and all that are assembled in this place
 that by this sympathized one day's error
 have suffer'd wrong go keep us company
 and we shall make full satisfaction
 thirtythree years have i but gone in travail
 of you my sons and till this present hour
 my heavy burden ne'er delivered
 the duke my husband and my children both
 and you the calendars of their nativity
 go to a gossips feast and go with me
 after so long grief such festivity
duke solinus with all my heart i'll gossip at this feast
 exeunt all but antipholus of syracuse antipholus
 of ephesus dromio of syracuse and dromio of ephesus
dromio of syracuse master shall i fetch your stuff from shipboard
antipholus
of ephesus dromio what stuff of mine hast thou embark'd

 i see by you i am a sweetfaced youth

dromio of ephesus that's a question how shall we try it

first gentleman his daughter and the heir of's kingdom whom
 he purposed to his wife's sole sona widow
