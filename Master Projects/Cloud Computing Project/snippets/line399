 ergo light wenches will burn come not near her
courtezan your man and you are marvellous merry sir
 will you go with me we'll mend our dinner here
dromio of syracuse master if you do expect spoonmeat or bespeak a
 long spoon
antipholus
of syracuse why dromio
dromio of syracuse marry he must have a long spoon that must eat with
 the devil
antipholus
of syracuse avoid then fiend what tell'st thou me of supping
 thou art as you are all a sorceress
 i conjure thee to leave me and be gone
courtezan give me the ring of mine you had at dinner
 or for my diamond the chain you promised
 and i'll be gone sir and not trouble you
dromio of syracuse some devils ask but the parings of one's nail
 a rush a hair a drop of blood a pin
 a nut a cherrystone
 but she more covetous would have a chain
 master be wise an if you give it her
 the devil will shake her chain and fright us with it
courtezan i pray you sir my ring or else the chain
 i hope you do not mean to cheat me so
antipholus
of syracuse avaunt thou witch come dromio let us go
dromio of syracuse fly pride says the peacock mistress that you know
 exeunt antipholus of syracuse and dromio of syracuse
courtezan now out of doubt antipholus is mad
 else would he never so demean himself
 a ring he hath of mine worth forty ducats
 and for the same he promised me a chain
 both one and other he denies me now
 the reason that i gather he is mad
 besides this present instance of his rage
 is a mad tale he told today at dinner
 of his own doors being shut against his entrance
 belike his wife acquainted with his fits
 on purpose shut the doors against his way
 my way is now to hie home to his house
 and tell his wife that being lunatic
 he rush'd into my house and took perforce
 my ring away this course i fittest choose
 for forty ducats is too much to lose
 exit
 the comedy of errors

 beating him
officer good sir be patient

officer good now hold thy tongue
dromio of ephesus nay rather persuade him to hold his hands
antipholus
of ephesus thou whoreson senseless villain
dromio of ephesus i would i were senseless sir that i might not feel
 your blows
antipholus thou art sensible in nothing but blows and so is an
 ass
dromio of ephesus i am an ass indeed you may prove it by my long
 ears i have served him from the hour of my
 nativity to this instant and have nothing at his
 hands for my service but blows when i am cold he
 heats me with beating when i am warm he cools me
 with beating i am waked with it when i sleep
 raised with it when i sit driven out of doors with
 it when i go from home welcomed home with it when
 i return nay i bear it on my shoulders as a
 beggar wont her brat and i think when he hath
 lamed me i shall beg with it from door to door
antipholus
of ephesus come go along my wife is coming yonder
 enter adriana luciana the courtezan and pinch
dromio of ephesus mistress respice finem respect your end or
 rather the prophecy like the parrot beware the
 rope'send'
antipholus
of ephesus wilt thou still talk
 beating him
courtezan how say you now is not your husband mad
adriana his incivility confirms no less
 good doctor pinch you are a conjurer
 establish him in his true sense again
 and i will please you what you will demand
luciana alas how fiery and how sharp he looks
courtezan mark how he trembles in his ecstasy
pinch give me your hand and let me feel your pulse
antipholus
of ephesus there is my hand and let it feel your ear
 striking him
pinch i charge thee satan housed within this man
 to yield possession to my holy prayers
 and to thy state of darkness hie thee straight
 i conjure thee by all the saints in heaven
antipholus
of ephesus peace doting wizard peace i am not mad
adriana o that thou wert not poor distressed soul
antipholus
of ephesus you minion you are these your customers
 did this companion with the saffron face
 revel and feast it at my house today
 whilst upon me the guilty doors were shut
 and i denied to enter in my house
adriana o husband god doth know you dined at home
 where would you had remain'd until this time
 free from these slanders and this open shame
antipholus
of ephesus dined at home thou villain what sayest thou
dromio of ephesus sir sooth to say you did not dine at home
antipholus
of ephesus were not my doors lock'd up and i shut out
dromio of ephesus perdie your doors were lock'd and you shut out
antipholus
of ephesus and did not she herself revile me there
dromio of ephesus sans fable she herself reviled you there
antipholus
of ephesus did not her kitchenmaid rail taunt and scorn me
dromio of ephesus certes she did the kitchenvestal scorn'd you
antipholus
of ephesus and did not i in rage depart from thence
dromio of ephesus in verity you did my bones bear witness
 that since have felt the vigour of his rage
adriana is't good to soothe him in these contraries
pinch it is no shame the fellow finds his vein
 and yielding to him humours well his frenzy
antipholus
of ephesus thou hast suborn'd the goldsmith to arrest me
adriana alas i sent you money to redeem you
 by dromio here who came in haste for it
dromio of ephesus money by me heart and goodwill you might
 but surely master not a rag of money
antipholus
of ephesus went'st not thou to her for a purse of ducats
adriana he came to me and i deliver'd it
luciana and i am witness with her that she did
dromio of ephesus god and the ropemaker bear me witness
 that i was sent for nothing but a rope
pinch mistress both man and master is possess'd
 i know it by their pale and deadly looks
 they must be bound and laid in some dark room
antipholus
of ephesus say wherefore didst thou lock me forth today
 and why dost thou deny the bag of gold
adriana i did not gentle husband lock thee forth
dromio of ephesus and gentle master i received no gold
 but i confess sir that we were lock'd out
adriana dissembling villain thou speak'st false in both
antipholus
of ephesus dissembling harlot thou art false in all
 and art confederate with a damned pack
 to make a loathsome abject scorn of me
 but with these nails i'll pluck out these false eyes
 that would behold in me this shameful sport
 enter three or four and offer to bind him
 he strives
adriana o bind him bind him let him not come near me
pinch more company the fiend is strong within him
luciana ay me poor man how pale and wan he looks
antipholus
of ephesus what will you murder me thou gaoler thou
 i am thy prisoner wilt thou suffer them
 to make a rescue
officer masters let him go
 he is my prisoner and you shall not have him
pinch go bind this man for he is frantic too
 they offer to bind dromio of ephesus
adriana what wilt thou do thou peevish officer
 hast thou delight to see a wretched man
 do outrage and displeasure to himself
officer he is my prisoner if i let him go
 the debt he owes will be required of me
adriana i will discharge thee ere i go from thee
 bear me forthwith unto his creditor
 and knowing how the debt grows i will pay it
 good master doctor see him safe convey'd
 home to my house o most unhappy day
