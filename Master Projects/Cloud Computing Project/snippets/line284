othello rising o she was foul
 i scarce did know you uncle there lies your niece
 whose breath indeed these hands have newly stopp'd
 i know this act shows horrible and grim
gratiano poor desdemona i am glad thy father's dead
 thy match was mortal to him and pure grief
 shore his old thread in twain did he live now
 this sight would make him do a desperate turn
 yea curse his better angel from his side
 and fall to reprobation
othello tis pitiful but yet iago knows
 that she with cassio hath the act of shame
 a thousand times committed cassio confess'd it
 and she did gratify his amorous works
 with that recognizance and pledge of love
 which i first gave her i saw it in his hand
 it was a handkerchief an antique token
 my father gave my mother
emilia o heaven o heavenly powers
iago come hold your peace
emilia twill out twill out i peace
 no i will speak as liberal as the north
 let heaven and men and devils let them all
 all all cry shame against me yet i'll speak
iago be wise and get you home
emilia i will not
 iago offers to stab emilia
gratiano fie
 your sword upon a woman
emilia o thou dull moor that handkerchief thou speak'st of
 i found by fortune and did give my husband
 for often with a solemn earnestness
 more than indeed belong'd to such a trifle
 he begg'd of me to steal it
iago villanous whore
emilia she give it cassio no alas i found it
 and i did give't my husband
iago filth thou liest
emilia by heaven i do not i do not gentlemen
 o murderous coxcomb what should such a fool
 do with so good a woman
othello are there no stones in heaven
 but what serve for the thunderprecious villain
 he runs at iago iago from behind stabs emilia and exit
gratiano the woman falls sure he hath kill'd his wife
emilia ay ay o lay me by my mistress side
gratiano he's gone but his wife's kill'd
montano tis a notorious villain take you this weapon
 which i have here recover'd from the moor
 come guard the door without let him not pass
 but kill him rather i'll after that same villain
 for tis a damned slave
 exeunt montano and gratiano
othello i am not valiant neither
 but ever puny whipster gets my sword
 but why should honour outlive honesty
 let it go all
emilia what did thy song bode lady
 hark canst thou hear me i will play the swan
 and die in music
 singing
 willow willow willow
 moor she was chaste she loved thee cruel moor
 so come my soul to bliss as i speak true
 so speaking as i think i die i die
 dies
othello i have another weapon in this chamber
 it is a sword of spain the icebrook's temper
 o here it is uncle i must come forth
gratiano within if thou attempt it it will cost thee dear
 thou hast no weapon and perforce must suffer
othello look in upon me then and speak with me
 or naked as i am i will assault thee
 reenter gratiano
gratiano what is the matter
othello behold i have a weapon
 a better never did itself sustain
 upon a soldier's thigh i have seen the day
 that with this little arm and this good sword
 i have made my way through more impediments
 than twenty times your stop but o vain boast
 who can control his fate tis not so now
 be not afraid though you do see me weapon'd
 here is my journey's end here is my butt
 and very seamark of my utmost sail
 do you go back dismay'd tis a lost fear
 man but a rush against othello's breast
 and he retires where should othello go
 now how dost thou look now o illstarr'd wench
 pale as thy smock when we shall meet at compt
 this look of thine will hurl my soul from heaven
 and fiends will snatch at it cold cold my girl
 even like thy chastity o cursed slave
 whip me ye devils
 from the possession of this heavenly sight
 blow me about in winds roast me in sulphur
 wash me in steepdown gulfs of liquid fire
 o desdemona desdemona dead
 oh oh oh
 enter lodovico montano cassio carried in a chair
 and officers with iago prisoner
lodovico where is this rash and most unfortunate man
othello that's he that was othello here i am
lodovico where is that viper bring the villain forth
othello i look down towards his feet but that's a fable
 if that thou best a devil i cannot kill thee
 wounds iago
lodovico wrench his sword from him
iago i bleed sir but not kill'd
othello i am not sorry neither i'ld have thee live
 for in my sense tis happiness to die
lodovico o thou othello thou wert once so good
 fall'n in the practise of a damned slave
 what shall be said to thee
othello why any thing
 an honourable murderer if you will
 for nought i did in hate but all in honour
lodovico this wretch hath part confess'd his villany
 did you and he consent in cassio's death
othello ay
cassio dear general i never gave you cause
othello i do believe it and i ask your pardon
 will you i pray demand that demidevil
 why he hath thus ensnared my soul and body
iago demand me nothing what you know you know
 from this time forth i never will speak word
lodovico what not to pray
gratiano torments will ope your lips
othello well thou dost best
lodovico sir you shall understand what hath befall'n
 which as i think you know not here is a letter
 found in the pocket of the slain roderigo
 and here another the one of them imports
 the death of cassio to be undertook
 by roderigo
othello o villain
cassio most heathenish and most gross
lodovico now here's another discontented paper
 found in his pocket too and this it seems
 roderigo meant to have sent this damned villain
 but that belike iago in the interim
 came in and satisfied him
othello o the pernicious caitiff
 how came you cassio by that handkerchief
 that was my wife's
cassio i found it in my chamber
 and he himself confess'd but even now
 that there he dropp'd it for a special purpose
 which wrought to his desire
othello o fool fool fool
cassio there is besides in roderigo's letter
 how he upbraids iago that he made him
 brave me upon the watch whereon it came
 that i was cast and even but now he spake
 after long seeming dead iago hurt him
 iago set him on
lodovico you must forsake this room and go with us
 your power and your command is taken off
 and cassio rules in cyprus for this slave
 if there be any cunning cruelty
 that can torment him much and hold him long
 it shall be his you shall close prisoner rest
 till that the nature of your fault be known
 to the venetian state come bring him away
othello soft you a word or two before you go
 i have done the state some service and they know't
 no more of that i pray you in your letters
 when you shall these unlucky deeds relate
 speak of me as i am nothing extenuate
 nor set down aught in malice then must you speak
 of one that loved not wisely but too well
 of one not easily jealous but being wrought
 perplex'd in the extreme of one whose hand
 like the base indian threw a pearl away
 richer than all his tribe of one whose subdued eyes
 albeit unused to the melting mood
 drop tears as fast as the arabian trees
 their medicinal gum set you down this
 and say besides that in aleppo once
 where a malignant and a turban'd turk
 beat a venetian and traduced the state
 i took by the throat the circumcised dog
 and smote him thus
 stabs himself
lodovico o bloody period
gratiano all that's spoke is marr'd
othello i kiss'd thee ere i kill'd thee no way but this
 killing myself to die upon a kiss
 falls on the bed and dies
cassio this did i fear but thought he had no weapon
 for he was great of heart
lodovico to iago o spartan dog
 more fell than anguish hunger or the sea
 look on the tragic loading of this bed
 this is thy work the object poisons sight
 let it be hid gratiano keep the house
 and seize upon the fortunes of the moor
 for they succeed on you to you lord governor
 remains the censure of this hellish villain
 the time the place the torture o enforce it
