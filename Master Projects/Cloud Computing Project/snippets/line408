 first a very excellent goodconceited thing
 after a wonderful sweet air with admirable rich
 words to it and then let her consider
 song
 hark hark the lark at heaven's gate sings
 and phoebus gins arise
 his steeds to water at those springs
 on chaliced flowers that lies
 and winking marybuds begin
 to ope their golden eyes
 with every thing that pretty is
 my lady sweet arise
 arise arise
cloten so get you gone if this penetrate i will
 consider your music the better if it do not it is
 a vice in her ears which horsehairs and
 calves'guts nor the voice of unpaved eunuch to
 boot can never amend

 which buys admittance oft it doth yea and makes
 diana's rangers false themselves yield up
 their deer to the stand o the stealer and tis gold
 which makes the true man kill'd and saves the thief
 nay sometime hangs both thief and true man what
 can it not do and undo i will make
 one of her women lawyer to me for
 i yet not understand the case myself
 knocks

 for purchasing but trouble the thanks i give
 is telling you that i am poor of thanks
 and scarce can spare them
cloten still i swear i love you
imogen if you but said so twere as deep with me
 if you swear still your recompense is still
 that i regard it not
cloten this is no answer
imogen but that you shall not say i yield being silent
 i would not speak i pray you spare me faith
 i shall unfold equal discourtesy
 to your best kindness one of your great knowing
 should learn being taught forbearance

 by being so verbal and learn now for all
 that i which know my heart do here pronounce
 by the very truth of it i care not for you
 and am so near the lack of charity
 to accuse myselfi hate you which i had rather
 you felt than make't my boast
cloten you sin against
 obedience which you owe your father for
 the contract you pretend with that base wretch
 one bred of alms and foster'd with cold dishes
 with scraps o the court it is no contract none
 and though it be allow'd in meaner parties
 yet who than he more meanto knit their souls
 on whom there is no more dependency
 but brats and beggary in selffigured knot
 yet you are curb'd from that enlargement by
 the consequence o the crown and must not soil
 the precious note of it with a base slave
 a hilding for a livery a squire's cloth
 a pantler not so eminent
imogen profane fellow
 wert thou the son of jupiter and no more
 but what thou art besides thou wert too base
 to be his groom thou wert dignified enough
 even to the point of envy if twere made
 comparative for your virtues to be styled
 the underhangman of his kingdom and hated
 for being preferred so well
cloten the southfog rot him
imogen he never can meet more mischance than come
 to be but named of thee his meanest garment
 that ever hath but clipp'd his body is dearer

imogen i am sprited with a fool
 frighted and anger'd worse go bid my woman
 search for a jewel that too casually
 hath left mine arm it was thy master's shrew me

 of any king's in europe i do think
 i saw't this morning confident i am
 last night twas on mine arm i kiss'd it
 i hope it be not gone to tell my lord
 that i kiss aught but he
pisanio twill not be lost

act ii
scene iv rome philario's house
 enter posthumus and philario
posthumus leonatus fear it not sir i would i were so sure
 to win the king as i am bold her honour
 will remain hers
philario what means do you make to him
posthumus leonatus not any but abide the change of time
 quake in the present winter's state and wish
 that warmer days would come in these sear'd hopes
 i barely gratify your love they failing
 i must die much your debtor
philario your very goodness and your company
 o'erpays all i can do by this your king
 hath heard of great augustus caius lucius
 will do's commission throughly and i think
 he'll grant the tribute send the arrearages
 or look upon our romans whose remembrance
 is yet fresh in their grief
posthumus leonatus i do believe
 statist though i am none nor like to be
 that this will prove a war and you shall hear
 the legions now in gallia sooner landed
