scene verona mantua
 romeo and juliet
 prologue
 two households both alike in dignity
 in fair verona where we lay our scene
 from ancient grudge break to new mutiny
 where civil blood makes civil hands unclean
 from forth the fatal loins of these two foes
 a pair of starcross'd lovers take their life
 whole misadventured piteous overthrows
 do with their death bury their parents strife
 the fearful passage of their deathmark'd love
 and the continuance of their parents rage
 which but their children's end nought could remove
 is now the two hours traffic of our stage
 the which if you with patient ears attend
 what here shall miss our toil shall strive to mend
 romeo and juliet
act i
scene i verona a public place

gregory ay while you live draw your neck out o the collar
sampson i strike quickly being moved
gregory but thou art not quickly moved to strike
sampson a dog of the house of montague moves me
gregory to move is to stir and to be valiant is to stand
 therefore if thou art moved thou runn'st away
sampson a dog of that house shall move me to stand i will
 take the wall of any man or maid of montague's
gregory that shows thee a weak slave for the weakest goes
 to the wall
sampson true and therefore women being the weaker vessels
 are ever thrust to the wall therefore i will push
 montague's men from the wall and thrust his maids
 to the wall
gregory the quarrel is between our masters and us their men
sampson tis all one i will show myself a tyrant when i
 have fought with the men i will be cruel with the
 maids and cut off their heads

 and flourishes his blade in spite of me
 enter montague and lady montague
montague thou villain capulethold me not let me go
lady montague thou shalt not stir a foot to seek a foe
 enter prince with attendants
prince rebellious subjects enemies to peace
 profaners of this neighbourstained steel
 will they not hear what ho you men you beasts
 that quench the fire of your pernicious rage
 with purple fountains issuing from your veins
 on pain of torture from those bloody hands
 throw your mistemper'd weapons to the ground
 and hear the sentence of your moved prince
 three civil brawls bred of an airy word
 by thee old capulet and montague
 have thrice disturb'd the quiet of our streets
 and made verona's ancient citizens
 cast by their grave beseeming ornaments
 to wield old partisans in hands as old
 canker'd with peace to part your canker'd hate
 if ever you disturb our streets again
 your lives shall pay the forfeit of the peace
 for this time all the rest depart away
 you capulet shall go along with me
 and montague come you this afternoon
 to know our further pleasure in this case
 to old freetown our common judgmentplace
 once more on pain of death all men depart
 exeunt all but montague lady montague and benvolio
montague who set this ancient quarrel new abroach
 speak nephew were you by when it began
benvolio here were the servants of your adversary
 and yours close fighting ere i did approach
 i drew to part them in the instant came
 the fiery tybalt with his sword prepared
 which as he breathed defiance to my ears
 he swung about his head and cut the winds
 who nothing hurt withal hiss'd him in scorn
 while we were interchanging thrusts and blows
 came more and more and fought on part and part
 till the prince came who parted either part
lady montague o where is romeo saw you him today
 right glad i am he was not at this fray
benvolio madam an hour before the worshipp'd sun
 peer'd forth the golden window of the east
 a troubled mind drave me to walk abroad
 where underneath the grove of sycamore
 that westward rooteth from the city's side
 so early walking did i see your son
 towards him i made but he was ware of me
 and stole into the covert of the wood
 i measuring his affections by my own
 that most are busied when they're most alone
 pursued my humour not pursuing his
