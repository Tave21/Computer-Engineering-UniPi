 excepting none but good duke humphrey
 and brother york thy acts in ireland
 in bringing them to civil discipline
 thy late exploits done in the heart of france
 when thou wert regent for our sovereign
 have made thee fear'd and honour'd of the people
 join we together for the public good
 in what we can to bridle and suppress
 the pride of suffolk and the cardinal
 with somerset's and buckingham's ambition
 and as we may cherish duke humphrey's deeds
 while they do tend the profit of the land
warwick so god help warwick as he loves the land
 and common profit of his country
york aside and so says york for he hath greatest cause
salisbury then let's make haste away and look unto the main
warwick unto the main o father maine is lost
 that maine which by main force warwick did win
 and would have kept so long as breath did last
 main chance father you meant but i meant maine
 which i will win from france or else be slain
 exeunt warwick and salisbury
york anjou and maine are given to the french
 paris is lost the state of normandy
 stands on a tickle point now they are gone
 suffolk concluded on the articles
 the peers agreed and henry was well pleased
 to change two dukedoms for a duke's fair daughter
 i cannot blame them all what is't to them
 tis thine they give away and not their own
 pirates may make cheap pennyworths of their pillage
 and purchase friends and give to courtezans
 still revelling like lords till all be gone
 while as the silly owner of the goods
 weeps over them and wrings his hapless hands
 and shakes his head and trembling stands aloof
 while all is shared and all is borne away
 ready to starve and dare not touch his own
 so york must sit and fret and bite his tongue
 while his own lands are bargain'd for and sold
 methinks the realms of england france and ireland
 bear that proportion to my flesh and blood
 as did the fatal brand althaea burn'd
 unto the prince's heart of calydon
 anjou and maine both given unto the french
 cold news for me for i had hope of france
 even as i have of fertile england's soil
 a day will come when york shall claim his own
 and therefore i will take the nevils parts
 and make a show of love to proud duke humphrey
 and when i spy advantage claim the crown
 for that's the golden mark i seek to hit
 nor shall proud lancaster usurp my right
 nor hold the sceptre in his childish fist
 nor wear the diadem upon his head
 whose churchlike humours fits not for a crown
 then york be still awhile till time do serve
 watch thou and wake when others be asleep
 to pry into the secrets of the state
 till henry surfeiting in joys of love
 with his new bride and england's dearbought queen
 and humphrey with the peers be fall'n at jars
 then will i raise aloft the milkwhite rose
 with whose sweet smell the air shall be perfumed
 and in my standard bear the arms of york
 to grapple with the house of lancaster
 and force perforce i'll make him yield the crown
 whose bookish rule hath pull'd fair england down

act i
scene ii gloucester's house
 enter gloucester and his duchess
duchess why droops my lord like overripen'd corn
 hanging the head at ceres plenteous load
 why doth the great duke humphrey knit his brows
 as frowning at the favours of the world
 why are thine eyes fixed to the sullen earth
 gazing on that which seems to dim thy sight
 what seest thou there king henry's diadem
 enchased with all the honours of the world
 if so gaze on and grovel on thy face
 until thy head be circled with the same
 put forth thy hand reach at the glorious gold
 what is't too short i'll lengthen it with mine
 and having both together heaved it up
 we'll both together lift our heads to heaven
 and never more abase our sight so low
 as to vouchsafe one glance unto the ground
gloucester o nell sweet nell if thou dost love thy lord
 banish the canker of ambitious thoughts
 and may that thought when i imagine ill
 against my king and nephew virtuous henry
 be my last breathing in this mortal world
 my troublous dream this night doth make me sad
duchess what dream'd my lord tell me and i'll requite it
 with sweet rehearsal of my morning's dream
gloucester methought this staff mine officebadge in court
 was broke in twain by whom i have forgot
 but as i think it was by the cardinal
 and on the pieces of the broken wand
 were placed the heads of edmund duke of somerset
 and william de la pole first duke of suffolk
 this was my dream what it doth bode god knows
duchess tut this was nothing but an argument
 that he that breaks a stick of gloucester's grove
 shall lose his head for his presumption
 but list to me my humphrey my sweet duke
 methought i sat in seat of majesty
 in the cathedral church of westminster
 and in that chair where kings and queens are crown'd
 where henry and dame margaret kneel'd to me
 and on my head did set the diadem
gloucester nay eleanor then must i chide outright
 presumptuous dame illnurtured eleanor
 art thou not second woman in the realm
 and the protector's wife beloved of him
 hast thou not worldly pleasure at command
 above the reach or compass of thy thought
 and wilt thou still be hammering treachery
 to tumble down thy husband and thyself
 from top of honour to disgrace's feet
 away from me and let me hear no more
duchess what what my lord are you so choleric
 with eleanor for telling but her dream
 next time i'll keep my dreams unto myself
 and not be cheque'd
gloucester nay be not angry i am pleased again
 enter messenger
messenger my lord protector tis his highness pleasure
 you do prepare to ride unto saint alban's
 where as the king and queen do mean to hawk
gloucester i go come nell thou wilt ride with us
duchess yes my good lord i'll follow presently
 exeunt gloucester and messenger
 follow i must i cannot go before
 while gloucester bears this base and humble mind
 were i a man a duke and next of blood
 i would remove these tedious stumblingblocks
 and smooth my way upon their headless necks
 and being a woman i will not be slack
 to play my part in fortune's pageant
 where are you there sir john nay fear not man
 we are alone here's none but thee and i
 enter hume
hume jesus preserve your royal majesty
duchess what say'st thou majesty i am but grace
hume but by the grace of god and hume's advice
 your grace's title shall be multiplied
duchess what say'st thou man hast thou as yet conferr'd
 with margery jourdain the cunning witch
 with roger bolingbroke the conjurer
 and will they undertake to do me good
hume this they have promised to show your highness
 a spirit raised from depth of underground
 that shall make answer to such questions
 as by your grace shall be propounded him
duchess it is enough i'll think upon the questions
 when from st alban's we do make return
 we'll see these things effected to the full
 here hume take this reward make merry man
 with thy confederates in this weighty cause
 exit
hume hume must make merry with the duchess gold
 marry and shall but how now sir john hume
 seal up your lips and give no words but mum
 the business asketh silent secrecy
 dame eleanor gives gold to bring the witch
 gold cannot come amiss were she a devil
 yet have i gold flies from another coast
 i dare not say from the rich cardinal
 and from the great and newmade duke of suffolk
 yet i do find it so for to be plain
 they knowing dame eleanor's aspiring humour
 have hired me to undermine the duchess
 and buz these conjurations in her brain
 they say a crafty knave does need no broker'
 yet am i suffolk and the cardinal's broker
 hume if you take not heed you shall go near
 to call them both a pair of crafty knaves
 well so it stands and thus i fear at last
 hume's knavery will be the duchess wreck
 and her attainture will be humphrey's fall
 sort how it will i shall have gold for all
