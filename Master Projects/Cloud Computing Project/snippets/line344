the offender's sorrow lends but weak relief
to him that bears the strong offence's cross
 ah but those tears are pearl which thy love sheds
 and they are rich and ransom all ill deeds
xxxv
no more be grieved at that which thou hast done
roses have thorns and silver fountains mud
clouds and eclipses stain both moon and sun
and loathsome canker lives in sweetest bud
all men make faults and even i in this
authorizing thy trespass with compare
myself corrupting salving thy amiss
excusing thy sins more than thy sins are
for to thy sensual fault i bring in sense
thy adverse party is thy advocate
and gainst myself a lawful plea commence
such civil war is in my love and hate
 that i an accessary needs must be
 to that sweet thief which sourly robs from me
xxxvi
let me confess that we two must be twain
although our undivided loves are one
so shall those blots that do with me remain
without thy help by me be borne alone
in our two loves there is but one respect
though in our lives a separable spite
which though it alter not love's sole effect
yet doth it steal sweet hours from love's delight
i may not evermore acknowledge thee
lest my bewailed guilt should do thee shame
nor thou with public kindness honour me
unless thou take that honour from thy name
 but do not so i love thee in such sort
 as thou being mine mine is thy good report
xxxvii
as a decrepit father takes delight
to see his active child do deeds of youth
so i made lame by fortune's dearest spite
take all my comfort of thy worth and truth
for whether beauty birth or wealth or wit
or any of these all or all or more
entitled in thy parts do crowned sit
i make my love engrafted to this store
so then i am not lame poor nor despised
whilst that this shadow doth such substance give
that i in thy abundance am sufficed
and by a part of all thy glory live
 look what is best that best i wish in thee
 this wish i have then ten times happy me
xxxviii
how can my muse want subject to invent
while thou dost breathe that pour'st into my verse
thine own sweet argument too excellent
for every vulgar paper to rehearse
o give thyself the thanks if aught in me
worthy perusal stand against thy sight
for who's so dumb that cannot write to thee
when thou thyself dost give invention light
be thou the tenth muse ten times more in worth
than those old nine which rhymers invocate
and he that calls on thee let him bring forth
eternal numbers to outlive long date
 if my slight muse do please these curious days
 the pain be mine but thine shall be the praise
xxxix
o how thy worth with manners may i sing
when thou art all the better part of me
what can mine own praise to mine own self bring
and what is t but mine own when i praise thee
even for this let us divided live
and our dear love lose name of single one
that by this separation i may give
that due to thee which thou deservest alone
o absence what a torment wouldst thou prove
were it not thy sour leisure gave sweet leave
to entertain the time with thoughts of love
which time and thoughts so sweetly doth deceive
 and that thou teachest how to make one twain
 by praising him here who doth hence remain
xl
take all my loves my love yea take them all
what hast thou then more than thou hadst before
no love my love that thou mayst true love call
all mine was thine before thou hadst this more
then if for my love thou my love receivest
i cannot blame thee for my love thou usest
but yet be blamed if thou thyself deceivest
by wilful taste of what thyself refusest
i do forgive thy robbery gentle thief
although thou steal thee all my poverty
and yet love knows it is a greater grief
to bear love's wrong than hate's known injury
 lascivious grace in whom all ill well shows
 kill me with spites yet we must not be foes
xli
those petty wrongs that liberty commits
when i am sometime absent from thy heart
thy beauty and thy years full well befits
for still temptation follows where thou art
gentle thou art and therefore to be won
beauteous thou art therefore to be assailed
and when a woman woos what woman's son
will sourly leave her till she have prevailed
ay me but yet thou mightest my seat forbear
and chide try beauty and thy straying youth
who lead thee in their riot even there
where thou art forced to break a twofold truth
 hers by thy beauty tempting her to thee
 thine by thy beauty being false to me
xlii
that thou hast her it is not all my grief
and yet it may be said i loved her dearly
that she hath thee is of my wailing chief
a loss in love that touches me more nearly
loving offenders thus i will excuse ye
thou dost love her because thou knowst i love her
and for my sake even so doth she abuse me
suffering my friend for my sake to approve her
if i lose thee my loss is my love's gain
and losing her my friend hath found that loss
both find each other and i lose both twain
and both for my sake lay on me this cross
 but here's the joy my friend and i are one
 sweet flattery then she loves but me alone
xliii
when most i wink then do mine eyes best see
for all the day they view things unrespected
but when i sleep in dreams they look on thee
and darkly bright are bright in dark directed
then thou whose shadow shadows doth make bright
how would thy shadow's form form happy show
to the clear day with thy much clearer light
when to unseeing eyes thy shade shines so
how would i say mine eyes be blessed made
by looking on thee in the living day
when in dead night thy fair imperfect shade
through heavy sleep on sightless eyes doth stay
 all days are nights to see till i see thee
 and nights bright days when dreams do show thee me
xliv
if the dull substance of my flesh were thought
injurious distance should not stop my way
for then despite of space i would be brought
from limits far remote where thou dost stay
no matter then although my foot did stand
upon the farthest earth removed from thee
for nimble thought can jump both sea and land
as soon as think the place where he would be
but ah thought kills me that i am not thought
to leap large lengths of miles when thou art gone
but that so much of earth and water wrought
i must attend time's leisure with my moan
 receiving nought by elements so slow
 but heavy tears badges of either's woe
xlv
the other two slight air and purging fire
are both with thee wherever i abide
the first my thought the other my desire
these presentabsent with swift motion slide
for when these quicker elements are gone
in tender embassy of love to thee
my life being made of four with two alone
sinks down to death oppress'd with melancholy
until life's composition be recured
by those swift messengers return'd from thee
who even but now come back again assured
of thy fair health recounting it to me
 this told i joy but then no longer glad
 i send them back again and straight grow sad
xlvi
mine eye and heart are at a mortal war
how to divide the conquest of thy sight
mine eye my heart thy picture's sight would bar
my heart mine eye the freedom of that right
my heart doth plead that thou in him dost lie
a closet never pierced with crystal eyes
but the defendant doth that plea deny
and says in him thy fair appearance lies
to cide this title is impanneled
a quest of thoughts all tenants to the heart
and by their verdict is determined
the clear eye's moiety and the dear heart's part
 as thus mine eye's due is thy outward part
 and my heart's right thy inward love of heart
xlvii
betwixt mine eye and heart a league is took
and each doth good turns now unto the other
when that mine eye is famish'd for a look
or heart in love with sighs himself doth smother
with my love's picture then my eye doth feast
and to the painted banquet bids my heart
another time mine eye is my heart's guest
and in his thoughts of love doth share a part
so either by thy picture or my love
thyself away art resent still with me
for thou not farther than my thoughts canst move
and i am still with them and they with thee
 or if they sleep thy picture in my sight
 awakes my heart to heart's and eye's delight
xlviii
