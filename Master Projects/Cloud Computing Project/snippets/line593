silvia had i been seized by a hungry lion
 i would have been a breakfast to the beast
 rather than have false proteus rescue me
 o heaven be judge how i love valentine
 whose life's as tender to me as my soul
 and full as much for more there cannot be
 i do detest false perjured proteus
 therefore be gone solicit me no more
proteus what dangerous action stood it next to death
 would i not undergo for one calm look
 o tis the curse in love and still approved
 when women cannot love where they're beloved
silvia when proteus cannot love where he's beloved
 read over julia's heart thy first best love
 for whose dear sake thou didst then rend thy faith
 into a thousand oaths and all those oaths
 descended into perjury to love me
 thou hast no faith left now unless thou'dst two
 and that's far worse than none better have none
 than plural faith which is too much by one
 thou counterfeit to thy true friend
proteus in love
 who respects friend
silvia all men but proteus
proteus nay if the gentle spirit of moving words
 can no way change you to a milder form
 i'll woo you like a soldier at arms end
 and love you gainst the nature of loveforce ye
silvia o heaven
proteus i'll force thee yield to my desire
valentine ruffian let go that rude uncivil touch
 thou friend of an ill fashion
proteus valentine
valentine thou common friend that's without faith or love
 for such is a friend now treacherous man
 thou hast beguiled my hopes nought but mine eye
 could have persuaded me now i dare not say
 i have one friend alive thou wouldst disprove me
 who should be trusted when one's own right hand
 is perjured to the bosom proteus
 i am sorry i must never trust thee more
 but count the world a stranger for thy sake
 the private wound is deepest o time most accurst
 mongst all foes that a friend should be the worst
proteus my shame and guilt confounds me
 forgive me valentine if hearty sorrow
 be a sufficient ransom for offence
 i tender t here i do as truly suffer
 as e'er i did commit
valentine then i am paid
 and once again i do receive thee honest
 who by repentance is not satisfied
 is nor of heaven nor earth for these are pleased
 by penitence the eternal's wrath's appeased
 and that my love may appear plain and free
 all that was mine in silvia i give thee
julia o me unhappy
 swoons
proteus look to the boy
valentine why boy why wag how now what's the matter
 look up speak
julia o good sir my master charged me to deliver a ring
 to madam silvia which out of my neglect was never done
proteus where is that ring boy
julia here tis this is it
proteus how let me see
 why this is the ring i gave to julia
julia o cry you mercy sir i have mistook
 this is the ring you sent to silvia
proteus but how camest thou by this ring at my depart
 i gave this unto julia
julia and julia herself did give it me
 and julia herself hath brought it hither
proteus how julia
julia behold her that gave aim to all thy oaths
 and entertain'd em deeply in her heart
 how oft hast thou with perjury cleft the root
 o proteus let this habit make thee blush
 be thou ashamed that i have took upon me
 such an immodest raiment if shame live
 in a disguise of love
 it is the lesser blot modesty finds
 women to change their shapes than men their minds
proteus than men their minds tis true
 o heaven were man
 but constant he were perfect that one error
 fills him with faults makes him run through all the sins
 inconstancy falls off ere it begins
 what is in silvia's face but i may spy
 more fresh in julia's with a constant eye
valentine come come a hand from either
 let me be blest to make this happy close
 twere pity two such friends should be long foes
proteus bear witness heaven i have my wish for ever
julia and i mine
 enter outlaws with duke and thurio
outlaws a prize a prize a prize
valentine forbear forbear i say it is my lord the duke
 your grace is welcome to a man disgraced
 banished valentine
duke sir valentine
thurio yonder is silvia and silvia's mine
valentine thurio give back or else embrace thy death
 come not within the measure of my wrath
 do not name silvia thine if once again
 verona shall not hold thee here she stands
 take but possession of her with a touch
 i dare thee but to breathe upon my love
thurio sir valentine i care not for her i
 i hold him but a fool that will endanger
 his body for a girl that loves him not
 i claim her not and therefore she is thine
duke the more degenerate and base art thou
 to make such means for her as thou hast done
 and leave her on such slight conditions
 now by the honour of my ancestry
 i do applaud thy spirit valentine
 and think thee worthy of an empress love
 know then i here forget all former griefs
 cancel all grudge repeal thee home again
 plead a new state in thy unrivall'd merit
 to which i thus subscribe sir valentine
 thou art a gentleman and well derived
 take thou thy silvia for thou hast deserved her
valentine i thank your grace the gift hath made me happy
 i now beseech you for your daughter's sake
 to grant one boom that i shall ask of you
duke i grant it for thine own whate'er it be
valentine these banish'd men that i have kept withal
 are men endued with worthy qualities
 forgive them what they have committed here
 and let them be recall'd from their exile
 they are reformed civil full of good
 and fit for great employment worthy lord
duke thou hast prevail'd i pardon them and thee
 dispose of them as thou know'st their deserts
 come let us go we will include all jars
 with triumphs mirth and rare solemnity
valentine and as we walk along i dare be bold
 with our discourse to make your grace to smile
 what think you of this page my lord
duke i think the boy hath grace in him he blushes
valentine i warrant you my lord more grace than boy
duke what mean you by that saying
valentine please you i'll tell you as we pass along
 that you will wonder what hath fortuned
 come proteus tis your penance but to hear
 the story of your loves discovered
 that done our day of marriage shall be yours
 one feast one house one mutual happiness
