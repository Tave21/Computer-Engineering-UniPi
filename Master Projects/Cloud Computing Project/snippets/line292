act ii
scene v capulet's orchard
 enter juliet
juliet the clock struck nine when i did send the nurse
 in half an hour she promised to return
 perchance she cannot meet him that's not so
 o she is lame love's heralds should be thoughts
 which ten times faster glide than the sun's beams
 driving back shadows over louring hills
 therefore do nimblepinion'd doves draw love
 and therefore hath the windswift cupid wings
 now is the sun upon the highmost hill
 of this day's journey and from nine till twelve
 is three long hours yet she is not come
 had she affections and warm youthful blood
 she would be as swift in motion as a ball
 my words would bandy her to my sweet love
 and his to me
 but old folks many feign as they were dead
 unwieldy slow heavy and pale as lead
 o god she comes
 enter nurse and peter
 o honey nurse what news
 hast thou met with him send thy man away
nurse peter stay at the gate
 exit peter
juliet now good sweet nurseo lord why look'st thou sad
 though news be sad yet tell them merrily
 if good thou shamest the music of sweet news
 by playing it to me with so sour a face
nurse i am aweary give me leave awhile
 fie how my bones ache what a jaunt have i had
juliet i would thou hadst my bones and i thy news
 nay come i pray thee speak good good nurse speak
nurse jesu what haste can you not stay awhile
 do you not see that i am out of breath
juliet how art thou out of breath when thou hast breath
 to say to me that thou art out of breath
 the excuse that thou dost make in this delay
 is longer than the tale thou dost excuse
 is thy news good or bad answer to that
 say either and i'll stay the circumstance
 let me be satisfied is't good or bad
nurse well you have made a simple choice you know not
 how to choose a man romeo no not he though his
 face be better than any man's yet his leg excels
 all men's and for a hand and a foot and a body
 though they be not to be talked on yet they are
 past compare he is not the flower of courtesy
 but i'll warrant him as gentle as a lamb go thy
 ways wench serve god what have you dined at home
juliet no no but all this did i know before
 what says he of our marriage what of that
nurse lord how my head aches what a head have i

 but you shall bear the burden soon at night

 romeo and juliet
act ii
scene vi friar laurence's cell
 enter friar laurence and romeo
friar laurence so smile the heavens upon this holy act
 that after hours with sorrow chide us not
romeo amen amen but come what sorrow can
 it cannot countervail the exchange of joy
 that one short minute gives me in her sight
 do thou but close our hands with holy words
 then lovedevouring death do what he dare
 it is enough i may but call her mine
friar laurence these violent delights have violent ends
 and in their triumph die like fire and powder
 which as they kiss consume the sweetest honey
 is loathsome in his own deliciousness
 and in the taste confounds the appetite
 therefore love moderately long love doth so
 too swift arrives as tardy as too slow
 enter juliet
 here comes the lady o so light a foot
 will ne'er wear out the everlasting flint
 a lover may bestride the gossamer
 that idles in the wanton summer air
 and yet not fall so light is vanity
juliet good even to my ghostly confessor
friar laurence romeo shall thank thee daughter for us both
juliet as much to him else is his thanks too much
romeo ah juliet if the measure of thy joy
 be heap'd like mine and that thy skill be more
 to blazon it then sweeten with thy breath
 this neighbour air and let rich music's tongue
 unfold the imagined happiness that both
 receive in either by this dear encounter
juliet conceit more rich in matter than in words
 brags of his substance not of ornament
 they are but beggars that can count their worth
 but my true love is grown to such excess
 i cannot sum up sum of half my wealth
friar laurence come come with me and we will make short work
 for by your leaves you shall not stay alone
 till holy church incorporate two in one

 enter mercutio benvolio page and servants
benvolio i pray thee good mercutio let's retire
 the day is hot the capulets abroad
 and if we meet we shall not scape a brawl
 for now these hot days is the mad blood stirring
mercutio thou art like one of those fellows that when he
 enters the confines of a tavern claps me his sword
 upon the table and says god send me no need of
 thee and by the operation of the second cup draws
 it on the drawer when indeed there is no need
benvolio am i like such a fellow
mercutio come come thou art as hot a jack in thy mood as
 any in italy and as soon moved to be moody and as
 soon moody to be moved
