 i would have made them skip i am old now
 and these same crosses spoil me who are you
 mine eyes are not o the best i'll tell you straight
kent if fortune brag of two she loved and hated
 one of them we behold
king lear this is a dull sight are you not kent
kent the same
 your servant kent where is your servant caius
king lear he's a good fellow i can tell you that
 he'll strike and quickly too he's dead and rotten
kent no my good lord i am the very man
king lear i'll see that straight
kent that from your first of difference and decay
 have follow'd your sad steps
king lear you are welcome hither
kent nor no man else all's cheerless dark and deadly
 your eldest daughters have fordone them selves
 and desperately are dead
king lear ay so i think
albany he knows not what he says and vain it is
 that we present us to him
edgar very bootless
 enter a captain
captain edmund is dead my lord
albany that's but a trifle here
 you lords and noble friends know our intent
 what comfort to this great decay may come
 shall be applied for us we will resign
 during the life of this old majesty
 to him our absolute power
 to edgar and kent
 you to your rights
 with boot and such addition as your honours
 have more than merited all friends shall taste
 the wages of their virtue and all foes
 the cup of their deservings o see see
king lear and my poor fool is hang'd no no no life
 why should a dog a horse a rat have life
 and thou no breath at all thou'lt come no more
 never never never never never
 pray you undo this button thank you sir
 do you see this look on her look her lips
 look there look there
 dies
edgar he faints my lord my lord
kent break heart i prithee break
edgar look up my lord
kent vex not his ghost o let him pass he hates him much
 that would upon the rack of this tough world
 stretch him out longer
edgar he is gone indeed
kent the wonder is he hath endured so long
 he but usurp'd his life
albany bear them from hence our present business
 is general woe
 to kent and edgar
 friends of my soul you twain
 rule in this realm and the gored state sustain
kent i have a journey sir shortly to go
 my master calls me i must not say no
albany the weight of this sad time we must obey
 speak what we feel not what we ought to say
 the oldest hath borne most we that are young
 shall never see so much nor live so long

act i
scene ii a camp near forres
 alarum within enter duncan malcolm donalbain
 lennox with attendants meeting a bleeding sergeant
duncan what bloody man is that he can report
 as seemeth by his plight of the revolt
 the newest state
malcolm this is the sergeant
 who like a good and hardy soldier fought
 gainst my captivity hail brave friend
 say to the king the knowledge of the broil
 as thou didst leave it
sergeant doubtful it stood
 as two spent swimmers that do cling together
 and choke their art the merciless macdonwald
 worthy to be a rebel for to that
 the multiplying villanies of nature
 do swarm upon himfrom the western isles
 of kerns and gallowglasses is supplied
 and fortune on his damned quarrel smiling
 show'd like a rebel's whore but all's too weak
 for brave macbethwell he deserves that name
 disdaining fortune with his brandish'd steel
 which smoked with bloody execution
 like valour's minion carved out his passage
 till he faced the slave
 which ne'er shook hands nor bade farewell to him
 till he unseam'd him from the nave to the chaps
 and fix'd his head upon our battlements
duncan o valiant cousin worthy gentleman
sergeant as whence the sun gins his reflection
 shipwrecking storms and direful thunders break
 so from that spring whence comfort seem'd to come
 discomfort swells mark king of scotland mark
 no sooner justice had with valour arm'd
 compell'd these skipping kerns to trust their heels
 but the norweyan lord surveying vantage
 with furbish'd arms and new supplies of men
 began a fresh assault
duncan dismay'd not this
 our captains macbeth and banquo
sergeant yes
 as sparrows eagles or the hare the lion
 if i say sooth i must report they were
 as cannons overcharged with double cracks so they
 doubly redoubled strokes upon the foe
 except they meant to bathe in reeking wounds
 or memorise another golgotha
 i cannot tell
 but i am faint my gashes cry for help
duncan so well thy words become thee as thy wounds
 they smack of honour both go get him surgeons
 exit sergeant attended
 who comes here
 enter ross
malcolm the worthy thane of ross
lennox what a haste looks through his eyes so should he look
 that seems to speak things strange
ross god save the king
duncan whence camest thou worthy thane
ross from fife great king
 where the norweyan banners flout the sky
 and fan our people cold norway himself
 with terrible numbers
 assisted by that most disloyal traitor
