 advanced above pale envy's threatening reach
 as when the golden sun salutes the morn
 and having gilt the ocean with his beams
 gallops the zodiac in his glistering coach
 and overlooks the highestpeering hills
 so tamora
 upon her wit doth earthly honour wait
 and virtue stoops and trembles at her frown
 then aaron arm thy heart and fit thy thoughts
 to mount aloft with thy imperial mistress
 and mount her pitch whom thou in triumph long
 hast prisoner held fetter'd in amorous chains
 and faster bound to aaron's charming eyes
 than is prometheus tied to caucasus
 away with slavish weeds and servile thoughts
 i will be bright and shine in pearl and gold
 to wait upon this newmade empress
 to wait said i to wanton with this queen
 this goddess this semiramis this nymph
 this siren that will charm rome's saturnine
 and see his shipwreck and his commonweal's
 holloa what storm is this
 enter demetrius and chiron braving
demetrius chiron thy years want wit thy wit wants edge
 and manners to intrude where i am graced
 and may for aught thou know'st affected be
chiron demetrius thou dost overween in all
 and so in this to bear me down with braves
 tis not the difference of a year or two
 makes me less gracious or thee more fortunate
 i am as able and as fit as thou
 to serve and to deserve my mistress grace
 and that my sword upon thee shall approve
 and plead my passions for lavinia's love
aaron aside clubs clubs these lovers will not keep
 the peace
demetrius why boy although our mother unadvised
 gave you a dancingrapier by your side
 are you so desperate grown to threat your friends
 go to have your lath glued within your sheath
 till you know better how to handle it
chiron meanwhile sir with the little skill i have
 full well shalt thou perceive how much i dare
demetrius ay boy grow ye so brave
 they draw
aaron coming forward why how now lords
 so near the emperor's palace dare you draw
 and maintain such a quarrel openly
 full well i wot the ground of all this grudge
 i would not for a million of gold
 the cause were known to them it most concerns
 nor would your noble mother for much more
 be so dishonour'd in the court of rome
 for shame put up
demetrius not i till i have sheathed
 my rapier in his bosom and withal
 thrust these reproachful speeches down his throat
 that he hath breathed in my dishonour here
chiron for that i am prepared and full resolved
 foulspoken coward that thunder'st with thy tongue
 and with thy weapon nothing darest perform
aaron away i say
 now by the gods that warlike goths adore
 this petty brabble will undo us all
 why lords and think you not how dangerous
 it is to jet upon a prince's right
 what is lavinia then become so loose
 or bassianus so degenerate
 that for her love such quarrels may be broach'd
 without controlment justice or revenge
 young lords beware and should the empress know
 this discord's ground the music would not please
chiron i care not i knew she and all the world
 i love lavinia more than all the world
demetrius youngling learn thou to make some meaner choice
 lavinia is thine elder brother's hope
aaron why are ye mad or know ye not in rome
 how furious and impatient they be
 and cannot brook competitors in love
 i tell you lords you do but plot your deaths
 by this device
chiron aaron a thousand deaths
 would i propose to achieve her whom i love
aaron to achieve her how
demetrius why makest thou it so strange
 she is a woman therefore may be woo'd
 she is a woman therefore may be won
 she is lavinia therefore must be loved
 what man more water glideth by the mill
 than wots the miller of and easy it is
 of a cut loaf to steal a shive we know
 though bassianus be the emperor's brother
 better than he have worn vulcan's badge
aaron aside ay and as good as saturninus may
demetrius then why should he despair that knows to court it
 with words fair looks and liberality
 what hast not thou full often struck a doe
 and borne her cleanly by the keeper's nose
aaron why then it seems some certain snatch or so
 would serve your turns
chiron ay so the turn were served
demetrius aaron thou hast hit it
aaron would you had hit it too
 then should not we be tired with this ado
 why hark ye hark ye and are you such fools
 to square for this would it offend you then
 that both should speed
chiron faith not me
demetrius nor me so i were one
aaron for shame be friends and join for that you jar
 tis policy and stratagem must do
 that you affect and so must you resolve
 that what you cannot as you would achieve
 you must perforce accomplish as you may
 take this of me lucrece was not more chaste
 than this lavinia bassianus love
 a speedier course than lingering languishment
 must we pursue and i have found the path
 my lords a solemn hunting is in hand
 there will the lovely roman ladies troop
 the forest walks are wide and spacious
 and many unfrequented plots there are
 fitted by kind for rape and villany
 single you thither then this dainty doe
 and strike her home by force if not by words
 this way or not at all stand you in hope
 come come our empress with her sacred wit
 to villany and vengeance consecrate
 will we acquaint with all that we intend
 and she shall file our engines with advice
 that will not suffer you to square yourselves
 but to your wishes height advance you both
 the emperor's court is like the house of fame
 the palace full of tongues of eyes and ears
 the woods are ruthless dreadful deaf and dull
 there speak and strike brave boys and take
 your turns
 there serve your lusts shadow'd from heaven's eye
 and revel in lavinia's treasury
chiron thy counsel lad smells of no cowardice
demetrius sit fas aut nefas till i find the stream
 to cool this heat a charm to calm these fits

act ii
scene ii a forest near rome horns and cry of hounds heard
 enter titus andronicus with hunters &c marcus
 lucius quintus and martius
titus andronicus the hunt is up the morn is bright and grey
 the fields are fragrant and the woods are green
 uncouple here and let us make a bay
 and wake the emperor and his lovely bride
 and rouse the prince and ring a hunter's peal
 that all the court may echo with the noise
 sons let it be your charge as it is ours
 to attend the emperor's person carefully
 i have been troubled in my sleep this night
 but dawning day new comfort hath inspired
 a cry of hounds and horns winded in a peal enter
 saturninus tamora bassianus lavinia demetrius
 chiron and attendants
 many good morrows to your majesty
 madam to you as many and as good
 i promised your grace a hunter's peal
saturninus and you have rung it lustily my lord
 somewhat too early for newmarried ladies
bassianus lavinia how say you
lavinia i say no
 i have been broad awake two hours and more
saturninus come on then horse and chariots let us have
 and to our sport
 to tamora
 madam now shall ye see
 our roman hunting
marcus andronicus i have dogs my lord
 will rouse the proudest panther in the chase
 and climb the highest promontory top
titus andronicus and i have horse will follow where the game
 makes way and run like swallows o'er the plain
demetrius chiron we hunt not we with horse nor hound
 but hope to pluck a dainty doe to ground
 exeunt
 titus andronicus
act ii
scene iii a lonely part of the forest
 enter aaron with a bag of gold
aaron he that had wit would think that i had none
 to bury so much gold under a tree
 and never after to inherit it
 let him that thinks of me so abjectly
 know that this gold must coin a stratagem
 which cunningly effected will beget
 a very excellent piece of villany
 and so repose sweet gold for their unrest
 hides the gold
 that have their alms out of the empress chest
 enter tamora
tamora my lovely aaron wherefore look'st thou sad
 when every thing doth make a gleeful boast
