 retiring from the siege of orleans
 having full scarce six thousand in his troop
 by three and twenty thousand of the french
 was round encompassed and set upon
 no leisure had he to enrank his men
 he wanted pikes to set before his archers
 instead whereof sharp stakes pluck'd out of hedges
 they pitched in the ground confusedly
 to keep the horsemen off from breaking in
 more than three hours the fight continued
 where valiant talbot above human thought
 enacted wonders with his sword and lance
 hundreds he sent to hell and none durst stand him
 here there and every where enraged he flew
 the french exclaim'd the devil was in arms
 all the whole army stood agazed on him
 his soldiers spying his undaunted spirit
 a talbot a talbot cried out amain
 and rush'd into the bowels of the battle
 here had the conquest fully been seal'd up
 if sir john fastolfe had not play'd the coward
 he being in the vaward placed behind
 with purpose to relieve and follow them
 cowardly fled not having struck one stroke
 hence grew the general wreck and massacre
 enclosed were they with their enemies
 a base walloon to win the dauphin's grace
 thrust talbot with a spear into the back
 whom all france with their chief assembled strength
 durst not presume to look once in the face
bedford is talbot slain then i will slay myself
 for living idly here in pomp and ease
 whilst such a worthy leader wanting aid
 unto his dastard foemen is betray'd
messenger o no he lives but is took prisoner
 and lord scales with him and lord hungerford
 most of the rest slaughter'd or took likewise
bedford his ransom there is none but i shall pay
 i'll hale the dauphin headlong from his throne
 his crown shall be the ransom of my friend
 four of their lords i'll change for one of ours
 farewell my masters to my task will i
 bonfires in france forthwith i am to make
 to keep our great saint george's feast withal
 ten thousand soldiers with me i will take
 whose bloody deeds shall make all europe quake
messenger so you had need for orleans is besieged
 the english army is grown weak and faint
 the earl of salisbury craveth supply
 and hardly keeps his men from mutiny
 since they so few watch such a multitude
exeter remember lords your oaths to henry sworn
 either to quell the dauphin utterly
 or bring him in obedience to your yoke
bedford i do remember it and here take my leave
 to go about my preparation
 exit
gloucester i'll to the tower with all the haste i can
 to view the artillery and munition
 and then i will proclaim young henry king
 exit
exeter to eltham will i where the young king is
 being ordain'd his special governor
 and for his safety there i'll best devise
 exit
bishop
of winchester each hath his place and function to attend
 i am left out for me nothing remains
 but long i will not be jack out of office
 the king from eltham i intend to steal
 and sit at chiefest stern of public weal
 exeunt
 1 king henry vi
act i
scene ii france before orleans
 sound a flourish enter charles alencon and
 reignier marching with drum and soldiers
charles mars his true moving even as in the heavens
 so in the earth to this day is not known
 late did he shine upon the english side
 now we are victors upon us he smiles
 what towns of any moment but we have
 at pleasure here we lie near orleans
 otherwhiles the famish'd english like pale ghosts
 faintly besiege us one hour in a month
alencon they want their porridge and their fat bullbeeves
 either they must be dieted like mules
 and have their provender tied to their mouths
 or piteous they will look like drowned mice
reignier let's raise the siege why live we idly here
 talbot is taken whom we wont to fear
 remaineth none but madbrain'd salisbury
 and he may well in fretting spend his gall
 nor men nor money hath he to make war
charles sound sound alarum we will rush on them
 now for the honour of the forlorn french
 him i forgive my death that killeth me
 when he sees me go back one foot or fly
 exeunt
 here alarum they are beaten back by the english
 with great loss reenter charles alencon and reignier
charles who ever saw the like what men have i
 dogs cowards dastards i would ne'er have fled
 but that they left me midst my enemies
reignier salisbury is a desperate homicide
 he fighteth as one weary of his life
 the other lords like lions wanting food
 do rush upon us as their hungry prey
alencon froissart a countryman of ours records
 england all olivers and rowlands bred
 during the time edward the third did reign
 more truly now may this be verified
 for none but samsons and goliases
 it sendeth forth to skirmish one to ten
 lean rawboned rascals who would e'er suppose
 they had such courage and audacity
charles let's leave this town for they are harebrain'd slaves
 and hunger will enforce them to be more eager
 of old i know them rather with their teeth
 the walls they'll tear down than forsake the siege
reignier i think by some odd gimmors or device
 their arms are set like clocks stiff to strike on
 else ne'er could they hold out so as they do
 by my consent we'll even let them alone
alencon be it so
 enter the bastard of orleans
bastard of orleans where's the prince dauphin i have news for him
charles bastard of orleans thrice welcome to us
bastard of orleans methinks your looks are sad your cheer appall'd
 hath the late overthrow wrought this offence
 be not dismay'd for succor is at hand
 a holy maid hither with me i bring
 which by a vision sent to her from heaven
 ordained is to raise this tedious siege
 and drive the english forth the bounds of france
 the spirit of deep prophecy she hath
 exceeding the nine sibyls of old rome
 what's past and what's to come she can descry
 speak shall i call her in believe my words
 for they are certain and unfallible
charles go call her in
 exit bastard of orleans
 but first to try her skill
 reignier stand thou as dauphin in my place
 question her proudly let thy looks be stern
 by this means shall we sound what skill she hath
 reenter the bastard of orleans with joan la pucelle
reignier fair maid is't thou wilt do these wondrous feats
joan la pucelle reignier is't thou that thinkest to beguile me
 where is the dauphin come come from behind
 i know thee well though never seen before
 be not amazed there's nothing hid from me
 in private will i talk with thee apart
 stand back you lords and give us leave awhile
reignier she takes upon her bravely at first dash
joan la pucelle dauphin i am by birth a shepherd's daughter
 my wit untrain'd in any kind of art
 heaven and our lady gracious hath it pleased
 to shine on my contemptible estate
 lo whilst i waited on my tender lambs
 and to sun's parching heat display'd my cheeks
 god's mother deigned to appear to me
 and in a vision full of majesty
 will'd me to leave my base vocation
 and free my country from calamity
 her aid she promised and assured success
 in complete glory she reveal'd herself
 and whereas i was black and swart before
 with those clear rays which she infused on me
 that beauty am i bless'd with which you see
 ask me what question thou canst possible
 and i will answer unpremeditated
 my courage try by combat if thou darest
 and thou shalt find that i exceed my sex
 resolve on this thou shalt be fortunate
 if thou receive me for thy warlike mate
charles thou hast astonish'd me with thy high terms
 only this proof i'll of thy valour make
 in single combat thou shalt buckle with me
 and if thou vanquishest thy words are true
 otherwise i renounce all confidence
joan la pucelle i am prepared here is my keenedged sword
 deck'd with five flowerdeluces on each side
 the which at touraine in saint katharine's
 churchyard
 out of a great deal of old iron i chose forth
charles then come o god's name i fear no woman
joan la pucelle and while i live i'll ne'er fly from a man
 here they fight and joan la pucelle overcomes
charles stay stay thy hands thou art an amazon
 and fightest with the sword of deborah
joan la pucelle christ's mother helps me else i were too weak
charles whoe'er helps thee tis thou that must help me
 impatiently i burn with thy desire
 my heart and hands thou hast at once subdued
 excellent pucelle if thy name be so
 let me thy servant and not sovereign be
 tis the french dauphin sueth to thee thus
joan la pucelle i must not yield to any rites of love
 for my profession's sacred from above
