 my great profaneness gainst thine oracle
 i'll reconcile me to polixenes
 new woo my queen recall the good camillo
 whom i proclaim a man of truth of mercy
 for being transported by my jealousies
 to bloody thoughts and to revenge i chose
 camillo for the minister to poison
 my friend polixenes which had been done
 but that the good mind of camillo tardied
 my swift command though i with death and with
 reward did threaten and encourage him
 not doing t and being done he most humane
 and fill'd with honour to my kingly guest
 unclasp'd my practise quit his fortunes here
 which you knew great and to the hazard
 of all encertainties himself commended
 no richer than his honour how he glisters
 thorough my rust and how his pity
 does my deeds make the blacker
 reenter paulina
paulina woe the while
 o cut my lace lest my heart cracking it
 break too
first lord what fit is this good lady
paulina what studied torments tyrant hast for me
 what wheels racks fires what flaying boiling
 in leads or oils what old or newer torture
 must i receive whose every word deserves
 to taste of thy most worst thy tyranny
 together working with thy jealousies
 fancies too weak for boys too green and idle
 for girls of nine o think what they have done
 and then run mad indeed stark mad for all
 thy bygone fooleries were but spices of it
 that thou betray'dst polixenes'twas nothing
 that did but show thee of a fool inconstant
 and damnable ingrateful nor was't much
 thou wouldst have poison'd good camillo's honour
 to have him kill a king poor trespasses
 more monstrous standing by whereof i reckon
 the casting forth to crows thy babydaughter
 to be or none or little though a devil
 would have shed water out of fire ere done't
 nor is't directly laid to thee the death
 of the young prince whose honourable thoughts
 thoughts high for one so tender cleft the heart
 that could conceive a gross and foolish sire
 blemish'd his gracious dam this is not no
 laid to thy answer but the lasto lords
 when i have said cry woe the queen the queen
 the sweet'st dear'st creature's dead
 and vengeance for't
 not dropp'd down yet
first lord the higher powers forbid
paulina i say she's dead i'll swear't if word nor oath
 prevail not go and see if you can bring
 tincture or lustre in her lip her eye
 heat outwardly or breath within i'll serve you
 as i would do the gods but o thou tyrant
 do not repent these things for they are heavier
 than all thy woes can stir therefore betake thee
 to nothing but despair a thousand knees
 ten thousand years together naked fasting
 upon a barren mountain and still winter
 in storm perpetual could not move the gods
 to look that way thou wert
leontes go on go on
 thou canst not speak too much i have deserved
 all tongues to talk their bitterest
first lord say no more
 howe'er the business goes you have made fault
 i the boldness of your speech
paulina i am sorry for't
 all faults i make when i shall come to know them
 i do repent alas i have show'd too much
 the rashness of a woman he is touch'd
 to the noble heart what's gone and what's past help
 should be past grief do not receive affliction
 at my petition i beseech you rather
 let me be punish'd that have minded you
 of what you should forget now good my liege
 sir royal sir forgive a foolish woman
 the love i bore your queenlo fool again
 i'll speak of her no more nor of your children
 i'll not remember you of my own lord
 who is lost too take your patience to you
 and i'll say nothing
leontes thou didst speak but well
 when most the truth which i receive much better
 than to be pitied of thee prithee bring me
 to the dead bodies of my queen and son
 one grave shall be for both upon them shall
 the causes of their death appear unto
 our shame perpetual once a day i'll visit
 the chapel where they lie and tears shed there
 shall be my recreation so long as nature
 will bear up with this exercise so long
 i daily vow to use it come and lead me
 unto these sorrows
 exeunt
 the winter's tale
act iii
scene iii bohemia a desert country near the sea
 enter antigonus with a child and a mariner
antigonus thou art perfect then our ship hath touch'd upon
 the deserts of bohemia
mariner ay my lord and fear
 we have landed in ill time the skies look grimly
 and threaten present blusters in my conscience
 the heavens with that we have in hand are angry
 and frown upon s
antigonus their sacred wills be done go get aboard
 look to thy bark i'll not be long before
 i call upon thee
mariner make your best haste and go not
 too far i the land tis like to be loud weather
 besides this place is famous for the creatures
 of prey that keep upon't
antigonus go thou away
 i'll follow instantly
mariner i am glad at heart
 to be so rid o the business
 exit
antigonus come poor babe
 i have heard but not believed
 the spirits o the dead
 may walk again if such thing be thy mother
 appear'd to me last night for ne'er was dream
 so like a waking to me comes a creature
 sometimes her head on one side some another
 i never saw a vessel of like sorrow
 so fill'd and so becoming in pure white robes
 like very sanctity she did approach
 my cabin where i lay thrice bow'd before me
 and gasping to begin some speech her eyes
 became two spouts the fury spent anon
 did this breakfrom her good antigonus
 since fate against thy better disposition
 hath made thy person for the throwerout
 of my poor babe according to thine oath
 places remote enough are in bohemia
 there weep and leave it crying and for the babe
 is counted lost for ever perdita
 i prithee call't for this ungentle business
 put on thee by my lord thou ne'er shalt see
 thy wife paulina more and so with shrieks
 she melted into air affrighted much
 i did in time collect myself and thought
 this was so and no slumber dreams are toys
 yet for this once yea superstitiously
 i will be squared by this i do believe
 hermione hath suffer'd death and that
 apollo would this being indeed the issue
 of king polixenes it should here be laid
 either for life or death upon the earth
 of its right father blossom speed thee well
 there lie and there thy character there these
 which may if fortune please both breed thee pretty
 and still rest thine the storm begins poor wretch
 that for thy mother's fault art thus exposed
 to loss and what may follow weep i cannot
 but my heart bleeds and most accursed am i
 to be by oath enjoin'd to this farewell
 the day frowns more and more thou'rt like to have
 a lullaby too rough i never saw
 the heavens so dim by day a savage clamour
 well may i get aboard this is the chase
 i am gone for ever
 exit pursued by a bear
 enter a shepherd

 threeandtwenty or that youth would sleep out the
