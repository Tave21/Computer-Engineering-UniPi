neither have we obeyed the voice of the lord our god to walk in his laws which he set before us by his servants the prophets
yea all israel have transgressed thy law even by departing that they might not obey thy voice therefore the curse is poured upon us and the oath that is written in the law of moses the servant of god because we have sinned against him
and he hath confirmed his words which he spake against us and against our judges that judged us by bringing upon us a great evil for under the whole heaven hath not been done as hath been done upon jerusalem
as it is written in the law of moses all this evil is come upon us yet made we not our prayer before the lord our god that we might turn from our iniquities and understand thy truth
therefore hath the lord watched upon the evil and brought it upon us for the lord our god is righteous in all his works which he doeth for we obeyed not his voice
and now o lord our god that hast brought thy people forth out of the land of egypt with a mighty hand and hast gotten thee renown as at this day we have sinned we have done wickedly
o lord according to all thy righteousness i beseech thee let thine anger and thy fury be turned away from thy city jerusalem thy holy mountain because for our sins and for the iniquities of our fathers jerusalem and thy people are become a reproach to all that are about us
now therefore o our god hear the prayer of thy servant and his supplications and cause thy face to shine upon thy sanctuary that is desolate for the lord's sake
o my god incline thine ear and hear open thine eyes and behold our desolations and the city which is called by thy name for we do not present our supplications before thee for our righteousnesses but for thy great mercies
o lord hear o lord forgive o lord hearken and do defer not for thine own sake o my god for thy city and thy people are called by thy name
and whiles i was speaking and praying and confessing my sin and the sin of my people israel and presenting my supplication before the lord my god for the holy mountain of my god
yea whiles i was speaking in prayer even the man gabriel whom i had seen in the vision at the beginning being caused to fly swiftly touched me about the time of the evening oblation
and he informed me and talked with me and said o daniel i am now come forth to give thee skill and understanding
at the beginning of thy supplications the commandment came forth and i am come to shew thee for thou art greatly beloved therefore understand the matter and consider the vision
seventy weeks are determined upon thy people and upon thy holy city to finish the transgression and to make an end of sins and to make reconciliation for iniquity and to bring in everlasting righteousness and to seal up the vision and prophecy and to anoint the most holy
know therefore and understand that from the going forth of the commandment to restore and to build jerusalem unto the messiah the prince shall be seven weeks and threescore and two weeks the street shall be built again and the wall even in troublous times
and after threescore and two weeks shall messiah be cut off but not for himself and the people of the prince that shall come shall destroy the city and the sanctuary and the end thereof shall be with a flood and unto the end of the war desolations are determined
and he shall confirm the covenant with many for one week and in the midst of the week he shall cause the sacrifice and the oblation to cease and for the overspreading of abominations he shall make it desolate even until the consummation and that determined shall be poured upon the desolate
in the third year of cyrus king of persia a thing was revealed unto daniel whose name was called belteshazzar and the thing was true but the time appointed was long and he understood the thing and had understanding of the vision
in those days i daniel was mourning three full weeks
i ate no pleasant bread neither came flesh nor wine in my mouth neither did i anoint myself at all till three whole weeks were fulfilled
and in the four and twentieth day of the first month as i was by the side of the great river which is hiddekel
then i lifted up mine eyes and looked and behold a certain man clothed in linen whose loins were girded with fine gold of uphaz
his body also was like the beryl and his face as the appearance of lightning and his eyes as lamps of fire and his arms and his feet like in colour to polished brass and the voice of his words like the voice of a multitude
and i daniel alone saw the vision for the men that were with me saw not the vision but a great quaking fell upon them so that they fled to hide themselves
therefore i was left alone and saw this great vision and there remained no strength in me for my comeliness was turned in me into corruption and i retained no strength
yet heard i the voice of his words and when i heard the voice of his words then was i in a deep sleep on my face and my face toward the ground
and behold an hand touched me which set me upon my knees and upon the palms of my hands
and he said unto me o daniel a man greatly beloved understand the words that i speak unto thee and stand upright for unto thee am i now sent and when he had spoken this word unto me i stood trembling
then said he unto me fear not daniel for from the first day that thou didst set thine heart to understand and to chasten thyself before thy god thy words were heard and i am come for thy words
but the prince of the kingdom of persia withstood me one and twenty days but lo michael one of the chief princes came to help me and i remained there with the kings of persia
now i am come to make thee understand what shall befall thy people in the latter days for yet the vision is for many days
and when he had spoken such words unto me i set my face toward the ground and i became dumb
and behold one like the similitude of the sons of men touched my lips then i opened my mouth and spake and said unto him that stood before me o my lord by the vision my sorrows are turned upon me and i have retained no strength
for how can the servant of this my lord talk with this my lord for as for me straightway there remained no strength in me neither is there breath left in me
then there came again and touched me one like the appearance of a man and he strengthened me
and said o man greatly beloved fear not peace be unto thee be strong yea be strong and when he had spoken unto me i was strengthened and said let my lord speak for thou hast strengthened me
then said he knowest thou wherefore i come unto thee and now will i return to fight with the prince of persia and when i am gone forth lo the prince of grecia shall come
but i will shew thee that which is noted in the scripture of truth and there is none that holdeth with me in these things but michael your prince
also i in the first year of darius the mede even i stood to confirm and to strengthen him
and now will i shew thee the truth behold there shall stand up yet three kings in persia and the fourth shall be far richer than they all and by his strength through his riches he shall stir up all against the realm of grecia
and a mighty king shall stand up that shall rule with great dominion and do according to his will
and when he shall stand up his kingdom shall be broken and shall be divided toward the four winds of heaven and not to his posterity nor according to his dominion which he ruled for his kingdom shall be plucked up even for others beside those
and the king of the south shall be strong and one of his princes and he shall be strong above him and have dominion his dominion shall be a great dominion
and in the end of years they shall join themselves together for the king's daughter of the south shall come to the king of the north to make an agreement but she shall not retain the power of the arm neither shall he stand nor his arm but she shall be given up and they that brought her and he that begat her and he that strengthened her in these times
but out of a branch of her roots shall one stand up in his estate which shall come with an army and shall enter into the fortress of the king of the north and shall deal against them and shall prevail
and shall also carry captives into egypt their gods with their princes and with their precious vessels of silver and of gold and he shall continue more years than the king of the north
so the king of the south shall come into his kingdom and shall return into his own land
but his sons shall be stirred up and shall assemble a multitude of great forces and one shall certainly come and overflow and pass through then shall he return and be stirred up even to his fortress
and the king of the south shall be moved with choler and shall come forth and fight with him even with the king of the north and he shall set forth a great multitude but the multitude shall be given into his hand
and when he hath taken away the multitude his heart shall be lifted up and he shall cast down many ten thousands but he shall not be strengthened by it
for the king of the north shall return and shall set forth a multitude greater than the former and shall certainly come after certain years with a great army and with much riches
and in those times there shall many stand up against the king of the south also the robbers of thy people shall exalt themselves to establish the vision but they shall fall
so the king of the north shall come and cast up a mount and take the most fenced cities and the arms of the south shall not withstand neither his chosen people neither shall there be any strength to withstand
but he that cometh against him shall do according to his own will and none shall stand before him and he shall stand in the glorious land which by his hand shall be consumed
he shall also set his face to enter with the strength of his whole kingdom and upright ones with him thus shall he do and he shall give him the daughter of women corrupting her but she shall not stand on his side neither be for him
after this shall he turn his face unto the isles and shall take many but a prince for his own behalf shall cause the reproach offered by him to cease without his own reproach he shall cause it to turn upon him
then he shall turn his face toward the fort of his own land but he shall stumble and fall and not be found
then shall stand up in his estate a raiser of taxes in the glory of the kingdom but within few days he shall be destroyed neither in anger nor in battle
and in his estate shall stand up a vile person to whom they shall not give the honour of the kingdom but he shall come in peaceably and obtain the kingdom by flatteries
and with the arms of a flood shall they be overflown from before him and shall be broken yea also the prince of the covenant
and after the league made with him he shall work deceitfully for he shall come up and shall become strong with a small people
he shall enter peaceably even upon the fattest places of the province and he shall do that which his fathers have not done nor his fathers fathers he shall scatter among them the prey and spoil and riches yea and he shall forecast his devices against the strong holds even for a time
and he shall stir up his power and his courage against the king of the south with a great army and the king of the south shall be stirred up to battle with a very great and mighty army but he shall not stand for they shall forecast devices against him
yea they that feed of the portion of his meat shall destroy him and his army shall overflow and many shall fall down slain
and both these kings hearts shall be to do mischief and they shall speak lies at one table but it shall not prosper for yet the end shall be at the time appointed
then shall he return into his land with great riches and his heart shall be against the holy covenant and he shall do exploits and return to his own land
at the time appointed he shall return and come toward the south but it shall not be as the former or as the latter
for the ships of chittim shall come against him therefore he shall be grieved and return and have indignation against the holy covenant so shall he do he shall even return and have intelligence with them that forsake the holy covenant
and arms shall stand on his part and they shall pollute the sanctuary of strength and shall take away the daily sacrifice and they shall place the abomination that maketh desolate
and such as do wickedly against the covenant shall he corrupt by flatteries but the people that do know their god shall be strong and do exploits
and they that understand among the people shall instruct many yet they shall fall by the sword and by flame by captivity and by spoil many days
now when they shall fall they shall be holpen with a little help but many shall cleave to them with flatteries
and some of them of understanding shall fall to try them and to purge and to make them white even to the time of the end because it is yet for a time appointed
and the king shall do according to his will and he shall exalt himself and magnify himself above every god and shall speak marvellous things against the god of gods and shall prosper till the indignation be accomplished for that that is determined shall be done
neither shall he regard the god of his fathers nor the desire of women nor regard any god for he shall magnify himself above all
but in his estate shall he honour the god of forces and a god whom his fathers knew not shall he honour with gold and silver and with precious stones and pleasant things
thus shall he do in the most strong holds with a strange god whom he shall acknowledge and increase with glory and he shall cause them to rule over many and shall divide the land for gain
and at the time of the end shall the king of the south push at him and the king of the north shall come against him like a whirlwind with chariots and with horsemen and with many ships and he shall enter into the countries and shall overflow and pass over
he shall enter also into the glorious land and many countries shall be overthrown but these shall escape out of his hand even edom and moab and the chief of the children of ammon
he shall stretch forth his hand also upon the countries and the land of egypt shall not escape
but he shall have power over the treasures of gold and of silver and over all the precious things of egypt and the libyans and the ethiopians shall be at his steps
but tidings out of the east and out of the north shall trouble him therefore he shall go forth with great fury to destroy and utterly to make away many
and he shall plant the tabernacles of his palace between the seas in the glorious holy mountain yet he shall come to his end and none shall help him
and at that time shall michael stand up the great prince which standeth for the children of thy people and there shall be a time of trouble such as never was since there was a nation even to that same time and at that time thy people shall be delivered every one that shall be found written in the book
and many of them that sleep in the dust of the earth shall awake some to everlasting life and some to shame and everlasting contempt
and they that be wise shall shine as the brightness of the firmament and they that turn many to righteousness as the stars for ever and ever
but thou o daniel shut up the words and seal the book even to the time of the end many shall run to and fro and knowledge shall be increased
then i daniel looked and behold there stood other two the one on this side of the bank of the river and the other on that side of the bank of the river
and one said to the man clothed in linen which was upon the waters of the river how long shall it be to the end of these wonders
and i heard the man clothed in linen which was upon the waters of the river when he held up his right hand and his left hand unto heaven and sware by him that liveth for ever that it shall be for a time times and an half and when he shall have accomplished to scatter the power of the holy people all these things shall be finished
and i heard but i understood not then said i o my lord what shall be the end of these things
and he said go thy way daniel for the words are closed up and sealed till the time of the end
many shall be purified and made white and tried but the wicked shall do wickedly and none of the wicked shall understand but the wise shall understand
and from the time that the daily sacrifice shall be taken away and the abomination that maketh desolate set up there shall be a thousand two hundred and ninety days
blessed is he that waiteth and cometh to the thousand three hundred and five and thirty days
but go thou thy way till the end be for thou shalt rest and stand in thy lot at the end of the days
the word of the lord that came unto hosea the son of beeri in the days of uzziah jotham ahaz and hezekiah kings of judah and in the days of jeroboam the son of joash king of israel
the beginning of the word of the lord by hosea and the lord said to hosea go take unto thee a wife of whoredoms and children of whoredoms for the land hath committed great whoredom departing from the lord
so he went and took gomer the daughter of diblaim which conceived and bare him a son
and the lord said unto him call his name jezreel for yet a little while and i will avenge the blood of jezreel upon the house of jehu and will cause to cease the kingdom of the house of israel
and it shall come to pass at that day that i will break the bow of israel in the valley of jezreel
and she conceived again and bare a daughter and god said unto him call her name loruhamah for i will no more have mercy upon the house of israel but i will utterly take them away
but i will have mercy upon the house of judah and will save them by the lord their god and will not save them by bow nor by sword nor by battle by horses nor by horsemen
now when she had weaned loruhamah she conceived and bare a son
then said god call his name loammi for ye are not my people and i will not be your god
yet the number of the children of israel shall be as the sand of the sea which cannot be measured nor numbered and it shall come to pass that in the place where it was said unto them ye are not my people there it shall be said unto them ye are the sons of the living god
then shall the children of judah and the children of israel be gathered together and appoint themselves one head and they shall come up out of the land for great shall be the day of jezreel
say ye unto your brethren ammi and to your sisters ruhamah
plead with your mother plead for she is not my wife neither am i her husband let her therefore put away her whoredoms out of her sight and her adulteries from between her breasts
lest i strip her naked and set her as in the day that she was born and make her as a wilderness and set her like a dry land and slay her with thirst
and i will not have mercy upon her children for they be the children of whoredoms
for their mother hath played the harlot she that conceived them hath done shamefully for she said i will go after my lovers that give me my bread and my water my wool and my flax mine oil and my drink
therefore behold i will hedge up thy way with thorns and make a wall that she shall not find her paths
and she shall follow after her lovers but she shall not overtake them and she shall seek them but shall not find them then shall she say i will go and return to my first husband for then was it better with me than now
for she did not know that i gave her corn and wine and oil and multiplied her silver and gold which they prepared for baal
therefore will i return and take away my corn in the time thereof and my wine in the season thereof and will recover my wool and my flax given to cover her nakedness
and now will i discover her lewdness in the sight of her lovers and none shall deliver her out of mine hand
i will also cause all her mirth to cease her feast days her new moons and her sabbaths and all her solemn feasts
and i will destroy her vines and her fig trees whereof she hath said these are my rewards that my lovers have given me and i will make them a forest and the beasts of the field shall eat them
and i will visit upon her the days of baalim wherein she burned incense to them and she decked herself with her earrings and her jewels and she went after her lovers and forgat me saith the lord
therefore behold i will allure her and bring her into the wilderness and speak comfortably unto her
and i will give her her vineyards from thence and the valley of achor for a door of hope and she shall sing there as in the days of her youth and as in the day when she came up out of the land of egypt
and it shall be at that day saith the lord that thou shalt call me ishi and shalt call me no more baali
for i will take away the names of baalim out of her mouth and they shall no more be remembered by their name
and in that day will i make a covenant for them with the beasts of the field and with the fowls of heaven and with the creeping things of the ground and i will break the bow and the sword and the battle out of the earth and will make them to lie down safely
and i will betroth thee unto me for ever yea i will betroth thee unto me in righteousness and in judgment and in lovingkindness and in mercies
i will even betroth thee unto me in faithfulness and thou shalt know the lord
and it shall come to pass in that day i will hear saith the lord i will hear the heavens and they shall hear the earth
and the earth shall hear the corn and the wine and the oil and they shall hear jezreel
and i will sow her unto me in the earth and i will have mercy upon her that had not obtained mercy and i will say to them which were not my people thou art my people and they shall say thou art my god
then said the lord unto me go yet love a woman beloved of her friend yet an adulteress according to the love of the lord toward the children of israel who look to other gods and love flagons of wine
so i bought her to me for fifteen pieces of silver and for an homer of barley and an half homer of barley
and i said unto her thou shalt abide for me many days thou shalt not play the harlot and thou shalt not be for another man so will i also be for thee
for the children of israel shall abide many days without a king and without a prince and without a sacrifice and without an image and without an ephod and without teraphim
afterward shall the children of israel return and seek the lord their god and david their king and shall fear the lord and his goodness in the latter days
hear the word of the lord ye children of israel for the lord hath a controversy with the inhabitants of the land because there is no truth nor mercy nor knowledge of god in the land
by swearing and lying and killing and stealing and committing adultery they break out and blood toucheth blood
therefore shall the land mourn and every one that dwelleth therein shall languish with the beasts of the field and with the fowls of heaven yea the fishes of the sea also shall be taken away
yet let no man strive nor reprove another for thy people are as they that strive with the priest
therefore shalt thou fall in the day and the prophet also shall fall with thee in the night and i will destroy thy mother
my people are destroyed for lack of knowledge because thou hast rejected knowledge i will also reject thee that thou shalt be no priest to me seeing thou hast forgotten the law of thy god i will also forget thy children
as they were increased so they sinned against me therefore will i change their glory into shame
they eat up the sin of my people and they set their heart on their iniquity
and there shall be like people like priest and i will punish them for their ways and reward them their doings
for they shall eat and not have enough they shall commit whoredom and shall not increase because they have left off to take heed to the lord
whoredom and wine and new wine take away the heart
my people ask counsel at their stocks and their staff declareth unto them for the spirit of whoredoms hath caused them to err and they have gone a whoring from under their god
they sacrifice upon the tops of the mountains and burn incense upon the hills under oaks and poplars and elms because the shadow thereof is good therefore your daughters shall commit whoredom and your spouses shall commit adultery
i will not punish your daughters when they commit whoredom nor your spouses when they commit adultery for themselves are separated with whores and they sacrifice with harlots therefore the people that doth not understand shall fall
though thou israel play the harlot yet let not judah offend and come not ye unto gilgal neither go ye up to bethaven nor swear the lord liveth
for israel slideth back as a backsliding heifer now the lord will feed them as a lamb in a large place
ephraim is joined to idols let him alone
their drink is sour they have committed whoredom continually her rulers with shame do love give ye
the wind hath bound her up in her wings and they shall be ashamed because of their sacrifices
hear ye this o priests and hearken ye house of israel and give ye ear o house of the king for judgment is toward you because ye have been a snare on mizpah and a net spread upon tabor
and the revolters are profound to make slaughter though i have been a rebuker of them all
i know ephraim and israel is not hid from me for now o ephraim thou committest whoredom and israel is defiled
they will not frame their doings to turn unto their god for the spirit of whoredoms is in the midst of them and they have not known the lord
and the pride of israel doth testify to his face therefore shall israel and ephraim fall in their iniquity judah also shall fall with them
they shall go with their flocks and with their herds to seek the lord but they shall not find him he hath withdrawn himself from them
they have dealt treacherously against the lord for they have begotten strange children now shall a month devour them with their portions
blow ye the cornet in gibeah and the trumpet in ramah cry aloud at bethaven after thee o benjamin
ephraim shall be desolate in the day of rebuke among the tribes of israel have i made known that which shall surely be
the princes of judah were like them that remove the bound therefore i will pour out my wrath upon them like water
ephraim is oppressed and broken in judgment because he willingly walked after the commandment
therefore will i be unto ephraim as a moth and to the house of judah as rottenness
when ephraim saw his sickness and judah saw his wound then went ephraim to the assyrian and sent to king jareb yet could he not heal you nor cure you of your wound
for i will be unto ephraim as a lion and as a young lion to the house of judah i even i will tear and go away i will take away and none shall rescue him
i will go and return to my place till they acknowledge their offence and seek my face in their affliction they will seek me early
come and let us return unto the lord for he hath torn and he will heal us he hath smitten and he will bind us up
after two days will he revive us in the third day he will raise us up and we shall live in his sight
then shall we know if we follow on to know the lord his going forth is prepared as the morning and he shall come unto us as the rain as the latter and former rain unto the earth
o ephraim what shall i do unto thee o judah what shall i do unto thee for your goodness is as a morning cloud and as the early dew it goeth away
therefore have i hewed them by the prophets i have slain them by the words of my mouth and thy judgments are as the light that goeth forth
for i desired mercy and not sacrifice and the knowledge of god more than burnt offerings
but they like men have transgressed the covenant there have they dealt treacherously against me
gilead is a city of them that work iniquity and is polluted with blood
and as troops of robbers wait for a man so the company of priests murder in the way by consent for they commit lewdness
i have seen an horrible thing in the house of israel there is the whoredom of ephraim israel is defiled
also o judah he hath set an harvest for thee when i returned the captivity of my people
when i would have healed israel then the iniquity of ephraim was discovered and the wickedness of samaria for they commit falsehood and the thief cometh in and the troop of robbers spoileth without
and they consider not in their hearts that i remember all their wickedness now their own doings have beset them about they are before my face
they make the king glad with their wickedness and the princes with their lies
they are all adulterers as an oven heated by the baker who ceaseth from raising after he hath kneaded the dough until it be leavened
in the day of our king the princes have made him sick with bottles of wine he stretched out his hand with scorners
for they have made ready their heart like an oven whiles they lie in wait their baker sleepeth all the night in the morning it burneth as a flaming fire
they are all hot as an oven and have devoured their judges all their kings are fallen there is none among them that calleth unto me
ephraim he hath mixed himself among the people ephraim is a cake not turned
strangers have devoured his strength and he knoweth it not yea gray hairs are here and there upon him yet he knoweth not
and the pride of israel testifieth to his face and they do not return to the lord their god nor seek him for all this
ephraim also is like a silly dove without heart they call to egypt they go to assyria
when they shall go i will spread my net upon them i will bring them down as the fowls of the heaven i will chastise them as their congregation hath heard
woe unto them for they have fled from me destruction unto them because they have transgressed against me though i have redeemed them yet they have spoken lies against me
and they have not cried unto me with their heart when they howled upon their beds they assemble themselves for corn and wine and they rebel against me
though i have bound and strengthened their arms yet do they imagine mischief against me
they return but not to the most high they are like a deceitful bow their princes shall fall by the sword for the rage of their tongue this shall be their derision in the land of egypt
set the trumpet to thy mouth he shall come as an eagle against the house of the lord because they have transgressed my covenant and trespassed against my law
israel shall cry unto me my god we know thee
israel hath cast off the thing that is good the enemy shall pursue him
