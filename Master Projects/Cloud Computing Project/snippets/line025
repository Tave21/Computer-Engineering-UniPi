and i besought the lord at that time saying
o lord god thou hast begun to shew thy servant thy greatness and thy mighty hand for what god is there in heaven or in earth that can do according to thy works and according to thy might
i pray thee let me go over and see the good land that is beyond jordan that goodly mountain and lebanon
but the lord was wroth with me for your sakes and would not hear me and the lord said unto me let it suffice thee speak no more unto me of this matter
get thee up into the top of pisgah and lift up thine eyes westward and northward and southward and eastward and behold it with thine eyes for thou shalt not go over this jordan
but charge joshua and encourage him and strengthen him for he shall go over before this people and he shall cause them to inherit the land which thou shalt see
so we abode in the valley over against bethpeor
now therefore hearken o israel unto the statutes and unto the judgments which i teach you for to do them that ye may live and go in and possess the land which the lord god of your fathers giveth you
ye shall not add unto the word which i command you neither shall ye diminish ought from it that ye may keep the commandments of the lord your god which i command you
your eyes have seen what the lord did because of baalpeor for all the men that followed baalpeor the lord thy god hath destroyed them from among you
but ye that did cleave unto the lord your god are alive every one of you this day
behold i have taught you statutes and judgments even as the lord my god commanded me that ye should do so in the land whither ye go to possess it
keep therefore and do them for this is your wisdom and your understanding in the sight of the nations which shall hear all these statutes and say surely this great nation is a wise and understanding people
for what nation is there so great who hath god so nigh unto them as the lord our god is in all things that we call upon him for
and what nation is there so great that hath statutes and judgments so righteous as all this law which i set before you this day
only take heed to thyself and keep thy soul diligently lest thou forget the things which thine eyes have seen and lest they depart from thy heart all the days of thy life but teach them thy sons and thy sons sons
specially the day that thou stoodest before the lord thy god in horeb when the lord said unto me gather me the people together and i will make them hear my words that they may learn to fear me all the days that they shall live upon the earth and that they may teach their children
and ye came near and stood under the mountain and the mountain burned with fire unto the midst of heaven with darkness clouds and thick darkness
and the lord spake unto you out of the midst of the fire ye heard the voice of the words but saw no similitude only ye heard a voice
and he declared unto you his covenant which he commanded you to perform even ten commandments and he wrote them upon two tables of stone
and the lord commanded me at that time to teach you statutes and judgments that ye might do them in the land whither ye go over to possess it
take ye therefore good heed unto yourselves for ye saw no manner of similitude on the day that the lord spake unto you in horeb out of the midst of the fire
lest ye corrupt yourselves and make you a graven image the similitude of any figure the likeness of male or female
the likeness of any beast that is on the earth the likeness of any winged fowl that flieth in the air
the likeness of any thing that creepeth on the ground the likeness of any fish that is in the waters beneath the earth
and lest thou lift up thine eyes unto heaven and when thou seest the sun and the moon and the stars even all the host of heaven shouldest be driven to worship them and serve them which the lord thy god hath divided unto all nations under the whole heaven
but the lord hath taken you and brought you forth out of the iron furnace even out of egypt to be unto him a people of inheritance as ye are this day
furthermore the lord was angry with me for your sakes and sware that i should not go over jordan and that i should not go in unto that good land which the lord thy god giveth thee for an inheritance
but i must die in this land i must not go over jordan but ye shall go over and possess that good land
take heed unto yourselves lest ye forget the covenant of the lord your god which he made with you and make you a graven image or the likeness of any thing which the lord thy god hath forbidden thee
for the lord thy god is a consuming fire even a jealous god
when thou shalt beget children and children's children and ye shall have remained long in the land and shall corrupt yourselves and make a graven image or the likeness of any thing and shall do evil in the sight of the lord thy god to provoke him to anger
i call heaven and earth to witness against you this day that ye shall soon utterly perish from off the land whereunto ye go over jordan to possess it ye shall not prolong your days upon it but shall utterly be destroyed
and the lord shall scatter you among the nations and ye shall be left few in number among the heathen whither the lord shall lead you
and there ye shall serve gods the work of men's hands wood and stone which neither see nor hear nor eat nor smell
but if from thence thou shalt seek the lord thy god thou shalt find him if thou seek him with all thy heart and with all thy soul
when thou art in tribulation and all these things are come upon thee even in the latter days if thou turn to the lord thy god and shalt be obedient unto his voice
for the lord thy god is a merciful god he will not forsake thee neither destroy thee nor forget the covenant of thy fathers which he sware unto them
for ask now of the days that are past which were before thee since the day that god created man upon the earth and ask from the one side of heaven unto the other whether there hath been any such thing as this great thing is or hath been heard like it
did ever people hear the voice of god speaking out of the midst of the fire as thou hast heard and live
or hath god assayed to go and take him a nation from the midst of another nation by temptations by signs and by wonders and by war and by a mighty hand and by a stretched out arm and by great terrors according to all that the lord your god did for you in egypt before your eyes
unto thee it was shewed that thou mightest know that the lord he is god there is none else beside him
out of heaven he made thee to hear his voice that he might instruct thee and upon earth he shewed thee his great fire and thou heardest his words out of the midst of the fire
and because he loved thy fathers therefore he chose their seed after them and brought thee out in his sight with his mighty power out of egypt
to drive out nations from before thee greater and mightier than thou art to bring thee in to give thee their land for an inheritance as it is this day
know therefore this day and consider it in thine heart that the lord he is god in heaven above and upon the earth beneath there is none else
thou shalt keep therefore his statutes and his commandments which i command thee this day that it may go well with thee and with thy children after thee and that thou mayest prolong thy days upon the earth which the lord thy god giveth thee for ever
then moses severed three cities on this side jordan toward the sunrising
that the slayer might flee thither which should kill his neighbour unawares and hated him not in times past and that fleeing unto one of these cities he might live
namely bezer in the wilderness in the plain country of the reubenites and ramoth in gilead of the gadites and golan in bashan of the manassites
and this is the law which moses set before the children of israel
these are the testimonies and the statutes and the judgments which moses spake unto the children of israel after they came forth out of egypt
on this side jordan in the valley over against bethpeor in the land of sihon king of the amorites who dwelt at heshbon whom moses and the children of israel smote after they were come forth out of egypt
and they possessed his land and the land of og king of bashan two kings of the amorites which were on this side jordan toward the sunrising
from aroer which is by the bank of the river arnon even unto mount sion which is hermon
and all the plain on this side jordan eastward even unto the sea of the plain under the springs of pisgah
and moses called all israel and said unto them hear o israel the statutes and judgments which i speak in your ears this day that ye may learn them and keep and do them
the lord our god made a covenant with us in horeb
the lord made not this covenant with our fathers but with us even us who are all of us here alive this day
the lord talked with you face to face in the mount out of the midst of the fire
i stood between the lord and you at that time to shew you the word of the lord for ye were afraid by reason of the fire and went not up into the mount saying
i am the lord thy god which brought thee out of the land of egypt from the house of bondage
thou shalt have none other gods before me
thou shalt not make thee any graven image or any likeness of any thing that is in heaven above or that is in the earth beneath or that is in the waters beneath the earth
thou shalt not bow down thyself unto them nor serve them for i the lord thy god am a jealous god visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children unto the third and fourth generation of them that hate me
and shewing mercy unto thousands of them that love me and keep my commandments
thou shalt not take the name of the lord thy god in vain for the lord will not hold him guiltless that taketh his name in vain
keep the sabbath day to sanctify it as the lord thy god hath commanded thee
six days thou shalt labour and do all thy work
but the seventh day is the sabbath of the lord thy god in it thou shalt not do any work thou nor thy son nor thy daughter nor thy manservant nor thy maidservant nor thine ox nor thine ass nor any of thy cattle nor thy stranger that is within thy gates that thy manservant and thy maidservant may rest as well as thou
and remember that thou wast a servant in the land of egypt and that the lord thy god brought thee out thence through a mighty hand and by a stretched out arm therefore the lord thy god commanded thee to keep the sabbath day
honour thy father and thy mother as the lord thy god hath commanded thee that thy days may be prolonged and that it may go well with thee in the land which the lord thy god giveth thee
thou shalt not kill
neither shalt thou commit adultery
neither shalt thou steal
neither shalt thou bear false witness against thy neighbour
neither shalt thou desire thy neighbour's wife neither shalt thou covet thy neighbour's house his field or his manservant or his maidservant his ox or his ass or any thing that is thy neighbour's
these words the lord spake unto all your assembly in the mount out of the midst of the fire of the cloud and of the thick darkness with a great voice and he added no more and he wrote them in two tables of stone and delivered them unto me
and it came to pass when ye heard the voice out of the midst of the darkness for the mountain did burn with fire that ye came near unto me even all the heads of your tribes and your elders
and ye said behold the lord our god hath shewed us his glory and his greatness and we have heard his voice out of the midst of the fire we have seen this day that god doth talk with man and he liveth
now therefore why should we die for this great fire will consume us if we hear the voice of the lord our god any more then we shall die
for who is there of all flesh that hath heard the voice of the living god speaking out of the midst of the fire as we have and lived
go thou near and hear all that the lord our god shall say and speak thou unto us all that the lord our god shall speak unto thee and we will hear it and do it
and the lord heard the voice of your words when ye spake unto me and the lord said unto me i have heard the voice of the words of this people which they have spoken unto thee they have well said all that they have spoken
o that there were such an heart in them that they would fear me and keep all my commandments always that it might be well with them and with their children for ever
go say to them get you into your tents again
but as for thee stand thou here by me and i will speak unto thee all the commandments and the statutes and the judgments which thou shalt teach them that they may do them in the land which i give them to possess it
ye shall observe to do therefore as the lord your god hath commanded you ye shall not turn aside to the right hand or to the left
ye shall walk in all the ways which the lord your god hath commanded you that ye may live and that it may be well with you and that ye may prolong your days in the land which ye shall possess
now these are the commandments the statutes and the judgments which the lord your god commanded to teach you that ye might do them in the land whither ye go to possess it
that thou mightest fear the lord thy god to keep all his statutes and his commandments which i command thee thou and thy son and thy son's son all the days of thy life and that thy days may be prolonged
hear therefore o israel and observe to do it that it may be well with thee and that ye may increase mightily as the lord god of thy fathers hath promised thee in the land that floweth with milk and honey
hear o israel the lord our god is one lord
and thou shalt love the lord thy god with all thine heart and with all thy soul and with all thy might
and these words which i command thee this day shall be in thine heart
and thou shalt teach them diligently unto thy children and shalt talk of them when thou sittest in thine house and when thou walkest by the way and when thou liest down and when thou risest up
and thou shalt bind them for a sign upon thine hand and they shall be as frontlets between thine eyes
and thou shalt write them upon the posts of thy house and on thy gates
and it shall be when the lord thy god shall have brought thee into the land which he sware unto thy fathers to abraham to isaac and to jacob to give thee great and goodly cities which thou buildedst not
and houses full of all good things which thou filledst not and wells digged which thou diggedst not vineyards and olive trees which thou plantedst not when thou shalt have eaten and be full
then beware lest thou forget the lord which brought thee forth out of the land of egypt from the house of bondage
thou shalt fear the lord thy god and serve him and shalt swear by his name
ye shall not go after other gods of the gods of the people which are round about you
for the lord thy god is a jealous god among you lest the anger of the lord thy god be kindled against thee and destroy thee from off the face of the earth
ye shall not tempt the lord your god as ye tempted him in massah
ye shall diligently keep the commandments of the lord your god and his testimonies and his statutes which he hath commanded thee
and thou shalt do that which is right and good in the sight of the lord that it may be well with thee and that thou mayest go in and possess the good land which the lord sware unto thy fathers
to cast out all thine enemies from before thee as the lord hath spoken
and when thy son asketh thee in time to come saying what mean the testimonies and the statutes and the judgments which the lord our god hath commanded you
then thou shalt say unto thy son we were pharaoh's bondmen in egypt and the lord brought us out of egypt with a mighty hand
and the lord shewed signs and wonders great and sore upon egypt upon pharaoh and upon all his household before our eyes
and he brought us out from thence that he might bring us in to give us the land which he sware unto our fathers
and the lord commanded us to do all these statutes to fear the lord our god for our good always that he might preserve us alive as it is at this day
and it shall be our righteousness if we observe to do all these commandments before the lord our god as he hath commanded us
when the lord thy god shall bring thee into the land whither thou goest to possess it and hath cast out many nations before thee the hittites and the girgashites and the amorites and the canaanites and the perizzites and the hivites and the jebusites seven nations greater and mightier than thou
and when the lord thy god shall deliver them before thee thou shalt smite them and utterly destroy them thou shalt make no covenant with them nor shew mercy unto them
neither shalt thou make marriages with them thy daughter thou shalt not give unto his son nor his daughter shalt thou take unto thy son
for they will turn away thy son from following me that they may serve other gods so will the anger of the lord be kindled against you and destroy thee suddenly
but thus shall ye deal with them ye shall destroy their altars and break down their images and cut down their groves and burn their graven images with fire
for thou art an holy people unto the lord thy god the lord thy god hath chosen thee to be a special people unto himself above all people that are upon the face of the earth
the lord did not set his love upon you nor choose you because ye were more in number than any people for ye were the fewest of all people
but because the lord loved you and because he would keep the oath which he had sworn unto your fathers hath the lord brought you out with a mighty hand and redeemed you out of the house of bondmen from the hand of pharaoh king of egypt
know therefore that the lord thy god he is god the faithful god which keepeth covenant and mercy with them that love him and keep his commandments to a thousand generations
and repayeth them that hate him to their face to destroy them he will not be slack to him that hateth him he will repay him to his face
thou shalt therefore keep the commandments and the statutes and the judgments which i command thee this day to do them
wherefore it shall come to pass if ye hearken to these judgments and keep and do them that the lord thy god shall keep unto thee the covenant and the mercy which he sware unto thy fathers
and he will love thee and bless thee and multiply thee he will also bless the fruit of thy womb and the fruit of thy land thy corn and thy wine and thine oil the increase of thy kine and the flocks of thy sheep in the land which he sware unto thy fathers to give thee
thou shalt be blessed above all people there shall not be male or female barren among you or among your cattle
and the lord will take away from thee all sickness and will put none of the evil diseases of egypt which thou knowest upon thee but will lay them upon all them that hate thee
and thou shalt consume all the people which the lord thy god shall deliver thee thine eye shall have no pity upon them neither shalt thou serve their gods for that will be a snare unto thee
if thou shalt say in thine heart these nations are more than i how can i dispossess them
thou shalt not be afraid of them but shalt well remember what the lord thy god did unto pharaoh and unto all egypt
the great temptations which thine eyes saw and the signs and the wonders and the mighty hand and the stretched out arm whereby the lord thy god brought thee out so shall the lord thy god do unto all the people of whom thou art afraid
moreover the lord thy god will send the hornet among them until they that are left and hide themselves from thee be destroyed
thou shalt not be affrighted at them for the lord thy god is among you a mighty god and terrible
and the lord thy god will put out those nations before thee by little and little thou mayest not consume them at once lest the beasts of the field increase upon thee
but the lord thy god shall deliver them unto thee and shall destroy them with a mighty destruction until they be destroyed
and he shall deliver their kings into thine hand and thou shalt destroy their name from under heaven there shall no man be able to stand before thee until thou have destroyed them
the graven images of their gods shall ye burn with fire thou shalt not desire the silver or gold that is on them nor take it unto thee lest thou be snared therein for it is an abomination to the lord thy god
neither shalt thou bring an abomination into thine house lest thou be a cursed thing like it but thou shalt utterly detest it and thou shalt utterly abhor it for it is a cursed thing
all the commandments which i command thee this day shall ye observe to do that ye may live and multiply and go in and possess the land which the lord sware unto your fathers
and thou shalt remember all the way which the lord thy god led thee these forty years in the wilderness to humble thee and to prove thee to know what was in thine heart whether thou wouldest keep his commandments or no
and he humbled thee and suffered thee to hunger and fed thee with manna which thou knewest not neither did thy fathers know that he might make thee know that man doth not live by bread only but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of the lord doth man live
thy raiment waxed not old upon thee neither did thy foot swell these forty years
thou shalt also consider in thine heart that as a man chasteneth his son so the lord thy god chasteneth thee
therefore thou shalt keep the commandments of the lord thy god to walk in his ways and to fear him
for the lord thy god bringeth thee into a good land a land of brooks of water of fountains and depths that spring out of valleys and hills
a land of wheat and barley and vines and fig trees and pomegranates a land of oil olive and honey
a land wherein thou shalt eat bread without scarceness thou shalt not lack any thing in it a land whose stones are iron and out of whose hills thou mayest dig brass
when thou hast eaten and art full then thou shalt bless the lord thy god for the good land which he hath given thee
beware that thou forget not the lord thy god in not keeping his commandments and his judgments and his statutes which i command thee this day
lest when thou hast eaten and art full and hast built goodly houses and dwelt therein
and when thy herds and thy flocks multiply and thy silver and thy gold is multiplied and all that thou hast is multiplied
then thine heart be lifted up and thou forget the lord thy god which brought thee forth out of the land of egypt from the house of bondage
who led thee through that great and terrible wilderness wherein were fiery serpents and scorpions and drought where there was no water who brought thee forth water out of the rock of flint
who fed thee in the wilderness with manna which thy fathers knew not that he might humble thee and that he might prove thee to do thee good at thy latter end
and thou say in thine heart my power and the might of mine hand hath gotten me this wealth
but thou shalt remember the lord thy god for it is he that giveth thee power to get wealth that he may establish his covenant which he sware unto thy fathers as it is this day
and it shall be if thou do at all forget the lord thy god and walk after other gods and serve them and worship them i testify against you this day that ye shall surely perish
as the nations which the lord destroyeth before your face so shall ye perish because ye would not be obedient unto the voice of the lord your god
hear o israel thou art to pass over jordan this day to go in to possess nations greater and mightier than thyself cities great and fenced up to heaven
a people great and tall the children of the anakims whom thou knowest and of whom thou hast heard say who can stand before the children of anak
understand therefore this day that the lord thy god is he which goeth over before thee as a consuming fire he shall destroy them and he shall bring them down before thy face so shalt thou drive them out and destroy them quickly as the lord hath said unto thee
speak not thou in thine heart after that the lord thy god hath cast them out from before thee saying for my righteousness the lord hath brought me in to possess this land but for the wickedness of these nations the lord doth drive them out from before thee
not for thy righteousness or for the uprightness of thine heart dost thou go to possess their land but for the wickedness of these nations the lord thy god doth drive them out from before thee and that he may perform the word which the lord sware unto thy fathers abraham isaac and jacob
understand therefore that the lord thy god giveth thee not this good land to possess it for thy righteousness for thou art a stiffnecked people
remember and forget not how thou provokedst the lord thy god to wrath in the wilderness from the day that thou didst depart out of the land of egypt until ye came unto this place ye have been rebellious against the lord
also in horeb ye provoked the lord to wrath so that the lord was angry with you to have destroyed you
when i was gone up into the mount to receive the tables of stone even the tables of the covenant which the lord made with you then i abode in the mount forty days and forty nights i neither did eat bread nor drink water
and the lord delivered unto me two tables of stone written with the finger of god and on them was written according to all the words which the lord spake with you in the mount out of the midst of the fire in the day of the assembly
and it came to pass at the end of forty days and forty nights that the lord gave me the two tables of stone even the tables of the covenant
and the lord said unto me arise get thee down quickly from hence for thy people which thou hast brought forth out of egypt have corrupted themselves they are quickly turned aside out of the way which i commanded them they have made them a molten image
furthermore the lord spake unto me saying i have seen this people and behold it is a stiffnecked people
let me alone that i may destroy them and blot out their name from under heaven and i will make of thee a nation mightier and greater than they
so i turned and came down from the mount and the mount burned with fire and the two tables of the covenant were in my two hands
and i looked and behold ye had sinned against the lord your god and had made you a molten calf ye had turned aside quickly out of the way which the lord had commanded you
and i took the two tables and cast them out of my two hands and brake them before your eyes
and i fell down before the lord as at the first forty days and forty nights i did neither eat bread nor drink water because of all your sins which ye sinned in doing wickedly in the sight of the lord to provoke him to anger
for i was afraid of the anger and hot displeasure wherewith the lord was wroth against you to destroy you but the lord hearkened unto me at that time also
and the lord was very angry with aaron to have destroyed him and i prayed for aaron also the same time
and i took your sin the calf which ye had made and burnt it with fire and stamped it and ground it very small even until it was as small as dust and i cast the dust thereof into the brook that descended out of the mount
and at taberah and at massah and at kibrothhattaavah ye provoked the lord to wrath
likewise when the lord sent you from kadeshbarnea saying go up and possess the land which i have given you then ye rebelled against the commandment of the lord your god and ye believed him not nor hearkened to his voice
ye have been rebellious against the lord from the day that i knew you
thus i fell down before the lord forty days and forty nights as i fell down at the first because the lord had said he would destroy you
i prayed therefore unto the lord and said o lord god destroy not thy people and thine inheritance which thou hast redeemed through thy greatness which thou hast brought forth out of egypt with a mighty hand
remember thy servants abraham isaac and jacob look not unto the stubbornness of this people nor to their wickedness nor to their sin
lest the land whence thou broughtest us out say because the lord was not able to bring them into the land which he promised them and because he hated them he hath brought them out to slay them in the wilderness
yet they are thy people and thine inheritance which thou broughtest out by thy mighty power and by thy stretched out arm
at that time the lord said unto me hew thee two tables of stone like unto the first and come up unto me into the mount and make thee an ark of wood
and i will write on the tables the words that were in the first tables which thou brakest and thou shalt put them in the ark
and i made an ark of shittim wood and hewed two tables of stone like unto the first and went up into the mount having the two tables in mine hand
and he wrote on the tables according to the first writing the ten commandments which the lord spake unto you in the mount out of the midst of the fire in the day of the assembly and the lord gave them unto me
and i turned myself and came down from the mount and put the tables in the ark which i had made and there they be as the lord commanded me
and the children of israel took their journey from beeroth of the children of jaakan to mosera there aaron died and there he was buried and eleazar his son ministered in the priest's office in his stead
from thence they journeyed unto gudgodah and from gudgodah to jotbath a land of rivers of waters
at that time the lord separated the tribe of levi to bear the ark of the covenant of the lord to stand before the lord to minister unto him and to bless in his name unto this day
wherefore levi hath no part nor inheritance with his brethren the lord is his inheritance according as the lord thy god promised him
and i stayed in the mount according to the first time forty days and forty nights and the lord hearkened unto me at that time also and the lord would not destroy thee
and the lord said unto me arise take thy journey before the people that they may go in and possess the land which i sware unto their fathers to give unto them
