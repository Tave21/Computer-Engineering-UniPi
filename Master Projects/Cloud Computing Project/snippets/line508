 and when you loved you were my other husband
claudio another hero
hero nothing certainer
 one hero died defiled but i do live
 and surely as i live i am a maid
don pedro the former hero hero that is dead
leonato she died my lord but whiles her slander lived
friar francis all this amazement can i qualify
 when after that the holy rites are ended
 i'll tell you largely of fair hero's death
 meantime let wonder seem familiar
 and to the chapel let us presently
benedick soft and fair friar which is beatrice
beatrice unmasking i answer to that name what is your will
benedick do not you love me
beatrice why no no more than reason
benedick why then your uncle and the prince and claudio
 have been deceived they swore you did
beatrice do not you love me
benedick troth no no more than reason
beatrice why then my cousin margaret and ursula
 are much deceived for they did swear you did
benedick they swore that you were almost sick for me
beatrice they swore that you were wellnigh dead for me
benedick tis no such matter then you do not love me
beatrice no truly but in friendly recompense
leonato come cousin i am sure you love the gentleman
claudio and i'll be sworn upon't that he loves her
 for here's a paper written in his hand
 a halting sonnet of his own pure brain
 fashion'd to beatrice
hero and here's another
 writ in my cousin's hand stolen from her pocket
 containing her affection unto benedick
benedick a miracle here's our own hands against our hearts
 come i will have thee but by this light i take
 thee for pity
beatrice i would not deny you but by this good day i yield
 upon great persuasion and partly to save your life
 for i was told you were in a consumption
benedick peace i will stop your mouth
 kissing her
don pedro how dost thou benedick the married man
benedick i'll tell thee what prince a college of
 witcrackers cannot flout me out of my humour dost
 thou think i care for a satire or an epigram no
 if a man will be beaten with brains a shall wear
 nothing handsome about him in brief since i do
 purpose to marry i will think nothing to any
 purpose that the world can say against it and
 therefore never flout at me for what i have said
 against it for man is a giddy thing and this is my
 conclusion for thy part claudio i did think to
 have beaten thee but in that thou art like to be my
 kinsman live unbruised and love my cousin
claudio i had well hoped thou wouldst have denied beatrice
 that i might have cudgelled thee out of thy single
 life to make thee a doubledealer which out of
 question thou wilt be if my cousin do not look
 exceedingly narrowly to thee
benedick come come we are friends let's have a dance ere
 we are married that we may lighten our own hearts
 and our wives heels
leonato we'll have dancing afterward
benedick first of my word therefore play music prince
 thou art sad get thee a wife get thee a wife
 there is no staff more reverend than one tipped with horn
 enter a messenger
messenger my lord your brother john is ta'en in flight
 and brought with armed men back to messina
benedick think not on him till tomorrow
 i'll devise thee brave punishments for him
 strike up pipers
 dance

diana
gower as chorus
scene dispersedly in various countries
 pericles prince of tyre
act i
 enter gower
 before the palace of antioch
 to sing a song that old was sung
 from ashes ancient gower is come
 assuming man's infirmities
 to glad your ear and please your eyes
 it hath been sung at festivals
 on embereves and holyales
 and lords and ladies in their lives
 have read it for restoratives
 the purchase is to make men glorious
 et bonum quo antiquius eo melius
 if you born in these latter times
 when wit's more ripe accept my rhymes
 and that to hear an old man sing
 may to your wishes pleasure bring
 i life would wish and that i might
 waste it for you like taperlight
 this antioch then antiochus the great
 built up this city for his chiefest seat
 the fairest in all syria
 i tell you what mine authors say
 this king unto him took a fere
 who died and left a female heir
 so buxom blithe and full of face
 as heaven had lent her all his grace
 with whom the father liking took
 and her to incest did provoke
 bad child worse father to entice his own
 to evil should be done by none
 but custom what they did begin
 was with long use account no sin
 the beauty of this sinful dame
 made many princes thither frame
 to seek her as a bedfellow
 in marriagepleasures playfellow
 which to prevent he made a law
 to keep her still and men in awe
 that whoso ask'd her for his wife
 his riddle told not lost his life
 so for her many a wight did die
 as yon grim looks do testify
 what now ensues to the judgment of your eye
 i give my cause who best can justify
 exit
 pericles prince of tyre
act i
scene i antioch a room in the palace
 enter antiochus prince pericles and followers
antiochus young prince of tyre you have at large received
 the danger of the task you undertake
pericles i have antiochus and with a soul
 embolden'd with the glory of her praise
 think death no hazard in this enterprise
antiochus bring in our daughter clothed like a bride
 for the embracements even of jove himself
 at whose conception till lucina reign'd
 nature this dowry gave to glad her presence
 the senatehouse of planets all did sit
 to knit in her their best perfections
 music enter the daughter of antiochus
pericles see where she comes apparell'd like the spring
 graces her subjects and her thoughts the king
 of every virtue gives renown to men
 her face the book of praises where is read
 nothing but curious pleasures as from thence
 sorrow were ever razed and testy wrath
 could never be her mild companion
 you gods that made me man and sway in love
 that have inflamed desire in my breast
 to taste the fruit of yon celestial tree
 or die in the adventure be my helps
 as i am son and servant to your will
 to compass such a boundless happiness
antiochus prince pericles
pericles that would be son to great antiochus
antiochus before thee stands this fair hesperides
 with golden fruit but dangerous to be touch'd
