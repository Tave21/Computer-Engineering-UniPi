 can i demand
montague but i can give thee more
 for i will raise her statue in pure gold
 that while verona by that name is known
 there shall no figure at such rate be set
 as that of true and faithful juliet
capulet as rich shall romeo's by his lady's lie
 poor sacrifices of our enmity
prince a glooming peace this morning with it brings
 the sun for sorrow will not show his head
 go hence to have more talk of these sad things
 some shall be pardon'd and some punished
 for never was a story of more woe
 than this of juliet and her romeo

scene athens and the neighbouring woods
 timon of athens
act i
scene i athens a hall in timon's house
 enter poet painter jeweller merchant and
 others at several doors
poet good day sir
painter i am glad you're well
poet i have not seen you long how goes the world
painter it wears sir as it grows
poet ay that's well known
 but what particular rarity what strange
 which manifold record not matches see
 magic of bounty all these spirits thy power
 hath conjured to attend i know the merchant
painter i know them both th other's a jeweller
merchant o tis a worthy lord
jeweller nay that's most fix'd
merchant a most incomparable man breathed as it were
 to an untirable and continuate goodness
 he passes
jeweller i have a jewel here
merchant o pray let's see't for the lord timon sir
jeweller if he will touch the estimate but for that
poet reciting to himself when we for recompense have
 praised the vile
 it stains the glory in that happy verse
 which aptly sings the good'
merchant tis a good form
 looking at the jewel
jeweller and rich here is a water look ye
painter you are rapt sir in some work some dedication
 to the great lord
poet a thing slipp'd idly from me
 our poesy is as a gum which oozes
 from whence tis nourish'd the fire i the flint
 shows not till it be struck our gentle flame
 provokes itself and like the current flies
 each bound it chafes what have you there
painter a picture sir when comes your book forth
poet upon the heels of my presentment sir
 let's see your piece
painter tis a good piece
poet so tis this comes off well and excellent
painter indifferent
poet admirable how this grace
 speaks his own standing what a mental power
 this eye shoots forth how big imagination
 moves in this lip to the dumbness of the gesture
 one might interpret
painter it is a pretty mocking of the life
 here is a touch is't good
poet i will say of it
 it tutors nature artificial strife
 lives in these touches livelier than life
 enter certain senators and pass over
painter how this lord is follow'd
poet the senators of athens happy man
painter look more
poet you see this confluence this great flood
 of visitors
 i have in this rough work shaped out a man
 whom this beneath world doth embrace and hug
 with amplest entertainment my free drift
 halts not particularly but moves itself
 in a wide sea of wax no levell'd malice
 infects one comma in the course i hold
 but flies an eagle flight bold and forth on
 leaving no tract behind
painter how shall i understand you
poet i will unbolt to you
 you see how all conditions how all minds
 as well of glib and slippery creatures as
 of grave and austere quality tender down
 their services to lord timon his large fortune
 upon his good and gracious nature hanging
 subdues and properties to his love and tendance
 all sorts of hearts yea from the glassfaced flatterer
 to apemantus that few things loves better
 than to abhor himself even he drops down
 the knee before him and returns in peace
 most rich in timon's nod
painter i saw them speak together
poet sir i have upon a high and pleasant hill
 feign'd fortune to be throned the base o the mount
 is rank'd with all deserts all kind of natures
 that labour on the bosom of this sphere
 to propagate their states amongst them all
 whose eyes are on this sovereign lady fix'd
 one do i personate of lord timon's frame
 whom fortune with her ivory hand wafts to her
 whose present grace to present slaves and servants
 translates his rivals
painter tis conceived to scope
 this throne this fortune and this hill methinks
 with one man beckon'd from the rest below
 bowing his head against the sleepy mount
 to climb his happiness would be well express'd
 in our condition
poet nay sir but hear me on
 all those which were his fellows but of late
 some better than his value on the moment
 follow his strides his lobbies fill with tendance
 rain sacrificial whisperings in his ear
 make sacred even his stirrup and through him
 drink the free air
painter ay marry what of these
poet when fortune in her shift and change of mood
 spurns down her late beloved all his dependants
 which labour'd after him to the mountain's top
 even on their knees and hands let him slip down
 not one accompanying his declining foot
painter tis common
 a thousand moral paintings i can show
 that shall demonstrate these quick blows of fortune's
 more pregnantly than words yet you do well
 to show lord timon that mean eyes have seen
 the foot above the head
 trumpets sound enter timon addressing himself
 courteously to every suitor a messenger from
