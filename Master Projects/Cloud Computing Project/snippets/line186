 when what's not meet but what must be was law
 then were they chosen in a better hour
 let what is meet be said it must be meet
 and throw their power i the dust
brutus manifest treason
sicinius this a consul no
brutus the aediles ho
 enter an aedile
 let him be apprehended
sicinius go call the people
 exit aedile
 in whose name myself
 attach thee as a traitorous innovator
 a foe to the public weal obey i charge thee
 and follow to thine answer
coriolanus hence old goat
senators &c we'll surety him
cominius aged sir hands off
coriolanus hence rotten thing or i shall shake thy bones
 out of thy garments
sicinius help ye citizens
 enter a rabble of citizens plebeians with
 the aediles
menenius on both sides more respect
sicinius here's he that would take from you all your power
brutus seize him aediles
citizens down with him down with him
senators &c weapons weapons weapons
 they all bustle about coriolanus crying
 tribunes patricians citizens what ho'
 sicinius brutus coriolanus citizens'
 peace peace peace stay hold peace'
menenius what is about to be i am out of breath
 confusion's near i cannot speak you tribunes
 to the people coriolanus patience
 speak good sicinius
sicinius hear me people peace
citizens let's hear our tribune peace speak speak speak
sicinius you are at point to lose your liberties
 marcius would have all from you marcius
 whom late you have named for consul
menenius fie fie fie
 this is the way to kindle not to quench
first senator to unbuild the city and to lay all flat
sicinius what is the city but the people
citizens true
 the people are the city
brutus by the consent of all we were establish'd
 the people's magistrates
citizens you so remain
menenius and so are like to do
cominius that is the way to lay the city flat
 to bring the roof to the foundation
 and bury all which yet distinctly ranges
 in heaps and piles of ruin
sicinius this deserves death
brutus or let us stand to our authority
 or let us lose it we do here pronounce
 upon the part o the people in whose power
 we were elected theirs marcius is worthy
 of present death
sicinius therefore lay hold of him
 bear him to the rock tarpeian and from thence
 into destruction cast him
brutus aediles seize him
citizens yield marcius yield
menenius hear me one word
 beseech you tribunes hear me but a word
aedile peace peace
menenius to brutus be that you seem truly your
 country's friend
 and temperately proceed to what you would
 thus violently redress
brutus sir those cold ways
 that seem like prudent helps are very poisonous
 where the disease is violent lay hands upon him
 and bear him to the rock
coriolanus no i'll die here
 drawing his sword
 there's some among you have beheld me fighting
 come try upon yourselves what you have seen me
menenius down with that sword tribunes withdraw awhile
brutus lay hands upon him
cominius help marcius help
 you that be noble help him young and old
citizens down with him down with him
 in this mutiny the tribunes the aediles and the
 people are beat in
menenius go get you to your house be gone away
 all will be naught else
second senator get you gone
cominius stand fast
 we have as many friends as enemies
menenius sham it be put to that
first senator the gods forbid
 i prithee noble friend home to thy house
 leave us to cure this cause
menenius for tis a sore upon us
 you cannot tent yourself be gone beseech you
cominius come sir along with us
coriolanus i would they were barbariansas they are
 though in rome litter'dnot romansas they are not
 though calved i the porch o the capitol
menenius be gone
 put not your worthy rage into your tongue
 one time will owe another
coriolanus on fair ground
 i could beat forty of them
cominius i could myself
 take up a brace o the best of them yea the
 two tribunes
 but now tis odds beyond arithmetic
 and manhood is call'd foolery when it stands
 against a falling fabric will you hence
 before the tag return whose rage doth rend
 like interrupted waters and o'erbear
 what they are used to bear
menenius pray you be gone
 i'll try whether my old wit be in request
 with those that have but little this must be patch'd
 with cloth of any colour
cominius nay come away
 exeunt coriolanus cominius and others
a patrician this man has marr'd his fortune
menenius his nature is too noble for the world
 he would not flatter neptune for his trident
 or jove for's power to thunder his heart's his mouth
 what his breast forges that his tongue must vent
 and being angry does forget that ever
 he heard the name of death
 a noise within
 here's goodly work
second patrician i would they were abed
menenius i would they were in tiber what the vengeance
 could he not speak em fair
 reenter brutus and sicinius with the rabble
sicinius where is this viper
 that would depopulate the city and
 be every man himself
menenius you worthy tribunes
sicinius he shall be thrown down the tarpeian rock
 with rigorous hands he hath resisted law
 and therefore law shall scorn him further trial
 than the severity of the public power
 which he so sets at nought
first citizen he shall well know
 the noble tribunes are the people's mouths
 and we their hands
citizens he shall sure on't
menenius sir sir
sicinius peace
menenius do not cry havoc where you should but hunt
 with modest warrant
sicinius sir how comes't that you
 have holp to make this rescue
menenius hear me speak
 as i do know the consul's worthiness
 so can i name his faults
sicinius consul what consul
menenius the consul coriolanus
brutus he consul
citizens no no no no no
menenius if by the tribunes leave and yours good people
 i may be heard i would crave a word or two
 the which shall turn you to no further harm
 than so much loss of time
sicinius speak briefly then
 for we are peremptory to dispatch
 this viperous traitor to eject him hence
 were but one danger and to keep him here
 our certain death therefore it is decreed
 he dies tonight
menenius now the good gods forbid
 that our renowned rome whose gratitude
 towards her deserved children is enroll'd
 in jove's own book like an unnatural dam
 should now eat up her own
sicinius he's a disease that must be cut away
menenius o he's a limb that has but a disease
 mortal to cut it off to cure it easy
 what has he done to rome that's worthy death
 killing our enemies the blood he hath lost
 which i dare vouch is more than that he hath
 by many an ouncehe dropp'd it for his country
 and what is left to lose it by his country
 were to us all that do't and suffer it
 a brand to the end o the world
sicinius this is clean kam
brutus merely awry when he did love his country
 it honour'd him
menenius the service of the foot
 being once gangrened is not then respected
 for what before it was
brutus we'll hear no more
 pursue him to his house and pluck him thence
 lest his infection being of catching nature
 spread further
menenius one word more one word
 this tigerfooted rage when it shall find
 the harm of unscann'd swiftness will too late
