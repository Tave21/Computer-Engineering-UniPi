 he ask'd me for a thousand marks in gold
 'tis dinnertime quoth i my gold quoth he
 your meat doth burn quoth i my gold quoth he
 will you come home quoth i my gold quoth he
 where is the thousand marks i gave thee villain'
 the pig quoth i is burn'd my gold quoth he
 my mistress sir quoth i hang up thy mistress
 i know not thy mistress out on thy mistress'
luciana quoth who
dromio of ephesus quoth my master
 i know quoth he no house no wife no mistress'
 so that my errand due unto my tongue
 i thank him i bare home upon my shoulders
 for in conclusion he did beat me there
adriana go back again thou slave and fetch him home
dromio of ephesus go back again and be new beaten home
 for god's sake send some other messenger
adriana back slave or i will break thy pate across
dromio of ephesus and he will bless that cross with other beating
 between you i shall have a holy head
adriana hence prating peasant fetch thy master home
dromio of ephesus am i so round with you as you with me
 that like a football you do spurn me thus
 you spurn me hence and he will spurn me hither
 if i last in this service you must case me in leather
 exit
luciana fie how impatience loureth in your face
adriana his company must do his minions grace
 whilst i at home starve for a merry look
 hath homely age the alluring beauty took
 from my poor cheek then he hath wasted it
 are my discourses dull barren my wit
 if voluble and sharp discourse be marr'd
 unkindness blunts it more than marble hard
 do their gay vestments his affections bait
 that's not my fault he's master of my state
 what ruins are in me that can be found
 by him not ruin'd then is he the ground
 of my defeatures my decayed fair
 a sunny look of his would soon repair
 but too unruly deer he breaks the pale
 and feeds from home poor i am but his stale
luciana selfharming jealousy fie beat it hence
adriana unfeeling fools can with such wrongs dispense
 i know his eye doth homage otherwhere
 or else what lets it but he would be here
 sister you know he promised me a chain
 would that alone alone he would detain
 so he would keep fair quarter with his bed
 i see the jewel best enamelled
 will lose his beauty yet the gold bides still
 that others touch and often touching will
 wear gold and no man that hath a name
 by falsehood and corruption doth it shame
 since that my beauty cannot please his eye
 i'll weep what's left away and weeping die
luciana how many fond fools serve mad jealousy
 exeunt
 the comedy of errors
act ii
scene ii a public place
 enter antipholus of syracuse
antipholus
of syracuse the gold i gave to dromio is laid up
 safe at the centaur and the heedful slave
 is wander'd forth in care to seek me out
 by computation and mine host's report
 i could not speak with dromio since at first
 i sent him from the mart see here he comes
 enter dromio of syracuse
 how now sir is your merry humour alter'd
 as you love strokes so jest with me again
 you know no centaur you received no gold
 your mistress sent to have me home to dinner
 my house was at the phoenix wast thou mad
 that thus so madly thou didst answer me
dromio of syracuse what answer sir when spake i such a word
antipholus
of syracuse even now even here not half an hour since
dromio of syracuse i did not see you since you sent me hence
 home to the centaur with the gold you gave me
antipholus
of syracuse villain thou didst deny the gold's receipt
 and told'st me of a mistress and a dinner
 for which i hope thou felt'st i was displeased
dromio of syracuse i am glad to see you in this merry vein
 what means this jest i pray you master tell me
antipholus
of syracuse yea dost thou jeer and flout me in the teeth
 think'st thou i jest hold take thou that and that
 beating him
dromio of syracuse hold sir for god's sake now your jest is earnest
 upon what bargain do you give it me
antipholus
of syracuse because that i familiarly sometimes
 do use you for my fool and chat with you
 your sauciness will jest upon my love
 and make a common of my serious hours
 when the sun shines let foolish gnats make sport
 but creep in crannies when he hides his beams
 if you will jest with me know my aspect
 and fashion your demeanor to my looks
 or i will beat this method in your sconce
dromio of syracuse sconce call you it so you would leave battering i
 had rather have it a head an you use these blows
 long i must get a sconce for my head and ensconce
 it too or else i shall seek my wit in my shoulders
 but i pray sir why am i beaten
antipholus
of syracuse dost thou not know
dromio of syracuse nothing sir but that i am beaten
antipholus
of syracuse shall i tell you why
dromio of syracuse ay sir and wherefore for they say every why hath
 a wherefore
antipholus
of syracuse why firstfor flouting me and then wherefore
 for urging it the second time to me
dromio of syracuse was there ever any man thus beaten out of season
 when in the why and the wherefore is neither rhyme
 nor reason
 well sir i thank you
antipholus
of syracuse thank me sir for what
dromio of syracuse marry sir for this something that you gave me for nothing
antipholus
of syracuse i'll make you amends next to give you nothing for
 something but say sir is it dinnertime
dromio of syracuse no sir i think the meat wants that i have
antipholus
of syracuse in good time sir what's that
dromio of syracuse basting
antipholus
of syracuse well sir then twill be dry
dromio of syracuse if it be sir i pray you eat none of it
antipholus
of syracuse your reason
dromio of syracuse lest it make you choleric and purchase me another
 dry basting
antipholus
of syracuse well sir learn to jest in good time there's a
 time for all things
dromio of syracuse i durst have denied that before you were so choleric
antipholus
of syracuse by what rule sir
dromio of syracuse marry sir by a rule as plain as the plain bald
 pate of father time himself
antipholus
of syracuse let's hear it
dromio of syracuse there's no time for a man to recover his hair that
 grows bald by nature
antipholus
of syracuse may he not do it by fine and recovery
dromio of syracuse yes to pay a fine for a periwig and recover the
 lost hair of another man
antipholus
of syracuse why is time such a niggard of hair being as it is
 so plentiful an excrement
dromio of syracuse because it is a blessing that he bestows on beasts
 and what he hath scanted men in hair he hath given them in wit
antipholus
of syracuse why but there's many a man hath more hair than wit
dromio of syracuse not a man of those but he hath the wit to lose his hair
antipholus
of syracuse why thou didst conclude hairy men plain dealers without wit
dromio of syracuse the plainer dealer the sooner lost yet he loseth
 it in a kind of jollity
antipholus
of syracuse for what reason
dromio of syracuse for two and sound ones too
antipholus
of syracuse nay not sound i pray you
dromio of syracuse sure ones then
antipholus
of syracuse nay not sure in a thing falsing
dromio of syracuse certain ones then
antipholus
of syracuse name them
dromio of syracuse the one to save the money that he spends in
 trimming the other that at dinner they should not
 drop in his porridge
antipholus
of syracuse you would all this time have proved there is no
 time for all things
dromio of syracuse marry and did sir namely no time to recover hair
 lost by nature
antipholus
of syracuse but your reason was not substantial why there is no
 time to recover
dromio of syracuse thus i mend it time himself is bald and therefore
 to the world's end will have bald followers
antipholus
of syracuse i knew twould be a bald conclusion
 but soft who wafts us yonder
 enter adriana and luciana
adriana ay ay antipholus look strange and frown
 some other mistress hath thy sweet aspects
 i am not adriana nor thy wife
 the time was once when thou unurged wouldst vow
 that never words were music to thine ear
