 tread on the sand why there you quickly sink
 bestride the rock the tide will wash you off
 or else you famish that's a threefold death
 this speak i lords to let you understand
 if case some one of you would fly from us
 that there's no hopedfor mercy with the brothers
 more than with ruthless waves with sands and rocks
 why courage then what cannot be avoided
 twere childish weakness to lament or fear
prince edward methinks a woman of this valiant spirit
 should if a coward heard her speak these words
 infuse his breast with magnanimity
 and make him naked foil a man at arms
 i speak not this as doubting any here
 for did i but suspect a fearful man
 he should have leave to go away betimes
 lest in our need he might infect another
 and make him of like spirit to himself
 if any such be hereas god forbid
 let him depart before we need his help
oxford women and children of so high a courage
 and warriors faint why twere perpetual shame
 o brave young prince thy famous grandfather
 doth live again in thee long mayst thou live
 to bear his image and renew his glories
somerset and he that will not fight for such a hope
 go home to bed and like the owl by day
 if he arise be mock'd and wonder'd at
queen margaret thanks gentle somerset sweet oxford thanks
prince edward and take his thanks that yet hath nothing else

messenger prepare you lords for edward is at hand
 ready to fight therefore be resolute

 and yonder is the wolf that makes this spoil

queen margaret o ned sweet ned speak to thy mother boy
 canst thou not speak o traitors murderers
 they that stabb'd caesar shed no blood at all
 did not offend nor were not worthy blame
 if this foul deed were by to equal it
 he was a man this in respect a child
 and men ne'er spend their fury on a child
 what's worse than murderer that i may name it
 no no my heart will burst and if i speak
 and i will speak that so my heart may burst
 butchers and villains bloody cannibals
 how sweet a plant have you untimely cropp'd
 you have no children butchers if you had
 the thought of them would have stirr'd up remorse
 but if you ever chance to have a child
 look in his youth to have him so cut off
 as deathmen you have rid this sweet young prince
king edward iv away with her go bear her hence perforce
queen margaret nay never bear me hence dispatch me here
 here sheathe thy sword i'll pardon thee my death

scene vi london the tower
 enter king henry vi and gloucester with the
 lieutenant on the walls
gloucester good day my lord what at your book so hard
king henry vi ay my good lordmy lord i should say rather
 tis sin to flatter good was little better
 good gloucester and good devil were alike
 and both preposterous therefore not good lord'
gloucester sirrah leave us to ourselves we must confer
 exit lieutenant
king henry vi so flies the reckless shepherd from the wolf
 so first the harmless sheep doth yield his fleece
 and next his throat unto the butcher's knife
 what scene of death hath roscius now to act
gloucester suspicion always haunts the guilty mind
 the thief doth fear each bush an officer
king henry vi the bird that hath been limed in a bush
 with trembling wings misdoubteth every bush
 and i the hapless male to one sweet bird
 have now the fatal object in my eye
 where my poor young was limed was caught and kill'd
gloucester why what a peevish fool was that of crete
 that taught his son the office of a fowl
 an yet for all his wings the fool was drown'd
king henry vi i daedalus my poor boy icarus
 thy father minos that denied our course
 the sun that sear'd the wings of my sweet boy
 thy brother edward and thyself the sea
 whose envious gulf did swallow up his life
 ah kill me with thy weapon not with words
 my breast can better brook thy dagger's point
 than can my ears that tragic history
 but wherefore dost thou come is't for my life
gloucester think'st thou i am an executioner
king henry vi a persecutor i am sure thou art
 if murdering innocents be executing
