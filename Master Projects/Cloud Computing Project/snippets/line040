1sm3020 and david took all the flocks and the herds which they drave before those other cattle and said this is david's spoil
1sm3021 and david came to the two hundred men which were so faint that they could not follow david whom they had made also to abide at the brook besor and they went forth to meet david and to meet the people that were with him and when david came near to the people he saluted them
1sm3022 then answered all the wicked men and men of belial of those that went with david and said because they went not with us we will not give them ought of the spoil that we have recovered save to every man his wife and his children that they may lead them away and depart
1sm3023 then said david ye shall not do so my brethren with that which the lord hath given us who hath preserved us and delivered the company that came against us into our hand
1sm3024 for who will hearken unto you in this matter but as his part is that goeth down to the battle so shall his part be that tarrieth by the stuff they shall part alike
1sm3025 and it was so from that day forward that he made it a statute and an ordinance for israel unto this day
1sm3026 and when david came to ziklag he sent of the spoil unto the elders of judah even to his friends saying behold a present for you of the spoil of the enemies of the lord
1sm3027 to them which were in bethel and to them which were in south ramoth and to them which were in jattir
1sm3028 and to them which were in aroer and to them which were in siphmoth and to them which were in eshtemoa
1sm3029 and to them which were in rachal and to them which were in the cities of the jerahmeelites and to them which were in the cities of the kenites
1sm3030 and to them which were in hormah and to them which were in chorashan and to them which were in athach
1sm3031 and to them which were in hebron and to all the places where david himself and his men were wont to haunt
1sm311 now the philistines fought against israel and the men of israel fled from before the philistines and fell down slain in mount gilboa
1sm312 and the philistines followed hard upon saul and upon his sons and the philistines slew jonathan and abinadab and melchishua saul's sons
1sm313 and the battle went sore against saul and the archers hit him and he was sore wounded of the archers
1sm314 then said saul unto his armourbearer draw thy sword and thrust me through therewith lest these uncircumcised come and thrust me through and abuse me but his armourbearer would not for he was sore afraid therefore saul took a sword and fell upon it
1sm315 and when his armourbearer saw that saul was dead he fell likewise upon his sword and died with him
1sm316 so saul died and his three sons and his armourbearer and all his men that same day together
1sm317 and when the men of israel that were on the other side of the valley and they that were on the other side jordan saw that the men of israel fled and that saul and his sons were dead they forsook the cities and fled and the philistines came and dwelt in them
1sm318 and it came to pass on the morrow when the philistines came to strip the slain that they found saul and his three sons fallen in mount gilboa
1sm319 and they cut off his head and stripped off his armour and sent into the land of the philistines round about to publish it in the house of their idols and among the people
1sm3110 and they put his armour in the house of ashtaroth and they fastened his body to the wall of bethshan
1sm3111 and when the inhabitants of jabeshgilead heard of that which the philistines had done to saul
1sm3112 all the valiant men arose and went all night and took the body of saul and the bodies of his sons from the wall of bethshan and came to jabesh and burnt them there
1sm3113 and they took their bones and buried them under a tree at jabesh and fasted seven days
2sm11 now it came to pass after the death of saul when david was returned from the slaughter of the amalekites and david had abode two days in ziklag
2sm12 it came even to pass on the third day that behold a man came out of the camp from saul with his clothes rent and earth upon his head and so it was when he came to david that he fell to the earth and did obeisance
2sm13 and david said unto him from whence comest thou and he said unto him out of the camp of israel am i escaped
2sm14 and david said unto him how went the matter i pray thee tell me and he answered that the people are fled from the battle and many of the people also are fallen and dead and saul and jonathan his son are dead also
2sm15 and david said unto the young man that told him how knowest thou that saul and jonathan his son be dead
2sm16 and the young man that told him said as i happened by chance upon mount gilboa behold saul leaned upon his spear and lo the chariots and horsemen followed hard after him
2sm17 and when he looked behind him he saw me and called unto me and i answered here am i
2sm18 and he said unto me who art thou and i answered him i am an amalekite
2sm19 he said unto me again stand i pray thee upon me and slay me for anguish is come upon me because my life is yet whole in me
2sm110 so i stood upon him and slew him because i was sure that he could not live after that he was fallen and i took the crown that was upon his head and the bracelet that was on his arm and have brought them hither unto my lord
2sm111 then david took hold on his clothes and rent them and likewise all the men that were with him
2sm112 and they mourned and wept and fasted until even for saul and for jonathan his son and for the people of the lord and for the house of israel because they were fallen by the sword
2sm113 and david said unto the young man that told him whence art thou and he answered i am the son of a stranger an amalekite
2sm114 and david said unto him how wast thou not afraid to stretch forth thine hand to destroy the lord's anointed
2sm115 and david called one of the young men and said go near and fall upon him and he smote him that he died
2sm116 and david said unto him thy blood be upon thy head for thy mouth hath testified against thee saying i have slain the lord's anointed
2sm117 and david lamented with this lamentation over saul and over jonathan his son
2sm118 also he bade them teach the children of judah the use of the bow behold it is written in the book of jasher
2sm119 the beauty of israel is slain upon thy high places how are the mighty fallen
2sm120 tell it not in gath publish it not in the streets of askelon lest the daughters of the philistines rejoice lest the daughters of the uncircumcised triumph
2sm121 ye mountains of gilboa let there be no dew neither let there be rain upon you nor fields of offerings for there the shield of the mighty is vilely cast away the shield of saul as though he had not been anointed with oil
2sm122 from the blood of the slain from the fat of the mighty the bow of jonathan turned not back and the sword of saul returned not empty
2sm123 saul and jonathan were lovely and pleasant in their lives and in their death they were not divided they were swifter than eagles they were stronger than lions
2sm124 ye daughters of israel weep over saul who clothed you in scarlet with other delights who put on ornaments of gold upon your apparel
2sm125 how are the mighty fallen in the midst of the battle o jonathan thou wast slain in thine high places
2sm126 i am distressed for thee my brother jonathan very pleasant hast thou been unto me thy love to me was wonderful passing the love of women
2sm127 how are the mighty fallen and the weapons of war perished
2sm21 and it came to pass after this that david enquired of the lord saying shall i go up into any of the cities of judah and the lord said unto him go up and david said whither shall i go up and he said unto hebron
2sm22 so david went up thither and his two wives also ahinoam the jezreelitess and abigail nabal's wife the carmelite
2sm23 and his men that were with him did david bring up every man with his household and they dwelt in the cities of hebron
2sm24 and the men of judah came and there they anointed david king over the house of judah and they told david saying that the men of jabeshgilead were they that buried saul
2sm25 and david sent messengers unto the men of jabeshgilead and said unto them blessed be ye of the lord that ye have shewed this kindness unto your lord even unto saul and have buried him
2sm26 and now the lord shew kindness and truth unto you and i also will requite you this kindness because ye have done this thing
2sm27 therefore now let your hands be strengthened and be ye valiant for your master saul is dead and also the house of judah have anointed me king over them
2sm28 but abner the son of ner captain of saul's host took ishbosheth the son of saul and brought him over to mahanaim
2sm29 and made him king over gilead and over the ashurites and over jezreel and over ephraim and over benjamin and over all israel
2sm210 ishbosheth saul's son was forty years old when he began to reign over israel and reigned two years but the house of judah followed david
2sm211 and the time that david was king in hebron over the house of judah was seven years and six months
2sm212 and abner the son of ner and the servants of ishbosheth the son of saul went out from mahanaim to gibeon
2sm213 and joab the son of zeruiah and the servants of david went out and met together by the pool of gibeon and they sat down the one on the one side of the pool and the other on the other side of the pool
2sm214 and abner said to joab let the young men now arise and play before us and joab said let them arise
2sm215 then there arose and went over by number twelve of benjamin which pertained to ishbosheth the son of saul and twelve of the servants of david
2sm216 and they caught every one his fellow by the head and thrust his sword in his fellow's side so they fell down together wherefore that place was called helkathhazzurim which is in gibeon
2sm217 and there was a very sore battle that day and abner was beaten and the men of israel before the servants of david
2sm218 and there were three sons of zeruiah there joab and abishai and asahel and asahel was as light of foot as a wild roe
2sm219 and asahel pursued after abner and in going he turned not to the right hand nor to the left from following abner
2sm220 then abner looked behind him and said art thou asahel and he answered i am
2sm221 and abner said to him turn thee aside to thy right hand or to thy left and lay thee hold on one of the young men and take thee his armour but asahel would not turn aside from following of him
2sm222 and abner said again to asahel turn thee aside from following me wherefore should i smite thee to the ground how then should i hold up my face to joab thy brother
2sm223 howbeit he refused to turn aside wherefore abner with the hinder end of the spear smote him under the fifth rib that the spear came out behind him and he fell down there and died in the same place and it came to pass that as many as came to the place where asahel fell down and died stood still
2sm224 joab also and abishai pursued after abner and the sun went down when they were come to the hill of ammah that lieth before giah by the way of the wilderness of gibeon
2sm225 and the children of benjamin gathered themselves together after abner and became one troop and stood on the top of an hill
2sm226 then abner called to joab and said shall the sword devour for ever knowest thou not that it will be bitterness in the latter end how long shall it be then ere thou bid the people return from following their brethren
2sm227 and joab said as god liveth unless thou hadst spoken surely then in the morning the people had gone up every one from following his brother
2sm228 so joab blew a trumpet and all the people stood still and pursued after israel no more neither fought they any more
2sm229 and abner and his men walked all that night through the plain and passed over jordan and went through all bithron and they came to mahanaim
2sm230 and joab returned from following abner and when he had gathered all the people together there lacked of david's servants nineteen men and asahel
2sm231 but the servants of david had smitten of benjamin and of abner's men so that three hundred and threescore men died
2sm232 and they took up asahel and buried him in the sepulchre of his father which was in bethlehem and joab and his men went all night and they came to hebron at break of day
2sm31 now there was long war between the house of saul and the house of david but david waxed stronger and stronger and the house of saul waxed weaker and weaker
2sm32 and unto david were sons born in hebron and his firstborn was amnon of ahinoam the jezreelitess
2sm33 and his second chileab of abigail the wife of nabal the carmelite and the third absalom the son of maacah the daughter of talmai king of geshur
2sm34 and the fourth adonijah the son of haggith and the fifth shephatiah the son of abital
2sm35 and the sixth ithream by eglah david's wife these were born to david in hebron
2sm36 and it came to pass while there was war between the house of saul and the house of david that abner made himself strong for the house of saul
2sm37 and saul had a concubine whose name was rizpah the daughter of aiah and ishbosheth said to abner wherefore hast thou gone in unto my father's concubine
2sm38 then was abner very wroth for the words of ishbosheth and said am i a dog's head which against judah do shew kindness this day unto the house of saul thy father to his brethren and to his friends and have not delivered thee into the hand of david that thou chargest me to day with a fault concerning this woman
2sm39 so do god to abner and more also except as the lord hath sworn to david even so i do to him
2sm310 to translate the kingdom from the house of saul and to set up the throne of david over israel and over judah from dan even to beersheba
2sm311 and he could not answer abner a word again because he feared him
2sm312 and abner sent messengers to david on his behalf saying whose is the land saying also make thy league with me and behold my hand shall be with thee to bring about all israel unto thee
2sm313 and he said well i will make a league with thee but one thing i require of thee that is thou shalt not see my face except thou first bring michal saul's daughter when thou comest to see my face
2sm314 and david sent messengers to ishbosheth saul's son saying deliver me my wife michal which i espoused to me for an hundred foreskins of the philistines
2sm315 and ishbosheth sent and took her from her husband even from phaltiel the son of laish
2sm316 and her husband went with her along weeping behind her to bahurim then said abner unto him go return and he returned
2sm317 and abner had communication with the elders of israel saying ye sought for david in times past to be king over you
2sm318 now then do it for the lord hath spoken of david saying by the hand of my servant david i will save my people israel out of the hand of the philistines and out of the hand of all their enemies
2sm319 and abner also spake in the ears of benjamin and abner went also to speak in the ears of david in hebron all that seemed good to israel and that seemed good to the whole house of benjamin
2sm320 so abner came to david to hebron and twenty men with him and david made abner and the men that were with him a feast
2sm321 and abner said unto david i will arise and go and will gather all israel unto my lord the king that they may make a league with thee and that thou mayest reign over all that thine heart desireth and david sent abner away and he went in peace
2sm322 and behold the servants of david and joab came from pursuing a troop and brought in a great spoil with them but abner was not with david in hebron for he had sent him away and he was gone in peace
2sm323 when joab and all the host that was with him were come they told joab saying abner the son of ner came to the king and he hath sent him away and he is gone in peace
2sm324 then joab came to the king and said what hast thou done behold abner came unto thee why is it that thou hast sent him away and he is quite gone
2sm325 thou knowest abner the son of ner that he came to deceive thee and to know thy going out and thy coming in and to know all that thou doest
2sm326 and when joab was come out from david he sent messengers after abner which brought him again from the well of sirah but david knew it not
2sm327 and when abner was returned to hebron joab took him aside in the gate to speak with him quietly and smote him there under the fifth rib that he died for the blood of asahel his brother
2sm328 and afterward when david heard it he said i and my kingdom are guiltless before the lord for ever from the blood of abner the son of ner
2sm329 let it rest on the head of joab and on all his father's house and let there not fail from the house of joab one that hath an issue or that is a leper or that leaneth on a staff or that falleth on the sword or that lacketh bread
2sm330 so joab and abishai his brother slew abner because he had slain their brother asahel at gibeon in the battle
2sm331 and david said to joab and to all the people that were with him rend your clothes and gird you with sackcloth and mourn before abner and king david himself followed the bier
2sm332 and they buried abner in hebron and the king lifted up his voice and wept at the grave of abner and all the people wept
2sm333 and the king lamented over abner and said died abner as a fool dieth
2sm334 thy hands were not bound nor thy feet put into fetters as a man falleth before wicked men so fellest thou and all the people wept again over him
2sm335 and when all the people came to cause david to eat meat while it was yet day david sware saying so do god to me and more also if i taste bread or ought else till the sun be down
2sm336 and all the people took notice of it and it pleased them as whatsoever the king did pleased all the people
2sm337 for all the people and all israel understood that day that it was not of the king to slay abner the son of ner
2sm338 and the king said unto his servants know ye not that there is a prince and a great man fallen this day in israel
2sm339 and i am this day weak though anointed king and these men the sons of zeruiah be too hard for me the lord shall reward the doer of evil according to his wickedness
2sm41 and when saul's son heard that abner was dead in hebron his hands were feeble and all the israelites were troubled
2sm42 and saul's son had two men that were captains of bands the name of the one was baanah and the name of the other rechab the sons of rimmon a beerothite of the children of benjamin for beeroth also was reckoned to benjamin
2sm43 and the beerothites fled to gittaim and were sojourners there until this day
2sm44 and jonathan saul's son had a son that was lame of his feet he was five years old when the tidings came of saul and jonathan out of jezreel and his nurse took him up and fled and it came to pass as she made haste to flee that he fell and became lame and his name was mephibosheth
2sm45 and the sons of rimmon the beerothite rechab and baanah went and came about the heat of the day to the house of ishbosheth who lay on a bed at noon
2sm46 and they came thither into the midst of the house as though they would have fetched wheat and they smote him under the fifth rib and rechab and baanah his brother escaped
2sm47 for when they came into the house he lay on his bed in his bedchamber and they smote him and slew him and beheaded him and took his head and gat them away through the plain all night
2sm48 and they brought the head of ishbosheth unto david to hebron and said to the king behold the head of ishbosheth the son of saul thine enemy which sought thy life and the lord hath avenged my lord the king this day of saul and of his seed
2sm49 and david answered rechab and baanah his brother the sons of rimmon the beerothite and said unto them as the lord liveth who hath redeemed my soul out of all adversity
2sm410 when one told me saying behold saul is dead thinking to have brought good tidings i took hold of him and slew him in ziklag who thought that i would have given him a reward for his tidings
2sm411 how much more when wicked men have slain a righteous person in his own house upon his bed shall i not therefore now require his blood of your hand and take you away from the earth
2sm412 and david commanded his young men and they slew them and cut off their hands and their feet and hanged them up over the pool in hebron but they took the head of ishbosheth and buried it in the sepulchre of abner in hebron
2sm51 then came all the tribes of israel to david unto hebron and spake saying behold we are thy bone and thy flesh
2sm52 also in time past when saul was king over us thou wast he that leddest out and broughtest in israel and the lord said to thee thou shalt feed my people israel and thou shalt be a captain over israel
2sm53 so all the elders of israel came to the king to hebron and king david made a league with them in hebron before the lord and they anointed david king over israel
2sm54 david was thirty years old when he began to reign and he reigned forty years
2sm55 in hebron he reigned over judah seven years and six months and in jerusalem he reigned thirty and three years over all israel and judah
2sm56 and the king and his men went to jerusalem unto the jebusites the inhabitants of the land which spake unto david saying except thou take away the blind and the lame thou shalt not come in hither thinking david cannot come in hither
2sm57 nevertheless david took the strong hold of zion the same is the city of david
2sm58 and david said on that day whosoever getteth up to the gutter and smiteth the jebusites and the lame and the blind that are hated of david's soul he shall be chief and captain wherefore they said the blind and the lame shall not come into the house
2sm59 so david dwelt in the fort and called it the city of david and david built round about from millo and inward
2sm510 and david went on and grew great and the lord god of hosts was with him
2sm511 and hiram king of tyre sent messengers to david and cedar trees and carpenters and masons and they built david an house
2sm512 and david perceived that the lord had established him king over israel and that he had exalted his kingdom for his people israel's sake
2sm513 and david took him more concubines and wives out of jerusalem after he was come from hebron and there were yet sons and daughters born to david
2sm514 and these be the names of those that were born unto him in jerusalem shammuah and shobab and nathan and solomon
2sm515 ibhar also and elishua and nepheg and japhia
2sm516 and elishama and eliada and eliphalet
2sm517 but when the philistines heard that they had anointed david king over israel all the philistines came up to seek david and david heard of it and went down to the hold
2sm518 the philistines also came and spread themselves in the valley of rephaim
2sm519 and david enquired of the lord saying shall i go up to the philistines wilt thou deliver them into mine hand and the lord said unto david go up for i will doubtless deliver the philistines into thine hand
2sm520 and david came to baalperazim and david smote them there and said the lord hath broken forth upon mine enemies before me as the breach of waters therefore he called the name of that place baalperazim
2sm521 and there they left their images and david and his men burned them
2sm522 and the philistines came up yet again and spread themselves in the valley of rephaim
2sm523 and when david enquired of the lord he said thou shalt not go up but fetch a compass behind them and come upon them over against the mulberry trees
2sm524 and let it be when thou hearest the sound of a going in the tops of the mulberry trees that then thou shalt bestir thyself for then shall the lord go out before thee to smite the host of the philistines
2sm525 and david did so as the lord had commanded him and smote the philistines from geba until thou come to gazer
2sm61 again david gathered together all the chosen men of israel thirty thousand
2sm62 and david arose and went with all the people that were with him from baale of judah to bring up from thence the ark of god whose name is called by the name of the lord of hosts that dwelleth between the cherubims
2sm63 and they set the ark of god upon a new cart and brought it out of the house of abinadab that was in gibeah and uzzah and ahio the sons of abinadab drave the new cart
2sm64 and they brought it out of the house of abinadab which was at gibeah accompanying the ark of god and ahio went before the ark
2sm65 and david and all the house of israel played before the lord on all manner of instruments made of fir wood even on harps and on psalteries and on timbrels and on cornets and on cymbals
2sm66 and when they came to nachon's threshingfloor uzzah put forth his hand to the ark of god and took hold of it for the oxen shook it
2sm67 and the anger of the lord was kindled against uzzah and god smote him there for his error and there he died by the ark of god
2sm68 and david was displeased because the lord had made a breach upon uzzah and he called the name of the place perezuzzah to this day
2sm69 and david was afraid of the lord that day and said how shall the ark of the lord come to me
2sm610 so david would not remove the ark of the lord unto him into the city of david but david carried it aside into the house of obededom the gittite
2sm611 and the ark of the lord continued in the house of obededom the gittite three months and the lord blessed obededom and all his household
2sm612 and it was told king david saying the lord hath blessed the house of obededom and all that pertaineth unto him because of the ark of god so david went and brought up the ark of god from the house of obededom into the city of david with gladness
2sm613 and it was so that when they that bare the ark of the lord had gone six paces he sacrificed oxen and fatlings
2sm614 and david danced before the lord with all his might and david was girded with a linen ephod
2sm615 so david and all the house of israel brought up the ark of the lord with shouting and with the sound of the trumpet
2sm616 and as the ark of the lord came into the city of david michal saul's daughter looked through a window and saw king david leaping and dancing before the lord and she despised him in her heart
2sm617 and they brought in the ark of the lord and set it in his place in the midst of the tabernacle that david had pitched for it and david offered burnt offerings and peace offerings before the lord
2sm618 and as soon as david had made an end of offering burnt offerings and peace offerings he blessed the people in the name of the lord of hosts
2sm619 and he dealt among all the people even among the whole multitude of israel as well to the women as men to every one a cake of bread and a good piece of flesh and a flagon of wine so all the people departed every one to his house
2sm620 then david returned to bless his household and michal the daughter of saul came out to meet david and said how glorious was the king of israel to day who uncovered himself to day in the eyes of the handmaids of his servants as one of the vain fellows shamelessly uncovereth himself
2sm621 and david said unto michal it was before the lord which chose me before thy father and before all his house to appoint me ruler over the people of the lord over israel therefore will i play before the lord
2sm622 and i will yet be more vile than thus and will be base in mine own sight and of the maidservants which thou hast spoken of of them shall i be had in honour
2sm623 therefore michal the daughter of saul had no child unto the day of her death
2sm71 and it came to pass when the king sat in his house and the lord had given him rest round about from all his enemies
2sm72 that the king said unto nathan the prophet see now i dwell in an house of cedar but the ark of god dwelleth within curtains
2sm73 and nathan said to the king go do all that is in thine heart for the lord is with thee
2sm74 and it came to pass that night that the word of the lord came unto nathan saying
2sm75 go and tell my servant david thus saith the lord shalt thou build me an house for me to dwell in
2sm76 whereas i have not dwelt in any house since the time that i brought up the children of israel out of egypt even to this day but have walked in a tent and in a tabernacle
2sm77 in all the places wherein i have walked with all the children of israel spake i a word with any of the tribes of israel whom i commanded to feed my people israel saying why build ye not me an house of cedar
2sm78 now therefore so shalt thou say unto my servant david thus saith the lord of hosts i took thee from the sheepcote from following the sheep to be ruler over my people over israel
2sm79 and i was with thee whithersoever thou wentest and have cut off all thine enemies out of thy sight and have made thee a great name like unto the name of the great men that are in the earth
2sm710 moreover i will appoint a place for my people israel and will plant them that they may dwell in a place of their own and move no more neither shall the children of wickedness afflict them any more as beforetime
2sm711 and as since the time that i commanded judges to be over my people israel and have caused thee to rest from all thine enemies also the lord telleth thee that he will make thee an house
2sm712 and when thy days be fulfilled and thou shalt sleep with thy fathers i will set up thy seed after thee which shall proceed out of thy bowels and i will establish his kingdom
2sm713 he shall build an house for my name and i will stablish the throne of his kingdom for ever
2sm714 i will be his father and he shall be my son if he commit iniquity i will chasten him with the rod of men and with the stripes of the children of men
2sm715 but my mercy shall not depart away from him as i took it from saul whom i put away before thee
2sm716 and thine house and thy kingdom shall be established for ever before thee thy throne shall be established for ever
2sm717 according to all these words and according to all this vision so did nathan speak unto david
