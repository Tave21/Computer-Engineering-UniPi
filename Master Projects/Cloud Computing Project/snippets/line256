 that death and nature do contend about them
 whether they live or die
macbeth within who's there what ho
lady macbeth alack i am afraid they have awaked
 and tis not done the attempt and not the deed
 confounds us hark i laid their daggers ready
 he could not miss em had he not resembled
 my father as he slept i had done't
 enter macbeth
 my husband
macbeth i have done the deed didst thou not hear a noise
lady macbeth i heard the owl scream and the crickets cry
 did not you speak
macbeth when
lady macbeth now
macbeth as i descended
lady macbeth ay
macbeth hark
 who lies i the second chamber
lady macbeth donalbain
macbeth this is a sorry sight
 looking on his hands
lady macbeth a foolish thought to say a sorry sight
macbeth there's one did laugh in's sleep and one cried
 murder'
 that they did wake each other i stood and heard them
 but they did say their prayers and address'd them
 again to sleep
lady macbeth there are two lodged together
macbeth one cried god bless us and amen the other
 as they had seen me with these hangman's hands
 listening their fear i could not say amen'
 when they did say god bless us'
lady macbeth consider it not so deeply
macbeth but wherefore could not i pronounce amen'
 i had most need of blessing and amen'
 stuck in my throat
lady macbeth these deeds must not be thought
 after these ways so it will make us mad
macbeth methought i heard a voice cry sleep no more
 macbeth does murder sleep the innocent sleep
 sleep that knits up the ravell'd sleeve of care
 the death of each day's life sore labour's bath
 balm of hurt minds great nature's second course
 chief nourisher in life's feast
lady macbeth what do you mean
macbeth still it cried sleep no more to all the house
 glamis hath murder'd sleep and therefore cawdor
 shall sleep no more macbeth shall sleep no more'
lady macbeth who was it that thus cried why worthy thane
 you do unbend your noble strength to think
 so brainsickly of things go get some water
 and wash this filthy witness from your hand
 why did you bring these daggers from the place
 they must lie there go carry them and smear
 the sleepy grooms with blood
macbeth i'll go no more
 i am afraid to think what i have done
 look on't again i dare not
lady macbeth infirm of purpose
 give me the daggers the sleeping and the dead
 are but as pictures tis the eye of childhood
 that fears a painted devil if he do bleed
 i'll gild the faces of the grooms withal
 for it must seem their guilt
 exit knocking within
macbeth whence is that knocking
 how is't with me when every noise appals me
 what hands are here ha they pluck out mine eyes
 will all great neptune's ocean wash this blood
 clean from my hand no this my hand will rather
 the multitudinous seas in incarnadine
 making the green one red

 enter macduff and lennox
macduff was it so late friend ere you went to bed
 that you do lie so late
porter faith sir we were carousing till the
 second cock and drink sir is a great
 provoker of three things
macduff what three things does drink especially provoke
porter marry sir nosepainting sleep and
 urine lechery sir it provokes and unprovokes
 it provokes the desire but it takes
 away the performance therefore much drink
 may be said to be an equivocator with lechery
 it makes him and it mars him it sets
 him on and it takes him off it persuades him
 and disheartens him makes him stand to and
 not stand to in conclusion equivocates him
 in a sleep and giving him the lie leaves him
macduff i believe drink gave thee the lie last night
porter that it did sir i the very throat on
 me but i requited him for his lie and i
 think being too strong for him though he took
 up my legs sometime yet i made a shift to cast
 him
macduff is thy master stirring
 enter macbeth
 our knocking has awaked him here he comes
lennox good morrow noble sir
macbeth good morrow both
macduff is the king stirring worthy thane
macbeth not yet
macduff he did command me to call timely on him
 i have almost slipp'd the hour
macbeth i'll bring you to him
macduff i know this is a joyful trouble to you
 but yet tis one
macbeth the labour we delight in physics pain
 this is the door
macduff i'll make so bold to call
 for tis my limited service
 exit
lennox goes the king hence today
macbeth he does he did appoint so
lennox the night has been unruly where we lay
 our chimneys were blown down and as they say
 lamentings heard i the air strange screams of death
 and prophesying with accents terrible
 of dire combustion and confused events
 new hatch'd to the woeful time the obscure bird
 clamour'd the livelong night some say the earth
 was feverous and did shake
macbeth twas a rough night
lennox my young remembrance cannot parallel
 a fellow to it
 reenter macduff
macduff o horror horror horror tongue nor heart
 cannot conceive nor name thee
macbeth 
 what's the matter
lennox 
macduff confusion now hath made his masterpiece
 most sacrilegious murder hath broke ope
 the lord's anointed temple and stole thence
 the life o the building
macbeth what is t you say the life
lennox mean you his majesty
macduff approach the chamber and destroy your sight
 with a new gorgon do not bid me speak
 see and then speak yourselves
 exeunt macbeth and lennox
 awake awake
 ring the alarumbell murder and treason
