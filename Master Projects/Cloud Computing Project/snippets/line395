 that never object pleasing in thine eye
 that never touch well welcome to thy hand
 that never meat sweetsavor'd in thy taste
 unless i spake or look'd or touch'd or carved to thee
 how comes it now my husband o how comes it
 that thou art thus estranged from thyself
 thyself i call it being strange to me
 that undividable incorporate
 am better than thy dear self's better part
 ah do not tear away thyself from me
 for know my love as easy mayest thou fall
 a drop of water in the breaking gulf
 and take unmingled that same drop again
 without addition or diminishing
 as take from me thyself and not me too
 how dearly would it touch me to the quick
 shouldst thou but hear i were licentious
 and that this body consecrate to thee
 by ruffian lust should be contaminate
 wouldst thou not spit at me and spurn at me
 and hurl the name of husband in my face
 and tear the stain'd skin off my harlotbrow
 and from my false hand cut the weddingring
 and break it with a deepdivorcing vow
 i know thou canst and therefore see thou do it
 i am possess'd with an adulterate blot
 my blood is mingled with the crime of lust
 for if we too be one and thou play false
 i do digest the poison of thy flesh
 being strumpeted by thy contagion
 keep then far league and truce with thy true bed
 i live unstain'd thou undishonoured
antipholus
of syracuse plead you to me fair dame i know you not
 in ephesus i am but two hours old
 as strange unto your town as to your talk
 who every word by all my wit being scann'd
 want wit in all one word to understand
luciana fie brother how the world is changed with you
 when were you wont to use my sister thus
 she sent for you by dromio home to dinner
antipholus
of syracuse by dromio
dromio of syracuse by me
adriana by thee and this thou didst return from him
 that he did buffet thee and in his blows
 denied my house for his me for his wife
antipholus
of syracuse did you converse sir with this gentlewoman
 what is the course and drift of your compact
dromio of syracuse i sir i never saw her till this time
antipholus
of syracuse villain thou liest for even her very words
 didst thou deliver to me on the mart
dromio of syracuse i never spake with her in all my life
antipholus
of syracuse how can she thus then call us by our names
 unless it be by inspiration
adriana how ill agrees it with your gravity
 to counterfeit thus grossly with your slave
 abetting him to thwart me in my mood
 be it my wrong you are from me exempt
 but wrong not that wrong with a more contempt
 come i will fasten on this sleeve of thine
 thou art an elm my husband i a vine
 whose weakness married to thy stronger state
 makes me with thy strength to communicate
 if aught possess thee from me it is dross
 usurping ivy brier or idle moss
 who all for want of pruning with intrusion
 infect thy sap and live on thy confusion
antipholus
of syracuse to me she speaks she moves me for her theme
 what was i married to her in my dream
 or sleep i now and think i hear all this
 what error drives our eyes and ears amiss
 until i know this sure uncertainty
 i'll entertain the offer'd fallacy
luciana dromio go bid the servants spread for dinner
dromio of syracuse o for my beads i cross me for a sinner
 this is the fairy land o spite of spites
 we talk with goblins owls and sprites
 if we obey them not this will ensue
 they'll suck our breath or pinch us black and blue
luciana why pratest thou to thyself and answer'st not
 dromio thou drone thou snail thou slug thou sot
dromio of syracuse i am transformed master am i not
antipholus
of syracuse i think thou art in mind and so am i
dromio of syracuse nay master both in mind and in my shape
antipholus
of syracuse thou hast thine own form
dromio of syracuse no i am an ape
luciana if thou art changed to aught tis to an ass
dromio of syracuse tis true she rides me and i long for grass
 tis so i am an ass else it could never be
 but i should know her as well as she knows me
adriana come come no longer will i be a fool
 to put the finger in the eye and weep
 whilst man and master laugh my woes to scorn
 come sir to dinner dromio keep the gate
 husband i'll dine above with you today
 and shrive you of a thousand idle pranks
 sirrah if any ask you for your master
 say he dines forth and let no creature enter
 come sister dromio play the porter well
antipholus
of syracuse am i in earth in heaven or in hell
 sleeping or waking mad or welladvised
 known unto these and to myself disguised
 i'll say as they say and persever so
 and in this mist at all adventures go
dromio of syracuse master shall i be porter at the gate
adriana ay and let none enter lest i break your pate
luciana come come antipholus we dine too late

 and charged him with a thousand marks in gold
 and that i did deny my wife and house
 thou drunkard thou what didst thou mean by this
dromio of ephesus say what you will sir but i know what i know
 that you beat me at the mart i have your hand to show
 if the skin were parchment and the blows you gave were ink
 your own handwriting would tell you what i think
antipholus
of ephesus i think thou art an ass
dromio of ephesus marry so it doth appear
 by the wrongs i suffer and the blows i bear
 i should kick being kick'd and being at that pass
 you would keep from my heels and beware of an ass
antipholus
of ephesus you're sad signior balthazar pray god our cheer
 may answer my good will and your good welcome here
balthazar i hold your dainties cheap sir and your
 welcome dear
antipholus
of ephesus o signior balthazar either at flesh or fish
 a table full of welcome make scarce one dainty dish
balthazar good meat sir is common that every churl affords
antipholus
of ephesus and welcome more common for that's nothing but words
balthazar small cheer and great welcome makes a merry feast
antipholus
of ephesus ay to a niggardly host and more sparing guest
