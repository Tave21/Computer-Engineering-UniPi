howl ye inhabitants of maktesh for all the merchant people are cut down all they that bear silver are cut off
and it shall come to pass at that time that i will search jerusalem with candles and punish the men that are settled on their lees that say in their heart the lord will not do good neither will he do evil
therefore their goods shall become a booty and their houses a desolation they shall also build houses but not inhabit them and they shall plant vineyards but not drink the wine thereof
the great day of the lord is near it is near and hasteth greatly even the voice of the day of the lord the mighty man shall cry there bitterly
that day is a day of wrath a day of trouble and distress a day of wasteness and desolation a day of darkness and gloominess a day of clouds and thick darkness
a day of the trumpet and alarm against the fenced cities and against the high towers
and i will bring distress upon men that they shall walk like blind men because they have sinned against the lord and their blood shall be poured out as dust and their flesh as the dung
neither their silver nor their gold shall be able to deliver them in the day of the lord's wrath but the whole land shall be devoured by the fire of his jealousy for he shall make even a speedy riddance of all them that dwell in the land
gather yourselves together yea gather together o nation not desired
before the decree bring forth before the day pass as the chaff before the fierce anger of the lord come upon you before the day of the lord's anger come upon you
seek ye the lord all ye meek of the earth which have wrought his judgment seek righteousness seek meekness it may be ye shall be hid in the day of the lord's anger
for gaza shall be forsaken and ashkelon a desolation they shall drive out ashdod at the noon day and ekron shall be rooted up
woe unto the inhabitants of the sea coast the nation of the cherethites the word of the lord is against you o canaan the land of the philistines i will even destroy thee that there shall be no inhabitant
and the sea coast shall be dwellings and cottages for shepherds and folds for flocks
and the coast shall be for the remnant of the house of judah they shall feed thereupon in the houses of ashkelon shall they lie down in the evening for the lord their god shall visit them and turn away their captivity
i have heard the reproach of moab and the revilings of the children of ammon whereby they have reproached my people and magnified themselves against their border
therefore as i live saith the lord of hosts the god of israel surely moab shall be as sodom and the children of ammon as gomorrah even the breeding of nettles and saltpits and a perpetual desolation the residue of my people shall spoil them and the remnant of my people shall possess them
this shall they have for their pride because they have reproached and magnified themselves against the people of the lord of hosts
the lord will be terrible unto them for he will famish all the gods of the earth and men shall worship him every one from his place even all the isles of the heathen
ye ethiopians also ye shall be slain by my sword
and he will stretch out his hand against the north and destroy assyria and will make nineveh a desolation and dry like a wilderness
and flocks shall lie down in the midst of her all the beasts of the nations both the cormorant and the bittern shall lodge in the upper lintels of it their voice shall sing in the windows desolation shall be in the thresholds for he shall uncover the cedar work
this is the rejoicing city that dwelt carelessly that said in her heart i am and there is none beside me how is she become a desolation a place for beasts to lie down in every one that passeth by her shall hiss and wag his hand
woe to her that is filthy and polluted to the oppressing city
she obeyed not the voice she received not correction she trusted not in the lord she drew not near to her god
her princes within her are roaring lions her judges are evening wolves they gnaw not the bones till the morrow
her prophets are light and treacherous persons her priests have polluted the sanctuary they have done violence to the law
the just lord is in the midst thereof he will not do iniquity every morning doth he bring his judgment to light he faileth not but the unjust knoweth no shame
i have cut off the nations their towers are desolate i made their streets waste that none passeth by their cities are destroyed so that there is no man that there is none inhabitant
i said surely thou wilt fear me thou wilt receive instruction so their dwelling should not be cut off howsoever i punished them but they rose early and corrupted all their doings
therefore wait ye upon me saith the lord until the day that i rise up to the prey for my determination is to gather the nations that i may assemble the kingdoms to pour upon them mine indignation even all my fierce anger for all the earth shall be devoured with the fire of my jealousy
for then will i turn to the people a pure language that they may all call upon the name of the lord to serve him with one consent
from beyond the rivers of ethiopia my suppliants even the daughter of my dispersed shall bring mine offering
in that day shalt thou not be ashamed for all thy doings wherein thou hast transgressed against me for then i will take away out of the midst of thee them that rejoice in thy pride and thou shalt no more be haughty because of my holy mountain
i will also leave in the midst of thee an afflicted and poor people and they shall trust in the name of the lord
the remnant of israel shall not do iniquity nor speak lies neither shall a deceitful tongue be found in their mouth for they shall feed and lie down and none shall make them afraid
sing o daughter of zion shout o israel be glad and rejoice with all the heart o daughter of jerusalem
the lord hath taken away thy judgments he hath cast out thine enemy the king of israel even the lord is in the midst of thee thou shalt not see evil any more
in that day it shall be said to jerusalem fear thou not and to zion let not thine hands be slack
the lord thy god in the midst of thee is mighty he will save he will rejoice over thee with joy he will rest in his love he will joy over thee with singing
i will gather them that are sorrowful for the solemn assembly who are of thee to whom the reproach of it was a burden
behold at that time i will undo all that afflict thee and i will save her that halteth and gather her that was driven out and i will get them praise and fame in every land where they have been put to shame
at that time will i bring you again even in the time that i gather you for i will make you a name and a praise among all people of the earth when i turn back your captivity before your eyes saith the lord
in the second year of darius the king in the sixth month in the first day of the month came the word of the lord by haggai the prophet unto zerubbabel the son of shealtiel governor of judah and to joshua the son of josedech the high priest saying
thus speaketh the lord of hosts saying this people say the time is not come the time that the lord's house should be built
then came the word of the lord by haggai the prophet saying
is it time for you o ye to dwell in your cieled houses and this house lie waste
now therefore thus saith the lord of hosts consider your ways
ye have sown much and bring in little ye eat but ye have not enough ye drink but ye are not filled with drink ye clothe you but there is none warm and he that earneth wages earneth wages to put it into a bag with holes
thus saith the lord of hosts consider your ways
go up to the mountain and bring wood and build the house and i will take pleasure in it and i will be glorified saith the lord
ye looked for much and lo it came to little and when ye brought it home i did blow upon it why saith the lord of hosts because of mine house that is waste and ye run every man unto his own house
therefore the heaven over you is stayed from dew and the earth is stayed from her fruit
and i called for a drought upon the land and upon the mountains and upon the corn and upon the new wine and upon the oil and upon that which the ground bringeth forth and upon men and upon cattle and upon all the labour of the hands
then zerubbabel the son of shealtiel and joshua the son of josedech the high priest with all the remnant of the people obeyed the voice of the lord their god and the words of haggai the prophet as the lord their god had sent him and the people did fear before the lord
then spake haggai the lord's messenger in the lord's message unto the people saying i am with you saith the lord
and the lord stirred up the spirit of zerubbabel the son of shealtiel governor of judah and the spirit of joshua the son of josedech the high priest and the spirit of all the remnant of the people and they came and did work in the house of the lord of hosts their god
in the four and twentieth day of the sixth month in the second year of darius the king
in the seventh month in the one and twentieth day of the month came the word of the lord by the prophet haggai saying
speak now to zerubbabel the son of shealtiel governor of judah and to joshua the son of josedech the high priest and to the residue of the people saying
who is left among you that saw this house in her first glory and how do ye see it now is it not in your eyes in comparison of it as nothing
yet now be strong o zerubbabel saith the lord and be strong o joshua son of josedech the high priest and be strong all ye people of the land saith the lord and work for i am with you saith the lord of hosts
according to the word that i covenanted with you when ye came out of egypt so my spirit remaineth among you fear ye not
for thus saith the lord of hosts yet once it is a little while and i will shake the heavens and the earth and the sea and the dry land
and i will shake all nations and the desire of all nations shall come and i will fill this house with glory saith the lord of hosts
the silver is mine and the gold is mine saith the lord of hosts
the glory of this latter house shall be greater than of the former saith the lord of hosts and in this place will i give peace saith the lord of hosts
in the four and twentieth day of the ninth month in the second year of darius came the word of the lord by haggai the prophet saying
thus saith the lord of hosts ask now the priests concerning the law saying
if one bear holy flesh in the skirt of his garment and with his skirt do touch bread or pottage or wine or oil or any meat shall it be holy and the priests answered and said no
then said haggai if one that is unclean by a dead body touch any of these shall it be unclean and the priests answered and said it shall be unclean
then answered haggai and said so is this people and so is this nation before me saith the lord and so is every work of their hands and that which they offer there is unclean
and now i pray you consider from this day and upward from before a stone was laid upon a stone in the temple of the lord
since those days were when one came to an heap of twenty measures there were but ten when one came to the pressfat for to draw out fifty vessels out of the press there were but twenty
i smote you with blasting and with mildew and with hail in all the labours of your hands yet ye turned not to me saith the lord
consider now from this day and upward from the four and twentieth day of the ninth month even from the day that the foundation of the lord's temple was laid consider it
is the seed yet in the barn yea as yet the vine and the fig tree and the pomegranate and the olive tree hath not brought forth from this day will i bless you
and again the word of the lord came unto haggai in the four and twentieth day of the month saying
speak to zerubbabel governor of judah saying i will shake the heavens and the earth
and i will overthrow the throne of kingdoms and i will destroy the strength of the kingdoms of the heathen and i will overthrow the chariots and those that ride in them and the horses and their riders shall come down every one by the sword of his brother
in that day saith the lord of hosts will i take thee o zerubbabel my servant the son of shealtiel saith the lord and will make thee as a signet for i have chosen thee saith the lord of hosts
in the eighth month in the second year of darius came the word of the lord unto zechariah the son of berechiah the son of iddo the prophet saying
the lord hath been sore displeased with your fathers
therefore say thou unto them thus saith the lord of hosts turn ye unto me saith the lord of hosts and i will turn unto you saith the lord of hosts
be ye not as your fathers unto whom the former prophets have cried saying thus saith the lord of hosts turn ye now from your evil ways and from your evil doings but they did not hear nor hearken unto me saith the lord
your fathers where are they and the prophets do they live for ever
but my words and my statutes which i commanded my servants the prophets did they not take hold of your fathers and they returned and said like as the lord of hosts thought to do unto us according to our ways and according to our doings so hath he dealt with us
upon the four and twentieth day of the eleventh month which is the month sebat in the second year of darius came the word of the lord unto zechariah the son of berechiah the son of iddo the prophet saying
i saw by night and behold a man riding upon a red horse and he stood among the myrtle trees that were in the bottom and behind him were there red horses speckled and white
then said i o my lord what are these and the angel that talked with me said unto me i will shew thee what these be
and the man that stood among the myrtle trees answered and said these are they whom the lord hath sent to walk to and fro through the earth
and they answered the angel of the lord that stood among the myrtle trees and said we have walked to and fro through the earth and behold all the earth sitteth still and is at rest
then the angel of the lord answered and said o lord of hosts how long wilt thou not have mercy on jerusalem and on the cities of judah against which thou hast had indignation these threescore and ten years
and the lord answered the angel that talked with me with good words and comfortable words
so the angel that communed with me said unto me cry thou saying thus saith the lord of hosts i am jealous for jerusalem and for zion with a great jealousy
and i am very sore displeased with the heathen that are at ease for i was but a little displeased and they helped forward the affliction
therefore thus saith the lord i am returned to jerusalem with mercies my house shall be built in it saith the lord of hosts and a line shall be stretched forth upon jerusalem
cry yet saying thus saith the lord of hosts my cities through prosperity shall yet be spread abroad and the lord shall yet comfort zion and shall yet choose jerusalem
then lifted i up mine eyes and saw and behold four horns
and i said unto the angel that talked with me what be these and he answered me these are the horns which have scattered judah israel and jerusalem
and the lord shewed me four carpenters
then said i what come these to do and he spake saying these are the horns which have scattered judah so that no man did lift up his head but these are come to fray them to cast out the horns of the gentiles which lifted up their horn over the land of judah to scatter it
i lifted up mine eyes again and looked and behold a man with a measuring line in his hand
then said i whither goest thou and he said unto me to measure jerusalem to see what is the breadth thereof and what is the length thereof
and behold the angel that talked with me went forth and another angel went out to meet him
and said unto him run speak to this young man saying jerusalem shall be inhabited as towns without walls for the multitude of men and cattle therein
for i saith the lord will be unto her a wall of fire round about and will be the glory in the midst of her
ho ho come forth and flee from the land of the north saith the lord for i have spread you abroad as the four winds of the heaven saith the lord
deliver thyself o zion that dwellest with the daughter of babylon
for thus saith the lord of hosts after the glory hath he sent me unto the nations which spoiled you for he that toucheth you toucheth the apple of his eye
for behold i will shake mine hand upon them and they shall be a spoil to their servants and ye shall know that the lord of hosts hath sent me
sing and rejoice o daughter of zion for lo i come and i will dwell in the midst of thee saith the lord
and many nations shall be joined to the lord in that day and shall be my people and i will dwell in the midst of thee and thou shalt know that the lord of hosts hath sent me unto thee
and the lord shall inherit judah his portion in the holy land and shall choose jerusalem again
be silent o all flesh before the lord for he is raised up out of his holy habitation
and he shewed me joshua the high priest standing before the angel of the lord and satan standing at his right hand to resist him
and the lord said unto satan the lord rebuke thee o satan even the lord that hath chosen jerusalem rebuke thee is not this a brand plucked out of the fire
now joshua was clothed with filthy garments and stood before the angel
and he answered and spake unto those that stood before him saying take away the filthy garments from him and unto him he said behold i have caused thine iniquity to pass from thee and i will clothe thee with change of raiment
and i said let them set a fair mitre upon his head so they set a fair mitre upon his head and clothed him with garments and the angel of the lord stood by
and the angel of the lord protested unto joshua saying
thus saith the lord of hosts if thou wilt walk in my ways and if thou wilt keep my charge then thou shalt also judge my house and shalt also keep my courts and i will give thee places to walk among these that stand by
hear now o joshua the high priest thou and thy fellows that sit before thee for they are men wondered at for behold i will bring forth my servant the branch
for behold the stone that i have laid before joshua upon one stone shall be seven eyes behold i will engrave the graving thereof saith the lord of hosts and i will remove the iniquity of that land in one day
in that day saith the lord of hosts shall ye call every man his neighbour under the vine and under the fig tree
and the angel that talked with me came again and waked me as a man that is wakened out of his sleep
and said unto me what seest thou and i said i have looked and behold a candlestick all of gold with a bowl upon the top of it and his seven lamps thereon and seven pipes to the seven lamps which are upon the top thereof
and two olive trees by it one upon the right side of the bowl and the other upon the left side thereof
so i answered and spake to the angel that talked with me saying what are these my lord
then the angel that talked with me answered and said unto me knowest thou not what these be and i said no my lord
then he answered and spake unto me saying this is the word of the lord unto zerubbabel saying not by might nor by power but by my spirit saith the lord of hosts
who art thou o great mountain before zerubbabel thou shalt become a plain and he shall bring forth the headstone thereof with shoutings crying grace grace unto it
moreover the word of the lord came unto me saying
the hands of zerubbabel have laid the foundation of this house his hands shall also finish it and thou shalt know that the lord of hosts hath sent me unto you
for who hath despised the day of small things for they shall rejoice and shall see the plummet in the hand of zerubbabel with those seven they are the eyes of the lord which run to and fro through the whole earth
then answered i and said unto him what are these two olive trees upon the right side of the candlestick and upon the left side thereof
and i answered again and said unto him what be these two olive branches which through the two golden pipes empty the golden oil out of themselves
and he answered me and said knowest thou not what these be and i said no my lord
then said he these are the two anointed ones that stand by the lord of the whole earth
then i turned and lifted up mine eyes and looked and behold a flying roll
and he said unto me what seest thou and i answered i see a flying roll the length thereof is twenty cubits and the breadth thereof ten cubits
then said he unto me this is the curse that goeth forth over the face of the whole earth for every one that stealeth shall be cut off as on this side according to it and every one that sweareth shall be cut off as on that side according to it
i will bring it forth saith the lord of hosts and it shall enter into the house of the thief and into the house of him that sweareth falsely by my name and it shall remain in the midst of his house and shall consume it with the timber thereof and the stones thereof
then the angel that talked with me went forth and said unto me lift up now thine eyes and see what is this that goeth forth
and i said what is it and he said this is an ephah that goeth forth he said moreover this is their resemblance through all the earth
and behold there was lifted up a talent of lead and this is a woman that sitteth in the midst of the ephah
and he said this is wickedness and he cast it into the midst of the ephah and he cast the weight of lead upon the mouth thereof
then lifted i up mine eyes and looked and behold there came out two women and the wind was in their wings for they had wings like the wings of a stork and they lifted up the ephah between the earth and the heaven
then said i to the angel that talked with me whither do these bear the ephah
and he said unto me to build it an house in the land of shinar and it shall be established and set there upon her own base
and i turned and lifted up mine eyes and looked and behold there came four chariots out from between two mountains and the mountains were mountains of brass
in the first chariot were red horses and in the second chariot black horses
and in the third chariot white horses and in the fourth chariot grisled and bay horses
then i answered and said unto the angel that talked with me what are these my lord
and the angel answered and said unto me these are the four spirits of the heavens which go forth from standing before the lord of all the earth
the black horses which are therein go forth into the north country and the white go forth after them and the grisled go forth toward the south country
and the bay went forth and sought to go that they might walk to and fro through the earth and he said get you hence walk to and fro through the earth so they walked to and fro through the earth
then cried he upon me and spake unto me saying behold these that go toward the north country have quieted my spirit in the north country
and the word of the lord came unto me saying
take of them of the captivity even of heldai of tobijah and of jedaiah which are come from babylon and come thou the same day and go into the house of josiah the son of zephaniah
then take silver and gold and make crowns and set them upon the head of joshua the son of josedech the high priest
and speak unto him saying thus speaketh the lord of hosts saying behold the man whose name is the branch and he shall grow up out of his place and he shall build the temple of the lord
even he shall build the temple of the lord and he shall bear the glory and shall sit and rule upon his throne and he shall be a priest upon his throne and the counsel of peace shall be between them both
and the crowns shall be to helem and to tobijah and to jedaiah and to hen the son of zephaniah for a memorial in the temple of the lord
and they that are far off shall come and build in the temple of the lord and ye shall know that the lord of hosts hath sent me unto you and this shall come to pass if ye will diligently obey the voice of the lord your god
and it came to pass in the fourth year of king darius that the word of the lord came unto zechariah in the fourth day of the ninth month even in chisleu
when they had sent unto the house of god sherezer and regemmelech and their men to pray before the lord
and to speak unto the priests which were in the house of the lord of hosts and to the prophets saying should i weep in the fifth month separating myself as i have done these so many years
then came the word of the lord of hosts unto me saying
speak unto all the people of the land and to the priests saying when ye fasted and mourned in the fifth and seventh month even those seventy years did ye at all fast unto me even to me
and when ye did eat and when ye did drink did not ye eat for yourselves and drink for yourselves
should ye not hear the words which the lord hath cried by the former prophets when jerusalem was inhabited and in prosperity and the cities thereof round about her when men inhabited the south and the plain
and the word of the lord came unto zechariah saying
thus speaketh the lord of hosts saying execute true judgment and shew mercy and compassions every man to his brother
and oppress not the widow nor the fatherless the stranger nor the poor and let none of you imagine evil against his brother in your heart
but they refused to hearken and pulled away the shoulder and stopped their ears that they should not hear
yea they made their hearts as an adamant stone lest they should hear the law and the words which the lord of hosts hath sent in his spirit by the former prophets therefore came a great wrath from the lord of hosts
therefore it is come to pass that as he cried and they would not hear so they cried and i would not hear saith the lord of hosts
but i scattered them with a whirlwind among all the nations whom they knew not thus the land was desolate after them that no man passed through nor returned for they laid the pleasant land desolate
again the word of the lord of hosts came to me saying
thus saith the lord of hosts i was jealous for zion with great jealousy and i was jealous for her with great fury
thus saith the lord i am returned unto zion and will dwell in the midst of jerusalem and jerusalem shall be called a city of truth and the mountain of the lord of hosts the holy mountain
thus saith the lord of hosts there shall yet old men and old women dwell in the streets of jerusalem and every man with his staff in his hand for very age
and the streets of the city shall be full of boys and girls playing in the streets thereof
thus saith the lord of hosts if it be marvellous in the eyes of the remnant of this people in these days should it also be marvellous in mine eyes saith the lord of hosts
thus saith the lord of hosts behold i will save my people from the east country and from the west country
and i will bring them and they shall dwell in the midst of jerusalem and they shall be my people and i will be their god in truth and in righteousness
thus saith the lord of hosts let your hands be strong ye that hear in these days these words by the mouth of the prophets which were in the day that the foundation of the house of the lord of hosts was laid that the temple might be built
for before these days there was no hire for man nor any hire for beast neither was there any peace to him that went out or came in because of the affliction for i set all men every one against his neighbour
but now i will not be unto the residue of this people as in the former days saith the lord of hosts
for the seed shall be prosperous the vine shall give her fruit and the ground shall give her increase and the heavens shall give their dew and i will cause the remnant of this people to possess all these things
and it shall come to pass that as ye were a curse among the heathen o house of judah and house of israel so will i save you and ye shall be a blessing fear not but let your hands be strong
for thus saith the lord of hosts as i thought to punish you when your fathers provoked me to wrath saith the lord of hosts and i repented not
so again have i thought in these days to do well unto jerusalem and to the house of judah fear ye not
these are the things that ye shall do speak ye every man the truth to his neighbour execute the judgment of truth and peace in your gates
and let none of you imagine evil in your hearts against his neighbour and love no false oath for all these are things that i hate saith the lord
and the word of the lord of hosts came unto me saying
thus saith the lord of hosts the fast of the fourth month and the fast of the fifth and the fast of the seventh and the fast of the tenth shall be to the house of judah joy and gladness and cheerful feasts therefore love the truth and peace
thus saith the lord of hosts it shall yet come to pass that there shall come people and the inhabitants of many cities
and the inhabitants of one city shall go to another saying let us go speedily to pray before the lord and to seek the lord of hosts i will go also
