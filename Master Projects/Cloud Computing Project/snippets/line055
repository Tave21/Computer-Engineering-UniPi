1chr2324 these were the sons of levi after the house of their fathers even the chief of the fathers as they were counted by number of names by their polls that did the work for the service of the house of the lord from the age of twenty years and upward
1chr2325 for david said the lord god of israel hath given rest unto his people that they may dwell in jerusalem for ever
1chr2326 and also unto the levites they shall no more carry the tabernacle nor any vessels of it for the service thereof
1chr2327 for by the last words of david the levites were numbered from twenty years old and above
1chr2328 because their office was to wait on the sons of aaron for the service of the house of the lord in the courts and in the chambers and in the purifying of all holy things and the work of the service of the house of god
1chr2329 both for the shewbread and for the fine flour for meat offering and for the unleavened cakes and for that which is baked in the pan and for that which is fried and for all manner of measure and size
1chr2330 and to stand every morning to thank and praise the lord and likewise at even
1chr2331 and to offer all burnt sacrifices unto the lord in the sabbaths in the new moons and on the set feasts by number according to the order commanded unto them continually before the lord
1chr2332 and that they should keep the charge of the tabernacle of the congregation and the charge of the holy place and the charge of the sons of aaron their brethren in the service of the house of the lord
1chr241 now these are the divisions of the sons of aaron the sons of aaron nadab and abihu eleazar and ithamar
1chr242 but nadab and abihu died before their father and had no children therefore eleazar and ithamar executed the priest's office
1chr243 and david distributed them both zadok of the sons of eleazar and ahimelech of the sons of ithamar according to their offices in their service
1chr244 and there were more chief men found of the sons of eleazar than of the sons of ithamar and thus were they divided among the sons of eleazar there were sixteen chief men of the house of their fathers and eight among the sons of ithamar according to the house of their fathers
1chr245 thus were they divided by lot one sort with another for the governors of the sanctuary and governors of the house of god were of the sons of eleazar and of the sons of ithamar
1chr246 and shemaiah the son of nethaneel the scribe one of the levites wrote them before the king and the princes and zadok the priest and ahimelech the son of abiathar and before the chief of the fathers of the priests and levites one principal household being taken for eleazar and one taken for ithamar

1chr256 all these were under the hands of their father for song in the house of the lord with cymbals psalteries and harps for the service of the house of god according to the king's order to asaph jeduthun and heman

1chr282 then david the king stood up upon his feet and said hear me my brethren and my people as for me i had in mine heart to build an house of rest for the ark of the covenant of the lord and for the footstool of our god and had made ready for the building
1chr283 but god said unto me thou shalt not build an house for my name because thou hast been a man of war and hast shed blood
1chr284 howbeit the lord god of israel chose me before all the house of my father to be king over israel for ever for he hath chosen judah to be the ruler and of the house of judah the house of my father and among the sons of my father he liked me to make me king over all israel
1chr285 and of all my sons for the lord hath given me many sons he hath chosen solomon my son to sit upon the throne of the kingdom of the lord over israel
1chr286 and he said unto me solomon thy son he shall build my house and my courts for i have chosen him to be my son and i will be his father

1chr289 and thou solomon my son know thou the god of thy father and serve him with a perfect heart and with a willing mind for the lord searcheth all hearts and understandeth all the imaginations of the thoughts if thou seek him he will be found of thee but if thou forsake him he will cast thee off for ever
1chr2810 take heed now for the lord hath chosen thee to build an house for the sanctuary be strong and do it
1chr2811 then david gave to solomon his son the pattern of the porch and of the houses thereof and of the treasuries thereof and of the upper chambers thereof and of the inner parlours thereof and of the place of the mercy seat

1chr2819 all this said david the lord made me understand in writing by his hand upon me even all the works of this pattern
1chr2820 and david said to solomon his son be strong and of good courage and do it fear not nor be dismayed for the lord god even my god will be with thee he will not fail thee nor forsake thee until thou hast finished all the work for the service of the house of the lord
1chr2821 and behold the courses of the priests and the levites even they shall be with thee for all the service of the house of god and there shall be with thee for all manner of workmanship every willing skilful man for any manner of service also the princes and all the people will be wholly at thy commandment
1chr291 furthermore david the king said unto all the congregation solomon my son whom alone god hath chosen is yet young and tender and the work is great for the palace is not for man but for the lord god
1chr292 now i have prepared with all my might for the house of my god the gold for things to be made of gold and the silver for things of silver and the brass for things of brass the iron for things of iron and wood for things of wood onyx stones and stones to be set glistering stones and of divers colours and all manner of precious stones and marble stones in abundance
1chr293 moreover because i have set my affection to the house of my god i have of mine own proper good of gold and silver which i have given to the house of my god over and above all that i have prepared for the holy house
1chr294 even three thousand talents of gold of the gold of ophir and seven thousand talents of refined silver to overlay the walls of the houses withal
1chr295 the gold for things of gold and the silver for things of silver and for all manner of work to be made by the hands of artificers and who then is willing to consecrate his service this day unto the lord
1chr296 then the chief of the fathers and princes of the tribes of israel and the captains of thousands and of hundreds with the rulers of the king's work offered willingly
1chr297 and gave for the service of the house of god of gold five thousand talents and ten thousand drams and of silver ten thousand talents and of brass eighteen thousand talents and one hundred thousand talents of iron
1chr298 and they with whom precious stones were found gave them to the treasure of the house of the lord by the hand of jehiel the gershonite
1chr299 then the people rejoiced for that they offered willingly because with perfect heart they offered willingly to the lord and david the king also rejoiced with great joy
1chr2910 wherefore david blessed the lord before all the congregation and david said blessed be thou lord god of israel our father for ever and ever
1chr2911 thine o lord is the greatness and the power and the glory and the victory and the majesty for all that is in the heaven and in the earth is thine thine is the kingdom o lord and thou art exalted as head above all
1chr2912 both riches and honour come of thee and thou reignest over all and in thine hand is power and might and in thine hand it is to make great and to give strength unto all
1chr2913 now therefore our god we thank thee and praise thy glorious name
1chr2914 but who am i and what is my people that we should be able to offer so willingly after this sort for all things come of thee and of thine own have we given thee
1chr2915 for we are strangers before thee and sojourners as were all our fathers our days on the earth are as a shadow and there is none abiding
1chr2916 o lord our god all this store that we have prepared to build thee an house for thine holy name cometh of thine hand and is all thine own
1chr2917 i know also my god that thou triest the heart and hast pleasure in uprightness as for me in the uprightness of mine heart i have willingly offered all these things and now have i seen with joy thy people which are present here to offer willingly unto thee
1chr2918 o lord god of abraham isaac and of israel our fathers keep this for ever in the imagination of the thoughts of the heart of thy people and prepare their heart unto thee
1chr2919 and give unto solomon my son a perfect heart to keep thy commandments thy testimonies and thy statutes and to do all these things and to build the palace for the which i have made provision
1chr2920 and david said to all the congregation now bless the lord your god and all the congregation blessed the lord god of their fathers and bowed down their heads and worshipped the lord and the king
1chr2921 and they sacrificed sacrifices unto the lord and offered burnt offerings unto the lord on the morrow after that day even a thousand bullocks a thousand rams and a thousand lambs with their drink offerings and sacrifices in abundance for all israel
1chr2922 and did eat and drink before the lord on that day with great gladness and they made solomon the son of david king the second time and anointed him unto the lord to be the chief governor and zadok to be priest
1chr2923 then solomon sat on the throne of the lord as king instead of david his father and prospered and all israel obeyed him
1chr2924 and all the princes and the mighty men and all the sons likewise of king david submitted themselves unto solomon the king
1chr2925 and the lord magnified solomon exceedingly in the sight of all israel and bestowed upon him such royal majesty as had not been on any king before him in israel
1chr2926 thus david the son of jesse reigned over all israel
1chr2927 and the time that he reigned over israel was forty years seven years reigned he in hebron and thirty and three years reigned he in jerusalem
1chr2928 and he died in a good old age full of days riches and honour and solomon his son reigned in his stead
1chr2929 now the acts of david the king first and last behold they are written in the book of samuel the seer and in the book of nathan the prophet and in the book of gad the seer
1chr2930 with all his reign and his might and the times that went over him and over israel and over all the kingdoms of the countries
2chr11 and solomon the son of david was strengthened in his kingdom and the lord his god was with him and magnified him exceedingly
2chr12 then solomon spake unto all israel to the captains of thousands and of hundreds and to the judges and to every governor in all israel the chief of the fathers
2chr13 so solomon and all the congregation with him went to the high place that was at gibeon for there was the tabernacle of the congregation of god which moses the servant of the lord had made in the wilderness
