1ki228 then tidings came to joab for joab had turned after adonijah though he turned not after absalom and joab fled unto the tabernacle of the lord and caught hold on the horns of the altar
1ki229 and it was told king solomon that joab was fled unto the tabernacle of the lord and behold he is by the altar then solomon sent benaiah the son of jehoiada saying go fall upon him
1ki230 and benaiah came to the tabernacle of the lord and said unto him thus saith the king come forth and he said nay but i will die here and benaiah brought the king word again saying thus said joab and thus he answered me
1ki231 and the king said unto him do as he hath said and fall upon him and bury him that thou mayest take away the innocent blood which joab shed from me and from the house of my father
1ki232 and the lord shall return his blood upon his own head who fell upon two men more righteous and better than he and slew them with the sword my father david not knowing thereof to wit abner the son of ner captain of the host of israel and amasa the son of jether captain of the host of judah
1ki233 their blood shall therefore return upon the head of joab and upon the head of his seed for ever but upon david and upon his seed and upon his house and upon his throne shall there be peace for ever from the lord
1ki234 so benaiah the son of jehoiada went up and fell upon him and slew him and he was buried in his own house in the wilderness
1ki235 and the king put benaiah the son of jehoiada in his room over the host and zadok the priest did the king put in the room of abiathar
1ki236 and the king sent and called for shimei and said unto him build thee an house in jerusalem and dwell there and go not forth thence any whither
1ki237 for it shall be that on the day thou goest out and passest over the brook kidron thou shalt know for certain that thou shalt surely die thy blood shall be upon thine own head
1ki238 and shimei said unto the king the saying is good as my lord the king hath said so will thy servant do and shimei dwelt in jerusalem many days
1ki239 and it came to pass at the end of three years that two of the servants of shimei ran away unto achish son of maachah king of gath and they told shimei saying behold thy servants be in gath
1ki240 and shimei arose and saddled his ass and went to gath to achish to seek his servants and shimei went and brought his servants from gath
1ki241 and it was told solomon that shimei had gone from jerusalem to gath and was come again
1ki242 and the king sent and called for shimei and said unto him did i not make thee to swear by the lord and protested unto thee saying know for a certain on the day thou goest out and walkest abroad any whither that thou shalt surely die and thou saidst unto me the word that i have heard is good
1ki243 why then hast thou not kept the oath of the lord and the commandment that i have charged thee with
1ki244 the king said moreover to shimei thou knowest all the wickedness which thine heart is privy to that thou didst to david my father therefore the lord shall return thy wickedness upon thine own head
1ki245 and king solomon shall be blessed and the throne of david shall be established before the lord for ever
1ki246 so the king commanded benaiah the son of jehoiada which went out and fell upon him that he died and the kingdom was established in the hand of solomon
1ki31 and solomon made affinity with pharaoh king of egypt and took pharaoh's daughter and brought her into the city of david until he had made an end of building his own house and the house of the lord and the wall of jerusalem round about
1ki32 only the people sacrificed in high places because there was no house built unto the name of the lord until those days
1ki33 and solomon loved the lord walking in the statutes of david his father only he sacrificed and burnt incense in high places
1ki34 and the king went to gibeon to sacrifice there for that was the great high place a thousand burnt offerings did solomon offer upon that altar
1ki35 in gibeon the lord appeared to solomon in a dream by night and god said ask what i shall give thee
1ki36 and solomon said thou hast shewed unto thy servant david my father great mercy according as he walked before thee in truth and in righteousness and in uprightness of heart with thee and thou hast kept for him this great kindness that thou hast given him a son to sit on his throne as it is this day
1ki37 and now o lord my god thou hast made thy servant king instead of david my father and i am but a little child i know not how to go out or come in
1ki38 and thy servant is in the midst of thy people which thou hast chosen a great people that cannot be numbered nor counted for multitude
1ki39 give therefore thy servant an understanding heart to judge thy people that i may discern between good and bad for who is able to judge this thy so great a people
1ki310 and the speech pleased the lord that solomon had asked this thing
1ki311 and god said unto him because thou hast asked this thing and hast not asked for thyself long life neither hast asked riches for thyself nor hast asked the life of thine enemies but hast asked for thyself understanding to discern judgment
1ki312 behold i have done according to thy words lo i have given thee a wise and an understanding heart so that there was none like thee before thee neither after thee shall any arise like unto thee
1ki313 and i have also given thee that which thou hast not asked both riches and honour so that there shall not be any among the kings like unto thee all thy days
1ki314 and if thou wilt walk in my ways to keep my statutes and my commandments as thy father david did walk then i will lengthen thy days
1ki315 and solomon awoke and behold it was a dream and he came to jerusalem and stood before the ark of the covenant of the lord and offered up burnt offerings and offered peace offerings and made a feast to all his servants
1ki316 then came there two women that were harlots unto the king and stood before him
1ki317 and the one woman said o my lord i and this woman dwell in one house and i was delivered of a child with her in the house
1ki318 and it came to pass the third day after that i was delivered that this woman was delivered also and we were together there was no stranger with us in the house save we two in the house
1ki319 and this woman's child died in the night because she overlaid it
1ki320 and she arose at midnight and took my son from beside me while thine handmaid slept and laid it in her bosom and laid her dead child in my bosom
1ki321 and when i rose in the morning to give my child suck behold it was dead but when i had considered it in the morning behold it was not my son which i did bear
1ki322 and the other woman said nay but the living is my son and the dead is thy son and this said no but the dead is thy son and the living is my son thus they spake before the king
1ki323 then said the king the one saith this is my son that liveth and thy son is the dead and the other saith nay but thy son is the dead and my son is the living
1ki324 and the king said bring me a sword and they brought a sword before the king
1ki325 and the king said divide the living child in two and give half to the one and half to the other
1ki326 then spake the woman whose the living child was unto the king for her bowels yearned upon her son and she said o my lord give her the living child and in no wise slay it but the other said let it be neither mine nor thine but divide it
1ki327 then the king answered and said give her the living child and in no wise slay it she is the mother thereof
1ki328 and all israel heard of the judgment which the king had judged and they feared the king for they saw that the wisdom of god was in him to do judgment
1ki41 so king solomon was king over all israel
1ki42 and these were the princes which he had azariah the son of zadok the priest
1ki43 elihoreph and ahiah the sons of shisha scribes jehoshaphat the son of ahilud the recorder
1ki44 and benaiah the son of jehoiada was over the host and zadok and abiathar were the priests
1ki45 and azariah the son of nathan was over the officers and zabud the son of nathan was principal officer and the king's friend
1ki46 and ahishar was over the household and adoniram the son of abda was over the tribute
1ki47 and solomon had twelve officers over all israel which provided victuals for the king and his household each man his month in a year made provision
1ki48 and these are their names the son of hur in mount ephraim
1ki49 the son of dekar in makaz and in shaalbim and bethshemesh and elonbethhanan
1ki410 the son of hesed in aruboth to him pertained sochoh and all the land of hepher
1ki411 the son of abinadab in all the region of dor which had taphath the daughter of solomon to wife
1ki412 baana the son of ahilud to him pertained taanach and megiddo and all bethshean which is by zartanah beneath jezreel from bethshean to abelmeholah even unto the place that is beyond jokneam
1ki413 the son of geber in ramothgilead to him pertained the towns of jair the son of manasseh which are in gilead to him also pertained the region of argob which is in bashan threescore great cities with walls and brasen bars
1ki414 ahinadab the son of iddo had mahanaim
1ki415 ahimaaz was in naphtali he also took basmath the daughter of solomon to wife
1ki416 baanah the son of hushai was in asher and in aloth
1ki417 jehoshaphat the son of paruah in issachar
1ki418 shimei the son of elah in benjamin
1ki419 geber the son of uri was in the country of gilead in the country of sihon king of the amorites and of og king of bashan and he was the only officer which was in the land
1ki420 judah and israel were many as the sand which is by the sea in multitude eating and drinking and making merry
1ki421 and solomon reigned over all kingdoms from the river unto the land of the philistines and unto the border of egypt they brought presents and served solomon all the days of his life
1ki422 and solomon's provision for one day was thirty measures of fine flour and threescore measures of meal
1ki423 ten fat oxen and twenty oxen out of the pastures and an hundred sheep beside harts and roebucks and fallowdeer and fatted fowl
1ki424 for he had dominion over all the region on this side the river from tiphsah even to azzah over all the kings on this side the river and he had peace on all sides round about him
1ki425 and judah and israel dwelt safely every man under his vine and under his fig tree from dan even to beersheba all the days of solomon
1ki426 and solomon had forty thousand stalls of horses for his chariots and twelve thousand horsemen
1ki427 and those officers provided victual for king solomon and for all that came unto king solomon's table every man in his month they lacked nothing
1ki428 barley also and straw for the horses and dromedaries brought they unto the place where the officers were every man according to his charge
1ki429 and god gave solomon wisdom and understanding exceeding much and largeness of heart even as the sand that is on the sea shore
1ki430 and solomon's wisdom excelled the wisdom of all the children of the east country and all the wisdom of egypt
1ki431 for he was wiser than all men than ethan the ezrahite and heman and chalcol and darda the sons of mahol and his fame was in all nations round about
1ki432 and he spake three thousand proverbs and his songs were a thousand and five
1ki433 and he spake of trees from the cedar tree that is in lebanon even unto the hyssop that springeth out of the wall he spake also of beasts and of fowl and of creeping things and of fishes
1ki434 and there came of all people to hear the wisdom of solomon from all kings of the earth which had heard of his wisdom
1ki51 and hiram king of tyre sent his servants unto solomon for he had heard that they had anointed him king in the room of his father for hiram was ever a lover of david
1ki52 and solomon sent to hiram saying
1ki53 thou knowest how that david my father could not build an house unto the name of the lord his god for the wars which were about him on every side until the lord put them under the soles of his feet
1ki54 but now the lord my god hath given me rest on every side so that there is neither adversary nor evil occurrent
1ki55 and behold i purpose to build an house unto the name of the lord my god as the lord spake unto david my father saying thy son whom i will set upon thy throne in thy room he shall build an house unto my name
1ki56 now therefore command thou that they hew me cedar trees out of lebanon and my servants shall be with thy servants and unto thee will i give hire for thy servants according to all that thou shalt appoint for thou knowest that there is not among us any that can skill to hew timber like unto the sidonians
1ki57 and it came to pass when hiram heard the words of solomon that he rejoiced greatly and said blessed be the lord this day which hath given unto david a wise son over this great people
1ki58 and hiram sent to solomon saying i have considered the things which thou sentest to me for and i will do all thy desire concerning timber of cedar and concerning timber of fir
1ki59 my servants shall bring them down from lebanon unto the sea and i will convey them by sea in floats unto the place that thou shalt appoint me and will cause them to be discharged there and thou shalt receive them and thou shalt accomplish my desire in giving food for my household
1ki510 so hiram gave solomon cedar trees and fir trees according to all his desire
1ki511 and solomon gave hiram twenty thousand measures of wheat for food to his household and twenty measures of pure oil thus gave solomon to hiram year by year
1ki512 and the lord gave solomon wisdom as he promised him and there was peace between hiram and solomon and they two made a league together
1ki513 and king solomon raised a levy out of all israel and the levy was thirty thousand men
1ki514 and he sent them to lebanon ten thousand a month by courses a month they were in lebanon and two months at home and adoniram was over the levy
1ki515 and solomon had threescore and ten thousand that bare burdens and fourscore thousand hewers in the mountains
1ki516 beside the chief of solomon's officers which were over the work three thousand and three hundred which ruled over the people that wrought in the work
1ki517 and the king commanded and they brought great stones costly stones and hewed stones to lay the foundation of the house
1ki518 and solomon's builders and hiram's builders did hew them and the stonesquarers so they prepared timber and stones to build the house
1ki61 and it came to pass in the four hundred and eightieth year after the children of israel were come out of the land of egypt in the fourth year of solomon's reign over israel in the month zif which is the second month that he began to build the house of the lord
1ki62 and the house which king solomon built for the lord the length thereof was threescore cubits and the breadth thereof twenty cubits and the height thereof thirty cubits
1ki63 and the porch before the temple of the house twenty cubits was the length thereof according to the breadth of the house and ten cubits was the breadth thereof before the house
1ki64 and for the house he made windows of narrow lights
1ki65 and against the wall of the house he built chambers round about against the walls of the house round about both of the temple and of the oracle and he made chambers round about
1ki66 the nethermost chamber was five cubits broad and the middle was six cubits broad and the third was seven cubits broad for without in the wall of the house he made narrowed rests round about that the beams should not be fastened in the walls of the house
1ki67 and the house when it was in building was built of stone made ready before it was brought thither so that there was neither hammer nor axe nor any tool of iron heard in the house while it was in building
1ki68 the door for the middle chamber was in the right side of the house and they went up with winding stairs into the middle chamber and out of the middle into the third
1ki69 so he built the house and finished it and covered the house with beams and boards of cedar
1ki610 and then he built chambers against all the house five cubits high and they rested on the house with timber of cedar
1ki611 and the word of the lord came to solomon saying
1ki612 concerning this house which thou art in building if thou wilt walk in my statutes and execute my judgments and keep all my commandments to walk in them then will i perform my word with thee which i spake unto david thy father
1ki613 and i will dwell among the children of israel and will not forsake my people israel
1ki614 so solomon built the house and finished it
1ki615 and he built the walls of the house within with boards of cedar both the floor of the house and the walls of the ceiling and he covered them on the inside with wood and covered the floor of the house with planks of fir
1ki616 and he built twenty cubits on the sides of the house both the floor and the walls with boards of cedar he even built them for it within even for the oracle even for the most holy place
1ki617 and the house that is the temple before it was forty cubits long
1ki618 and the cedar of the house within was carved with knops and open flowers all was cedar there was no stone seen
1ki619 and the oracle he prepared in the house within to set there the ark of the covenant of the lord
1ki620 and the oracle in the forepart was twenty cubits in length and twenty cubits in breadth and twenty cubits in the height thereof and he overlaid it with pure gold and so covered the altar which was of cedar
1ki621 so solomon overlaid the house within with pure gold and he made a partition by the chains of gold before the oracle and he overlaid it with gold
1ki622 and the whole house he overlaid with gold until he had finished all the house also the whole altar that was by the oracle he overlaid with gold
1ki623 and within the oracle he made two cherubims of olive tree each ten cubits high
1ki624 and five cubits was the one wing of the cherub and five cubits the other wing of the cherub from the uttermost part of the one wing unto the uttermost part of the other were ten cubits
1ki625 and the other cherub was ten cubits both the cherubims were of one measure and one size
1ki626 the height of the one cherub was ten cubits and so was it of the other cherub
1ki627 and he set the cherubims within the inner house and they stretched forth the wings of the cherubims so that the wing of the one touched the one wall and the wing of the other cherub touched the other wall and their wings touched one another in the midst of the house
1ki628 and he overlaid the cherubims with gold
1ki629 and he carved all the walls of the house round about with carved figures of cherubims and palm trees and open flowers within and without
1ki630 and the floor of the house he overlaid with gold within and without
1ki631 and for the entering of the oracle he made doors of olive tree the lintel and side posts were a fifth part of the wall
1ki632 the two doors also were of olive tree and he carved upon them carvings of cherubims and palm trees and open flowers and overlaid them with gold and spread gold upon the cherubims and upon the palm trees
1ki633 so also made he for the door of the temple posts of olive tree a fourth part of the wall
1ki634 and the two doors were of fir tree the two leaves of the one door were folding and the two leaves of the other door were folding
1ki635 and he carved thereon cherubims and palm trees and open flowers and covered them with gold fitted upon the carved work
1ki636 and he built the inner court with three rows of hewed stone and a row of cedar beams
1ki637 in the fourth year was the foundation of the house of the lord laid in the month zif
1ki638 and in the eleventh year in the month bul which is the eighth month was the house finished throughout all the parts thereof and according to all the fashion of it so was he seven years in building it
1ki71 but solomon was building his own house thirteen years and he finished all his house
1ki72 he built also the house of the forest of lebanon the length thereof was an hundred cubits and the breadth thereof fifty cubits and the height thereof thirty cubits upon four rows of cedar pillars with cedar beams upon the pillars
1ki73 and it was covered with cedar above upon the beams that lay on forty five pillars fifteen in a row
1ki74 and there were windows in three rows and light was against light in three ranks
1ki75 and all the doors and posts were square with the windows and light was against light in three ranks
1ki76 and he made a porch of pillars the length thereof was fifty cubits and the breadth thereof thirty cubits and the porch was before them and the other pillars and the thick beam were before them
1ki77 then he made a porch for the throne where he might judge even the porch of judgment and it was covered with cedar from one side of the floor to the other
1ki78 and his house where he dwelt had another court within the porch which was of the like work solomon made also an house for pharaoh's daughter whom he had taken to wife like unto this porch
1ki79 all these were of costly stones according to the measures of hewed stones sawed with saws within and without even from the foundation unto the coping and so on the outside toward the great court
1ki710 and the foundation was of costly stones even great stones stones of ten cubits and stones of eight cubits
1ki711 and above were costly stones after the measures of hewed stones and cedars
1ki712 and the great court round about was with three rows of hewed stones and a row of cedar beams both for the inner court of the house of the lord and for the porch of the house
1ki713 and king solomon sent and fetched hiram out of tyre
1ki714 he was a widow's son of the tribe of naphtali and his father was a man of tyre a worker in brass and he was filled with wisdom and understanding and cunning to work all works in brass and he came to king solomon and wrought all his work
1ki715 for he cast two pillars of brass of eighteen cubits high apiece and a line of twelve cubits did compass either of them about
1ki716 and he made two chapiters of molten brass to set upon the tops of the pillars the height of the one chapiter was five cubits and the height of the other chapiter was five cubits
1ki717 and nets of checker work and wreaths of chain work for the chapiters which were upon the top of the pillars seven for the one chapiter and seven for the other chapiter
1ki718 and he made the pillars and two rows round about upon the one network to cover the chapiters that were upon the top with pomegranates and so did he for the other chapiter
1ki719 and the chapiters that were upon the top of the pillars were of lily work in the porch four cubits
1ki720 and the chapiters upon the two pillars had pomegranates also above over against the belly which was by the network and the pomegranates were two hundred in rows round about upon the other chapiter
1ki721 and he set up the pillars in the porch of the temple and he set up the right pillar and called the name thereof jachin and he set up the left pillar and called the name thereof boaz
1ki722 and upon the top of the pillars was lily work so was the work of the pillars finished
1ki723 and he made a molten sea ten cubits from the one brim to the other it was round all about and his height was five cubits and a line of thirty cubits did compass it round about
1ki724 and under the brim of it round about there were knops compassing it ten in a cubit compassing the sea round about the knops were cast in two rows when it was cast
1ki725 it stood upon twelve oxen three looking toward the north and three looking toward the west and three looking toward the south and three looking toward the east and the sea was set above upon them and all their hinder parts were inward
1ki726 and it was an hand breadth thick and the brim thereof was wrought like the brim of a cup with flowers of lilies it contained two thousand baths
1ki727 and he made ten bases of brass four cubits was the length of one base and four cubits the breadth thereof and three cubits the height of it
1ki728 and the work of the bases was on this manner they had borders and the borders were between the ledges
1ki729 and on the borders that were between the ledges were lions oxen and cherubims and upon the ledges there was a base above and beneath the lions and oxen were certain additions made of thin work
1ki730 and every base had four brasen wheels and plates of brass and the four corners thereof had undersetters under the laver were undersetters molten at the side of every addition
1ki731 and the mouth of it within the chapiter and above was a cubit but the mouth thereof was round after the work of the base a cubit and an half and also upon the mouth of it were gravings with their borders foursquare not round
1ki732 and under the borders were four wheels and the axletrees of the wheels were joined to the base and the height of a wheel was a cubit and half a cubit
1ki733 and the work of the wheels was like the work of a chariot wheel their axletrees and their naves and their felloes and their spokes were all molten
1ki734 and there were four undersetters to the four corners of one base and the undersetters were of the very base itself
1ki735 and in the top of the base was there a round compass of half a cubit high and on the top of the base the ledges thereof and the borders thereof were of the same
1ki736 for on the plates of the ledges thereof and on the borders thereof he graved cherubims lions and palm trees according to the proportion of every one and additions round about
1ki737 after this manner he made the ten bases all of them had one casting one measure and one size
1ki738 then made he ten lavers of brass one laver contained forty baths and every laver was four cubits and upon every one of the ten bases one laver
1ki739 and he put five bases on the right side of the house and five on the left side of the house and he set the sea on the right side of the house eastward over against the south
1ki740 and hiram made the lavers and the shovels and the basons so hiram made an end of doing all the work that he made king solomon for the house of the lord
1ki741 the two pillars and the two bowls of the chapiters that were on the top of the two pillars and the two networks to cover the two bowls of the chapiters which were upon the top of the pillars
1ki742 and four hundred pomegranates for the two networks even two rows of pomegranates for one network to cover the two bowls of the chapiters that were upon the pillars
1ki743 and the ten bases and ten lavers on the bases
1ki744 and one sea and twelve oxen under the sea
1ki745 and the pots and the shovels and the basons and all these vessels which hiram made to king solomon for the house of the lord were of bright brass
1ki746 in the plain of jordan did the king cast them in the clay ground between succoth and zarthan
1ki747 and solomon left all the vessels unweighed because they were exceeding many neither was the weight of the brass found out
1ki748 and solomon made all the vessels that pertained unto the house of the lord the altar of gold and the table of gold whereupon the shewbread was
1ki749 and the candlesticks of pure gold five on the right side and five on the left before the oracle with the flowers and the lamps and the tongs of gold
1ki750 and the bowls and the snuffers and the basons and the spoons and the censers of pure gold and the hinges of gold both for the doors of the inner house the most holy place and for the doors of the house to wit of the temple
1ki751 so was ended all the work that king solomon made for the house of the lord and solomon brought in the things which david his father had dedicated even the silver and the gold and the vessels did he put among the treasures of the house of the lord
1ki81 then solomon assembled the elders of israel and all the heads of the tribes the chief of the fathers of the children of israel unto king solomon in jerusalem that they might bring up the ark of the covenant of the lord out of the city of david which is zion
1ki82 and all the men of israel assembled themselves unto king solomon at the feast in the month ethanim which is the seventh month
1ki83 and all the elders of israel came and the priests took up the ark
1ki84 and they brought up the ark of the lord and the tabernacle of the congregation and all the holy vessels that were in the tabernacle even those did the priests and the levites bring up
1ki85 and king solomon and all the congregation of israel that were assembled unto him were with him before the ark sacrificing sheep and oxen that could not be told nor numbered for multitude
1ki86 and the priests brought in the ark of the covenant of the lord unto his place into the oracle of the house to the most holy place even under the wings of the cherubims
1ki87 for the cherubims spread forth their two wings over the place of the ark and the cherubims covered the ark and the staves thereof above
1ki88 and they drew out the staves that the ends of the staves were seen out in the holy place before the oracle and they were not seen without and there they are unto this day
1ki89 there was nothing in the ark save the two tables of stone which moses put there at horeb when the lord made a covenant with the children of israel when they came out of the land of egypt
1ki810 and it came to pass when the priests were come out of the holy place that the cloud filled the house of the lord
1ki811 so that the priests could not stand to minister because of the cloud for the glory of the lord had filled the house of the lord
1ki812 then spake solomon the lord said that he would dwell in the thick darkness
