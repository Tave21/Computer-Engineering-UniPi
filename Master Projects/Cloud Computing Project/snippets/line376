 bertram gives a ring
 by my old beard
 and every hair that's on't helen that's dead
 was a sweet creature such a ring as this
 the last that e'er i took her at court
 i saw upon her finger
bertram hers it was not
king now pray you let me see it for mine eye
 while i was speaking oft was fasten'd to't
 this ring was mine and when i gave it helen
 i bade her if her fortunes ever stood
 necessitied to help that by this token
 i would relieve her had you that craft to reave
 her
 of what should stead her most
bertram my gracious sovereign
 howe'er it pleases you to take it so
 the ring was never hers
countess son on my life
 i have seen her wear it and she reckon'd it
 at her life's rate
lafeu i am sure i saw her wear it
bertram you are deceived my lord she never saw it
 in florence was it from a casement thrown me
 wrapp'd in a paper which contain'd the name
 of her that threw it noble she was and thought
 i stood engaged but when i had subscribed
 to mine own fortune and inform'd her fully
 i could not answer in that course of honour
 as she had made the overture she ceased
 in heavy satisfaction and would never
 receive the ring again
king plutus himself
 that knows the tinct and multiplying medicine
 hath not in nature's mystery more science
 than i have in this ring twas mine twas helen's
 whoever gave it you then if you know
 that you are well acquainted with yourself
 confess twas hers and by what rough enforcement
 you got it from her she call'd the saints to surety
 that she would never put it from her finger
 unless she gave it to yourself in bed
 where you have never come or sent it us
 upon her great disaster
bertram she never saw it
king thou speak'st it falsely as i love mine honour
 and makest conjectural fears to come into me
 which i would fain shut out if it should prove
 that thou art so inhuman'twill not prove so
 and yet i know not thou didst hate her deadly
 and she is dead which nothing but to close
 her eyes myself could win me to believe
 more than to see this ring take him away
 guards seize bertram
 my forepast proofs howe'er the matter fall
 shall tax my fears of little vanity
 having vainly fear'd too little away with him
 we'll sift this matter further
bertram if you shall prove
 this ring was ever hers you shall as easy
 prove that i husbanded her bed in florence
 where yet she never was
 exit guarded
king i am wrapp'd in dismal thinkings
 enter a gentleman
gentleman gracious sovereign
 whether i have been to blame or no i know not
 here's a petition from a florentine
 who hath for four or five removes come short
 to tender it herself i undertook it
 vanquish'd thereto by the fair grace and speech
 of the poor suppliant who by this i know
 is here attending her business looks in her
 with an importing visage and she told me
 in a sweet verbal brief it did concern
 your highness with herself
king reads upon his many protestations to marry me
 when his wife was dead i blush to say it he won
 me now is the count rousillon a widower his vows
 are forfeited to me and my honour's paid to him he
 stole from florence taking no leave and i follow
 him to his country for justice grant it me o
 king in you it best lies otherwise a seducer
 flourishes and a poor maid is undone
 diana capilet
lafeu i will buy me a soninlaw in a fair and toll for
 this i'll none of him
king the heavens have thought well on thee lafeu
 to bring forth this discovery seek these suitors
 go speedily and bring again the count
 i am afeard the life of helen lady
 was foully snatch'd
countess now justice on the doers
 reenter bertram guarded
king i wonder sir sith wives are monsters to you
 and that you fly them as you swear them lordship
 yet you desire to marry
 enter widow and diana
 what woman's that
diana i am my lord a wretched florentine
 derived from the ancient capilet
 my suit as i do understand you know
 and therefore know how far i may be pitied
widow i am her mother sir whose age and honour
 both suffer under this complaint we bring
 and both shall cease without your remedy
king come hither count do you know these women
bertram my lord i neither can nor will deny
 but that i know them do they charge me further
diana why do you look so strange upon your wife
bertram she's none of mine my lord
diana if you shall marry
 you give away this hand and that is mine
 you give away heaven's vows and those are mine
 you give away myself which is known mine
 for i by vow am so embodied yours
 that she which marries you must marry me
 either both or none
lafeu your reputation comes too short for my daughter you
 are no husband for her
bertram my lord this is a fond and desperate creature
 whom sometime i have laugh'd with let your highness
 lay a more noble thought upon mine honour
 than for to think that i would sink it here
king sir for my thoughts you have them ill to friend
 till your deeds gain them fairer prove your honour
 than in my thought it lies
diana good my lord
 ask him upon his oath if he does think
 he had not my virginity
king what say'st thou to her
bertram she's impudent my lord
 and was a common gamester to the camp
diana he does me wrong my lord if i were so
 he might have bought me at a common price
 do not believe him o behold this ring
 whose high respect and rich validity
 did lack a parallel yet for all that
 he gave it to a commoner o the camp
 if i be one
countess he blushes and tis it
 of six preceding ancestors that gem
 conferr'd by testament to the sequent issue
 hath it been owed and worn this is his wife
 that ring's a thousand proofs
king methought you said
 you saw one here in court could witness it
diana i did my lord but loath am to produce
 so bad an instrument his name's parolles
lafeu i saw the man today if man he be
king find him and bring him hither
 exit an attendant
bertram what of him
 he's quoted for a most perfidious slave
 with all the spots o the world tax'd and debosh'd
 whose nature sickens but to speak a truth
 am i or that or this for what he'll utter
 that will speak any thing
king she hath that ring of yours
bertram i think she has certain it is i liked her
 and boarded her i the wanton way of youth
 she knew her distance and did angle for me
 madding my eagerness with her restraint
 as all impediments in fancy's course
 are motives of more fancy and in fine
 her infinite cunning with her modern grace
 subdued me to her rate she got the ring
 and i had that which any inferior might
 at marketprice have bought
diana i must be patient
 you that have turn'd off a first so noble wife
 may justly diet me i pray you yet
 since you lack virtue i will lose a husband
 send for your ring i will return it home
 and give me mine again
bertram i have it not
king what ring was yours i pray you
diana sir much like
 the same upon your finger
king know you this ring this ring was his of late
diana and this was it i gave him being abed
king the story then goes false you threw it him
 out of a casement
diana i have spoke the truth
 enter parolles
bertram my lord i do confess the ring was hers
king you boggle shrewdly every feather stars you
 is this the man you speak of
diana ay my lord
king tell me sirrah but tell me true i charge you
 not fearing the displeasure of your master
 which on your just proceeding i'll keep off
 by him and by this woman here what know you
parolles so please your majesty my master hath been an
 honourable gentleman tricks he hath had in him
 which gentlemen have
king come come to the purpose did he love this woman
parolles faith sir he did love her but how
king how i pray you
parolles he did love her sir as a gentleman loves a woman
