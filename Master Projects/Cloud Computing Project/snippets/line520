 of a beloved daughter and a wife
lysimachus may we not see him
helicanus you may
 but bootless is your sight he will not speak to any
lysimachus yet let me obtain my wish
helicanus behold him
 pericles discovered
 this was a goodly person
 till the disaster that one mortal night
 drove him to this
lysimachus sir king all hail the gods preserve you
 hail royal sir
helicanus it is in vain he will not speak to you
first lord sir
 we have a maid in mytilene i durst wager
 would win some words of him
lysimachus tis well bethought
 she questionless with her sweet harmony
 and other chosen attractions would allure
 and make a battery through his deafen'd parts
 which now are midway stopp'd
 she is all happy as the fairest of all
 and with her fellow maids is now upon
 the leafy shelter that abuts against
 the island's side
 whispers a lord who goes off in the barge of
 lysimachus
helicanus sure all's effectless yet nothing we'll omit
 that bears recovery's name but since your kindness
 we have stretch'd thus far let us beseech you
 that for our gold we may provision have
 wherein we are not destitute for want
 but weary for the staleness
lysimachus o sir a courtesy
 which if we should deny the most just gods
 for every graff would send a caterpillar
 and so afflict our province yet once more
 let me entreat to know at large the cause
 of your king's sorrow
helicanus sit sir i will recount it to you
 but see i am prevented
 reenter from the barge lord with marina and a
 young lady
lysimachus o here is
 the lady that i sent for welcome fair one
 is't not a goodly presence
helicanus she's a gallant lady
lysimachus she's such a one that were i well assured
 came of a gentle kind and noble stock
 i'ld wish no better choice and think me rarely wed
 fair one all goodness that consists in bounty
 expect even here where is a kingly patient
 if that thy prosperous and artificial feat
 can draw him but to answer thee in aught
 thy sacred physic shall receive such pay
 as thy desires can wish
marina sir i will use
 my utmost skill in his recovery provided
 that none but i and my companion maid
 be suffer'd to come near him
lysimachus come let us leave her
 and the gods make her prosperous
 marina sings
lysimachus mark'd he your music
marina no nor look'd on us
lysimachus see she will speak to him
marina hail sir my lord lend ear
pericles hum ha
marina i am a maid
 my lord that ne'er before invited eyes
 but have been gazed on like a comet she speaks
 my lord that may be hath endured a grief
 might equal yours if both were justly weigh'd
 though wayward fortune did malign my state
 my derivation was from ancestors
 who stood equivalent with mighty kings
 but time hath rooted out my parentage
 and to the world and awkward casualties
 bound me in servitude
 aside
 i will desist
 but there is something glows upon my cheek
 and whispers in mine ear go not till he speak'
pericles my fortunesparentagegood parentage
 to equal minewas it not thus what say you
marina i said my lord if you did know my parentage
 you would not do me violence
pericles i do think so pray you turn your eyes upon me
 you are like something thatwhat countrywoman
 here of these shores
marina no nor of any shores
 yet i was mortally brought forth and am
 no other than i appear
pericles i am great with woe and shall deliver weeping
 my dearest wife was like this maid and such a one
 my daughter might have been my queen's square brows
 her stature to an inch as wandlike straight
 as silvervoiced her eyes as jewellike
 and cased as richly in pace another juno
 who starves the ears she feeds and makes them hungry
 the more she gives them speech where do you live
marina where i am but a stranger from the deck
 you may discern the place
pericles where were you bred
 and how achieved you these endowments which
 you make more rich to owe
marina if i should tell my history it would seem
 like lies disdain'd in the reporting
pericles prithee speak
 falseness cannot come from thee for thou look'st
 modest as justice and thou seem'st a palace
 for the crown'd truth to dwell in i will
 believe thee
 and make my senses credit thy relation
 to points that seem impossible for thou look'st
 like one i loved indeed what were thy friends
 didst thou not say when i did push thee back
 which was when i perceived theethat thou camest
 from good descending
marina so indeed i did
pericles report thy parentage i think thou said'st
 thou hadst been toss'd from wrong to injury
 and that thou thought'st thy griefs might equal mine
 if both were open'd
marina some such thing
 i said and said no more but what my thoughts
 did warrant me was likely
pericles tell thy story
 if thine consider'd prove the thousandth part
 of my endurance thou art a man and i
 have suffer'd like a girl yet thou dost look
 like patience gazing on kings graves and smiling
 extremity out of act what were thy friends
 how lost thou them thy name my most kind virgin
 recount i do beseech thee come sit by me
marina my name is marina
pericles o i am mock'd
 and thou by some incensed god sent hither
 to make the world to laugh at me
marina patience good sir
 or here i'll cease
pericles nay i'll be patient
 thou little know'st how thou dost startle me
 to call thyself marina
marina the name
 was given me by one that had some power
 my father and a king
pericles how a king's daughter
 and call'd marina
marina you said you would believe me
 but not to be a troubler of your peace
 i will end here
pericles but are you flesh and blood
 have you a working pulse and are no fairy
 motion well speak on where were you born
 and wherefore call'd marina
marina call'd marina
 for i was born at sea
pericles at sea what mother
marina my mother was the daughter of a king
 who died the minute i was born
 as my good nurse lychorida hath oft
 deliver'd weeping
pericles o stop there a little
 aside
 this is the rarest dream that e'er dull sleep
 did mock sad fools withal this cannot be
 my daughter's buried well where were you bred
 i'll hear you more to the bottom of your story
 and never interrupt you
marina you scorn believe me twere best i did give o'er
pericles i will believe you by the syllable
 of what you shall deliver yet give me leave
 how came you in these parts where were you bred
marina the king my father did in tarsus leave me
 till cruel cleon with his wicked wife
 did seek to murder me and having woo'd
 a villain to attempt it who having drawn to do't
 a crew of pirates came and rescued me
 brought me to mytilene but good sir
 whither will you have me why do you weep
 it may be
 you think me an impostor no good faith
 i am the daughter to king pericles
 if good king pericles be
pericles ho helicanus
helicanus calls my lord
pericles thou art a grave and noble counsellor
 most wise in general tell me if thou canst
 what this maid is or what is like to be
 that thus hath made me weep
helicanus i know not but
 here is the regent sir of mytilene
 speaks nobly of her
lysimachus she would never tell
 her parentage being demanded that
 she would sit still and weep
pericles o helicanus strike me honour'd sir
 give me a gash put me to present pain
 lest this great sea of joys rushing upon me
