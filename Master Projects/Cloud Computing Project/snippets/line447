 imagine me too unhurtful an opposite but indeed i
 can do you little harm you'll forswear this again
lucio i'll be hanged first thou art deceived in me
 friar but no more of this canst thou tell if
 claudio die tomorrow or no
duke vincentio why should he die sir
lucio why for filling a bottle with a tundish i would
 the duke we talk of were returned again the
 ungenitured agent will unpeople the province with
 continency sparrows must not build in his
 houseeaves because they are lecherous the duke
 yet would have dark deeds darkly answered he would
 never bring them to light would he were returned
 marry this claudio is condemned for untrussing
 farewell good friar i prithee pray for me the
 duke i say to thee again would eat mutton on
 fridays he's not past it yet and i say to thee
 he would mouth with a beggar though she smelt brown
 bread and garlic say that i said so farewell
 exit
duke vincentio no might nor greatness in mortality
 can censure scape backwounding calumny
 the whitest virtue strikes what king so strong
 can tie the gall up in the slanderous tongue
 but who comes here
 enter escalus provost and officers with mistress overdone
escalus go away with her to prison
mistress overdone good my lord be good to me your honour is accounted
 a merciful man good my lord
escalus double and treble admonition and still forfeit in
 the same kind this would make mercy swear and play
 the tyrant
provost a bawd of eleven years continuance may it please
 your honour
mistress overdone my lord this is one lucio's information against me
 mistress kate keepdown was with child by him in the
 duke's time he promised her marriage his child
 is a year and a quarter old come philip and jacob
 i have kept it myself and see how he goes about to abuse me
escalus that fellow is a fellow of much licence let him be
 called before us away with her to prison go to
 no more words
 exeunt officers with mistress overdone
 provost my brother angelo will not be altered
 claudio must die tomorrow let him be furnished
 with divines and have all charitable preparation
 if my brother wrought by my pity it should not be
 so with him
provost so please you this friar hath been with him and
 advised him for the entertainment of death
escalus good even good father
duke vincentio bliss and goodness on you
escalus of whence are you
duke vincentio not of this country though my chance is now
 to use it for my time i am a brother
 of gracious order late come from the see
 in special business from his holiness
escalus what news abroad i the world
duke vincentio none but that there is so great a fever on
 goodness that the dissolution of it must cure it
 novelty is only in request and it is as dangerous
 to be aged in any kind of course as it is virtuous
 to be constant in any undertaking there is scarce
 truth enough alive to make societies secure but
 security enough to make fellowships accurst much
 upon this riddle runs the wisdom of the world this
 news is old enough yet it is every day's news i
 pray you sir of what disposition was the duke
escalus one that above all other strifes contended
 especially to know himself
duke vincentio what pleasure was he given to
escalus rather rejoicing to see another merry than merry at
 any thing which professed to make him rejoice a
 gentleman of all temperance but leave we him to
 his events with a prayer they may prove prosperous
 and let me desire to know how you find claudio
 prepared i am made to understand that you have
 lent him visitation
duke vincentio he professes to have received no sinister measure
 from his judge but most willingly humbles himself
 to the determination of justice yet had he framed
 to himself by the instruction of his frailty many
 deceiving promises of life which i by my good
 leisure have discredited to him and now is he
 resolved to die
escalus you have paid the heavens your function and the
 prisoner the very debt of your calling i have
 laboured for the poor gentleman to the extremest
 shore of my modesty but my brother justice have i
 found so severe that he hath forced me to tell him
 he is indeed justice
duke vincentio if his own life answer the straitness of his
 proceeding it shall become him well wherein if he
 chance to fail he hath sentenced himself
escalus i am going to visit the prisoner fare you well
duke vincentio peace be with you
 exeunt escalus and provost
 he who the sword of heaven will bear
 should be as holy as severe
 pattern in himself to know
 grace to stand and virtue go
 more nor less to others paying
 than by selfoffences weighing
 shame to him whose cruel striking
 kills for faults of his own liking
 twice treble shame on angelo
 to weed my vice and let his grow
 o what may man within him hide
 though angel on the outward side
 how may likeness made in crimes
 making practise on the times
 to draw with idle spiders strings
 most ponderous and substantial things
 craft against vice i must apply
 with angelo tonight shall lie
 his old betrothed but despised
 so disguise shall by the disguised
 pay with falsehood false exacting
 and perform an old contracting
 exit
 measure for measure
act iv
scene i the moated grange at st luke's
 enter mariana and a boy
 boy sings
 take o take those lips away
 that so sweetly were forsworn
 and those eyes the break of day
 lights that do mislead the morn
 but my kisses bring again bring again
 seals of love but sealed in vain sealed in vain
mariana break off thy song and haste thee quick away
 here comes a man of comfort whose advice
 hath often still'd my brawling discontent
 exit boy
 enter duke vincentio disguised as before
 i cry you mercy sir and well could wish
 you had not found me here so musical
 let me excuse me and believe me so
 my mirth it much displeased but pleased my woe
duke vincentio tis good though music oft hath such a charm
 to make bad good and good provoke to harm
 i pray you tell me hath any body inquired
 for me here today much upon this time have
 i promised here to meet
mariana you have not been inquired after
 i have sat here all day
 enter isabella
duke vincentio i do constantly believe you the time is come even
 now i shall crave your forbearance a little may
 be i will call upon you anon for some advantage to yourself
mariana i am always bound to you
 exit
duke vincentio very well met and well come
 what is the news from this good deputy
isabella he hath a garden circummured with brick
 whose western side is with a vineyard back'd
 and to that vineyard is a planched gate
 that makes his opening with this bigger key
 this other doth command a little door
 which from the vineyard to the garden leads
 there have i made my promise
 upon the heavy middle of the night
 to call upon him
duke vincentio but shall you on your knowledge find this way
isabella i have ta'en a due and wary note upon't
 with whispering and most guilty diligence
 in action all of precept he did show me
 the way twice o'er
duke vincentio are there no other tokens
 between you greed concerning her observance
isabella no none but only a repair i the dark
 and that i have possess'd him my most stay
 can be but brief for i have made him know
 i have a servant comes with me along
 that stays upon me whose persuasion is
 i come about my brother
duke vincentio tis well borne up
 i have not yet made known to mariana
 a word of this what ho within come forth
 reenter mariana
 i pray you be acquainted with this maid
 she comes to do you good
isabella i do desire the like
duke vincentio do you persuade yourself that i respect you
mariana good friar i know you do and have found it
duke vincentio take then this your companion by the hand
 who hath a story ready for your ear
 i shall attend your leisure but make haste
 the vaporous night approaches
mariana will't please you walk aside
 exeunt mariana and isabella
duke vincentio o place and greatness millions of false eyes
 are stuck upon thee volumes of report
 run with these false and most contrarious quests
 upon thy doings thousand escapes of wit
 make thee the father of their idle dreams
 and rack thee in their fancies
 reenter mariana and isabella
 welcome how agreed
