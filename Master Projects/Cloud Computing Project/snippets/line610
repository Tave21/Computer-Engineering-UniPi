 shepherd which stands by like a weatherbitten
 conduit of many kings reigns i never heard of such
 another encounter which lames report to follow it
 and undoes description to do it
second gentleman what pray you became of antigonus that carried
 hence the child
third gentleman like an old tale still which will have matter to
 rehearse though credit be asleep and not an ear
 open he was torn to pieces with a bear this
 avouches the shepherd's son who has not only his
 innocence which seems much to justify him but a
 handkerchief and rings of his that paulina knows
first gentleman what became of his bark and his followers
third gentleman wrecked the same instant of their master's death and
 in the view of the shepherd so that all the
 instruments which aided to expose the child were
 even then lost when it was found but o the noble
 combat that twixt joy and sorrow was fought in
 paulina she had one eye declined for the loss of
 her husband another elevated that the oracle was
 fulfilled she lifted the princess from the earth
 and so locks her in embracing as if she would pin
 her to her heart that she might no more be in danger
 of losing
first gentleman the dignity of this act was worth the audience of
 kings and princes for by such was it acted
third gentleman one of the prettiest touches of all and that which
 angled for mine eyes caught the water though not
 the fish was when at the relation of the queen's
 death with the manner how she came to't bravely
 confessed and lamented by the king how
 attentiveness wounded his daughter till from one
 sign of dolour to another she did with an alas'
 i would fain say bleed tears for i am sure my
 heart wept blood who was most marble there changed
 colour some swooned all sorrowed if all the world
 could have seen t the woe had been universal
first gentleman are they returned to the court
third gentleman no the princess hearing of her mother's statue
 which is in the keeping of paulinaa piece many
 years in doing and now newly performed by that rare
 italian master julio romano who had he himself
 eternity and could put breath into his work would
 beguile nature of her custom so perfectly he is her
 ape he so near to hermione hath done hermione that
 they say one would speak to her and stand in hope of
 answer thither with all greediness of affection
 are they gone and there they intend to sup
second gentleman i thought she had some great matter there in hand
 for she hath privately twice or thrice a day ever
 since the death of hermione visited that removed
 house shall we thither and with our company piece
 the rejoicing
first gentleman who would be thence that has the benefit of access
 every wink of an eye some new grace will be born
 our absence makes us unthrifty to our knowledge
 let's along
 exeunt gentlemen
autolycus now had i not the dash of my former life in me
 would preferment drop on my head i brought the old
 man and his son aboard the prince told him i heard

 the winter's tale
act v
scene iii a chapel in paulina's house
 enter leontes polixenes florizel perdita
 camillo paulina lords and attendants
leontes o grave and good paulina the great comfort
 that i have had of thee
paulina what sovereign sir
 i did not well i meant well all my services
 you have paid home but that you have vouchsafed
 with your crown'd brother and these your contracted
 heirs of your kingdoms my poor house to visit
 it is a surplus of your grace which never
 my life may last to answer
leontes o paulina
 we honour you with trouble but we came
 to see the statue of our queen your gallery
 have we pass'd through not without much content
 in many singularities but we saw not
 that which my daughter came to look upon
 the statue of her mother
paulina as she lived peerless
 so her dead likeness i do well believe
 excels whatever yet you look'd upon
 or hand of man hath done therefore i keep it
 lonely apart but here it is prepare
 to see the life as lively mock'd as ever
 still sleep mock'd death behold and say tis well
 paulina draws a curtain and discovers hermione
 standing like a statue
 i like your silence it the more shows off
 your wonder but yet speak first you my liege
 comes it not something near
leontes her natural posture
 chide me dear stone that i may say indeed
 thou art hermione or rather thou art she
 in thy not chiding for she was as tender
 as infancy and grace but yet paulina
 hermione was not so much wrinkled nothing
 so aged as this seems
polixenes o not by much
paulina so much the more our carver's excellence
 which lets go by some sixteen years and makes her
 as she lived now
leontes as now she might have done
 so much to my good comfort as it is
 now piercing to my soul o thus she stood
 even with such life of majesty warm life
 as now it coldly stands when first i woo'd her
 i am ashamed does not the stone rebuke me
 for being more stone than it o royal piece
 there's magic in thy majesty which has
 my evils conjured to remembrance and
 from thy admiring daughter took the spirits
 standing like stone with thee
perdita and give me leave
 and do not say tis superstition that
 i kneel and then implore her blessing lady
 dear queen that ended when i but began
 give me that hand of yours to kiss
paulina o patience
 the statue is but newly fix'd the colour's not dry
camillo my lord your sorrow was too sore laid on
 which sixteen winters cannot blow away
 so many summers dry scarce any joy
 did ever so long live no sorrow
 but kill'd itself much sooner
polixenes dear my brother
 let him that was the cause of this have power
 to take off so much grief from you as he
 will piece up in himself
paulina indeed my lord
 if i had thought the sight of my poor image
 would thus have wrought youfor the stone is mine
 i'ld not have show'd it
leontes do not draw the curtain
paulina no longer shall you gaze on't lest your fancy
 may think anon it moves
leontes let be let be
