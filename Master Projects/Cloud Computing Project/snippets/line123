and in the house his disciples asked him again of the same matter
and he saith unto them whosoever shall put away his wife and marry another committeth adultery against her
and if a woman shall put away her husband and be married to another she committeth adultery
and they brought young children to him that he should touch them and his disciples rebuked those that brought them
but when jesus saw it he was much displeased and said unto them suffer the little children to come unto me and forbid them not for of such is the kingdom of god
verily i say unto you whosoever shall not receive the kingdom of god as a little child he shall not enter therein
and he took them up in his arms put his hands upon them and blessed them
and when he was gone forth into the way there came one running and kneeled to him and asked him good master what shall i do that i may inherit eternal life
and jesus said unto him why callest thou me good there is none good but one that is god
thou knowest the commandments do not commit adultery do not kill do not steal do not bear false witness defraud not honour thy father and mother 
and he answered and said unto him master all these have i observed from my youth
then jesus beholding him loved him and said unto him one thing thou lackest go thy way sell whatsoever thou hast and give to the poor and thou shalt have treasure in heaven and come take up the cross and follow me
and he was sad at that saying and went away grieved for he had great possessions
and jesus looked round about and saith unto his disciples how hardly shall they that have riches enter into the kingdom of god
and the disciples were astonished at his words but jesus answereth again and saith unto them children how hard is it for them that trust in riches to enter into the kingdom of god
it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of god
and they were astonished out of measure saying among themselves who then can be saved
and jesus looking upon them saith with men it is impossible but not with god for with god all things are possible
then peter began to say unto him lo we have left all and have followed thee
and jesus answered and said verily i say unto you there is no man that hath left house or brethren or sisters or father or mother or wife or children or lands for my sake and the gospel's
but he shall receive an hundredfold now in this time houses and brethren and sisters and mothers and children and lands with persecutions and in the world to come eternal life
but many that are first shall be last and the last first
and they were in the way going up to jerusalem and jesus went before them and they were amazed and as they followed they were afraid and he took again the twelve and began to tell them what things should happen unto him
saying behold we go up to jerusalem and the son of man shall be delivered unto the chief priests and unto the scribes and they shall condemn him to death and shall deliver him to the gentiles
and they shall mock him and shall scourge him and shall spit upon him and shall kill him and the third day he shall rise again
and james and john the sons of zebedee come unto him saying master we would that thou shouldest do for us whatsoever we shall desire
and he said unto them what would ye that i should do for you
they said unto him grant unto us that we may sit one on thy right hand and the other on thy left hand in thy glory
but jesus said unto them ye know not what ye ask can ye drink of the cup that i drink of and be baptized with the baptism that i am baptized with
and they said unto him we can and jesus said unto them ye shall indeed drink of the cup that i drink of and with the baptism that i am baptized withal shall ye be baptized
but to sit on my right hand and on my left hand is not mine to give but it shall be given to them for whom it is prepared
and when the ten heard it they began to be much displeased with james and john
but jesus called them to him and saith unto them ye know that they which are accounted to rule over the gentiles exercise lordship over them and their great ones exercise authority upon them
but so shall it not be among you but whosoever will be great among you shall be your minister
and whosoever of you will be the chiefest shall be servant of all
for even the son of man came not to be ministered unto but to minister and to give his life a ransom for many
and they came to jericho and as he went out of jericho with his disciples and a great number of people blind bartimaeus the son of timaeus sat by the highway side begging
and when he heard that it was jesus of nazareth he began to cry out and say jesus thou son of david have mercy on me
and many charged him that he should hold his peace but he cried the more a great deal thou son of david have mercy on me
and jesus stood still and commanded him to be called and they call the blind man saying unto him be of good comfort rise he calleth thee
and he casting away his garment rose and came to jesus
and jesus answered and said unto him what wilt thou that i should do unto thee the blind man said unto him lord that i might receive my sight
and jesus said unto him go thy way thy faith hath made thee whole and immediately he received his sight and followed jesus in the way
and when they came nigh to jerusalem unto bethphage and bethany at the mount of olives he sendeth forth two of his disciples
and saith unto them go your way into the village over against you and as soon as ye be entered into it ye shall find a colt tied whereon never man sat loose him and bring him
and if any man say unto you why do ye this say ye that the lord hath need of him and straightway he will send him hither
and they went their way and found the colt tied by the door without in a place where two ways met and they loose him
and certain of them that stood there said unto them what do ye loosing the colt
and they said unto them even as jesus had commanded and they let them go
and they brought the colt to jesus and cast their garments on him and he sat upon him
and many spread their garments in the way and others cut down branches off the trees and strawed them in the way
and they that went before and they that followed cried saying hosanna blessed is he that cometh in the name of the lord
blessed be the kingdom of our father david that cometh in the name of the lord hosanna in the highest
and jesus entered into jerusalem and into the temple and when he had looked round about upon all things and now the eventide was come he went out unto bethany with the twelve
and on the morrow when they were come from bethany he was hungry
and seeing a fig tree afar off having leaves he came if haply he might find any thing thereon and when he came to it he found nothing but leaves for the time of figs was not yet
and jesus answered and said unto it no man eat fruit of thee hereafter for ever and his disciples heard it
and they come to jerusalem and jesus went into the temple and began to cast out them that sold and bought in the temple and overthrew the tables of the moneychangers and the seats of them that sold doves
and would not suffer that any man should carry any vessel through the temple
and he taught saying unto them is it not written my house shall be called of all nations the house of prayer but ye have made it a den of thieves
and the scribes and chief priests heard it and sought how they might destroy him for they feared him because all the people was astonished at his doctrine
and when even was come he went out of the city
and in the morning as they passed by they saw the fig tree dried up from the roots
and peter calling to remembrance saith unto him master behold the fig tree which thou cursedst is withered away
and jesus answering saith unto them have faith in god
for verily i say unto you that whosoever shall say unto this mountain be thou removed and be thou cast into the sea and shall not doubt in his heart but shall believe that those things which he saith shall come to pass he shall have whatsoever he saith
therefore i say unto you what things soever ye desire when ye pray believe that ye receive them and ye shall have them
and when ye stand praying forgive if ye have ought against any that your father also which is in heaven may forgive you your trespasses
but if ye do not forgive neither will your father which is in heaven forgive your trespasses
and they come again to jerusalem and as he was walking in the temple there come to him the chief priests and the scribes and the elders
and say unto him by what authority doest thou these things and who gave thee this authority to do these things
and jesus answered and said unto them i will also ask of you one question and answer me and i will tell you by what authority i do these things
the baptism of john was it from heaven or of men answer me
and they reasoned with themselves saying if we shall say from heaven he will say why then did ye not believe him
but if we shall say of men they feared the people for all men counted john that he was a prophet indeed
and they answered and said unto jesus we cannot tell and jesus answering saith unto them neither do i tell you by what authority i do these things
and he began to speak unto them by parables a certain man planted a vineyard and set an hedge about it and digged a place for the winefat and built a tower and let it out to husbandmen and went into a far country
and at the season he sent to the husbandmen a servant that he might receive from the husbandmen of the fruit of the vineyard
and they caught him and beat him and sent him away empty
and again he sent unto them another servant and at him they cast stones and wounded him in the head and sent him away shamefully handled
and again he sent another and him they killed and many others beating some and killing some
having yet therefore one son his wellbeloved he sent him also last unto them saying they will reverence my son
but those husbandmen said among themselves this is the heir come let us kill him and the inheritance shall be our's
and they took him and killed him and cast him out of the vineyard
what shall therefore the lord of the vineyard do he will come and destroy the husbandmen and will give the vineyard unto others
and have ye not read this scripture the stone which the builders rejected is become the head of the corner
this was the lord's doing and it is marvellous in our eyes
and they sought to lay hold on him but feared the people for they knew that he had spoken the parable against them and they left him and went their way
and they send unto him certain of the pharisees and of the herodians to catch him in his words
and when they were come they say unto him master we know that thou art true and carest for no man for thou regardest not the person of men but teachest the way of god in truth is it lawful to give tribute to caesar or not
shall we give or shall we not give but he knowing their hypocrisy said unto them why tempt ye me bring me a penny that i may see it
and they brought it and he saith unto them whose is this image and superscription and they said unto him caesar's
and jesus answering said unto them render to caesar the things that are caesar's and to god the things that are god's and they marvelled at him
then come unto him the sadducees which say there is no resurrection and they asked him saying
master moses wrote unto us if a man's brother die and leave his wife behind him and leave no children that his brother should take his wife and raise up seed unto his brother
now there were seven brethren and the first took a wife and dying left no seed
and the second took her and died neither left he any seed and the third likewise
and the seven had her and left no seed last of all the woman died also
in the resurrection therefore when they shall rise whose wife shall she be of them for the seven had her to wife
and jesus answering said unto them do ye not therefore err because ye know not the scriptures neither the power of god
for when they shall rise from the dead they neither marry nor are given in marriage but are as the angels which are in heaven
and as touching the dead that they rise have ye not read in the book of moses how in the bush god spake unto him saying i am the god of abraham and the god of isaac and the god of jacob
he is not the god of the dead but the god of the living ye therefore do greatly err
and one of the scribes came and having heard them reasoning together and perceiving that he had answered them well asked him which is the first commandment of all
and jesus answered him the first of all the commandments is hear o israel the lord our god is one lord
and thou shalt love the lord thy god with all thy heart and with all thy soul and with all thy mind and with all thy strength this is the first commandment
and the second is like namely this thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself there is none other commandment greater than these
and the scribe said unto him well master thou hast said the truth for there is one god and there is none other but he
and to love him with all the heart and with all the understanding and with all the soul and with all the strength and to love his neighbour as himself is more than all whole burnt offerings and sacrifices
and when jesus saw that he answered discreetly he said unto him thou art not far from the kingdom of god and no man after that durst ask him any question
and jesus answered and said while he taught in the temple how say the scribes that christ is the son of david
for david himself said by the holy ghost the lord said to my lord sit thou on my right hand till i make thine enemies thy footstool
david therefore himself calleth him lord and whence is he then his son and the common people heard him gladly
and he said unto them in his doctrine beware of the scribes which love to go in long clothing and love salutations in the marketplaces
and the chief seats in the synagogues and the uppermost rooms at feasts
which devour widows houses and for a pretence make long prayers these shall receive greater damnation
and jesus sat over against the treasury and beheld how the people cast money into the treasury and many that were rich cast in much
and there came a certain poor widow and she threw in two mites which make a farthing
and he called unto him his disciples and saith unto them verily i say unto you that this poor widow hath cast more in than all they which have cast into the treasury
for all they did cast in of their abundance but she of her want did cast in all that she had even all her living
and as he went out of the temple one of his disciples saith unto him master see what manner of stones and what buildings are here
and jesus answering said unto him seest thou these great buildings there shall not be left one stone upon another that shall not be thrown down
and as he sat upon the mount of olives over against the temple peter and james and john and andrew asked him privately
tell us when shall these things be and what shall be the sign when all these things shall be fulfilled
and jesus answering them began to say take heed lest any man deceive you
for many shall come in my name saying i am christ and shall deceive many
and when ye shall hear of wars and rumours of wars be ye not troubled for such things must needs be but the end shall not be yet
for nation shall rise against nation and kingdom against kingdom and there shall be earthquakes in divers places and there shall be famines and troubles these are the beginnings of sorrows
but take heed to yourselves for they shall deliver you up to councils and in the synagogues ye shall be beaten and ye shall be brought before rulers and kings for my sake for a testimony against them
and the gospel must first be published among all nations
but when they shall lead you and deliver you up take no thought beforehand what ye shall speak neither do ye premeditate but whatsoever shall be given you in that hour that speak ye for it is not ye that speak but the holy ghost
now the brother shall betray the brother to death and the father the son and children shall rise up against their parents and shall cause them to be put to death
and ye shall be hated of all men for my name's sake but he that shall endure unto the end the same shall be saved
but when ye shall see the abomination of desolation spoken of by daniel the prophet standing where it ought not let him that readeth understand then let them that be in judaea flee to the mountains
and let him that is on the housetop not go down into the house neither enter therein to take any thing out of his house
and let him that is in the field not turn back again for to take up his garment
but woe to them that are with child and to them that give suck in those days
and pray ye that your flight be not in the winter
for in those days shall be affliction such as was not from the beginning of the creation which god created unto this time neither shall be
and except that the lord had shortened those days no flesh should be saved but for the elect's sake whom he hath chosen he hath shortened the days
and then if any man shall say to you lo here is christ or lo he is there believe him not
for false christs and false prophets shall rise and shall shew signs and wonders to seduce if it were possible even the elect
but take ye heed behold i have foretold you all things
but in those days after that tribulation the sun shall be darkened and the moon shall not give her light
and the stars of heaven shall fall and the powers that are in heaven shall be shaken
and then shall they see the son of man coming in the clouds with great power and glory
and then shall he send his angels and shall gather together his elect from the four winds from the uttermost part of the earth to the uttermost part of heaven
now learn a parable of the fig tree when her branch is yet tender and putteth forth leaves ye know that summer is near
so ye in like manner when ye shall see these things come to pass know that it is nigh even at the doors
verily i say unto you that this generation shall not pass till all these things be done
heaven and earth shall pass away but my words shall not pass away
but of that day and that hour knoweth no man no not the angels which are in heaven neither the son but the father
take ye heed watch and pray for ye know not when the time is
for the son of man is as a man taking a far journey who left his house and gave authority to his servants and to every man his work and commanded the porter to watch
watch ye therefore for ye know not when the master of the house cometh at even or at midnight or at the cockcrowing or in the morning
lest coming suddenly he find you sleeping
and what i say unto you i say unto all watch
after two days was the feast of the passover and of unleavened bread and the chief priests and the scribes sought how they might take him by craft and put him to death
but they said not on the feast day lest there be an uproar of the people
and being in bethany in the house of simon the leper as he sat at meat there came a woman having an alabaster box of ointment of spikenard very precious and she brake the box and poured it on his head
and there were some that had indignation within themselves and said why was this waste of the ointment made
for it might have been sold for more than three hundred pence and have been given to the poor and they murmured against her
and jesus said let her alone why trouble ye her she hath wrought a good work on me
for ye have the poor with you always and whensoever ye will ye may do them good but me ye have not always
she hath done what she could she is come aforehand to anoint my body to the burying
verily i say unto you wheresoever this gospel shall be preached throughout the whole world this also that she hath done shall be spoken of for a memorial of her
and judas iscariot one of the twelve went unto the chief priests to betray him unto them
and when they heard it they were glad and promised to give him money and he sought how he might conveniently betray him
and the first day of unleavened bread when they killed the passover his disciples said unto him where wilt thou that we go and prepare that thou mayest eat the passover
and he sendeth forth two of his disciples and saith unto them go ye into the city and there shall meet you a man bearing a pitcher of water follow him
and wheresoever he shall go in say ye to the goodman of the house the master saith where is the guestchamber where i shall eat the passover with my disciples
and he will shew you a large upper room furnished and prepared there make ready for us
and his disciples went forth and came into the city and found as he had said unto them and they made ready the passover
and in the evening he cometh with the twelve
and as they sat and did eat jesus said verily i say unto you one of you which eateth with me shall betray me
and they began to be sorrowful and to say unto him one by one is it i and another said is it i
and he answered and said unto them it is one of the twelve that dippeth with me in the dish
the son of man indeed goeth as it is written of him but woe to that man by whom the son of man is betrayed good were it for that man if he had never been born
and as they did eat jesus took bread and blessed and brake it and gave to them and said take eat this is my body
and he took the cup and when he had given thanks he gave it to them and they all drank of it
and he said unto them this is my blood of the new testament which is shed for many
verily i say unto you i will drink no more of the fruit of the vine until that day that i drink it new in the kingdom of god
and when they had sung an hymn they went out into the mount of olives
and jesus saith unto them all ye shall be offended because of me this night for it is written i will smite the shepherd and the sheep shall be scattered
but after that i am risen i will go before you into galilee
but peter said unto him although all shall be offended yet will not i
and jesus saith unto him verily i say unto thee that this day even in this night before the cock crow twice thou shalt deny me thrice
but he spake the more vehemently if i should die with thee i will not deny thee in any wise likewise also said they all
and they came to a place which was named gethsemane and he saith to his disciples sit ye here while i shall pray
and he taketh with him peter and james and john and began to be sore amazed and to be very heavy
and saith unto them my soul is exceeding sorrowful unto death tarry ye here and watch
and he went forward a little and fell on the ground and prayed that if it were possible the hour might pass from him
and he said abba father all things are possible unto thee take away this cup from me nevertheless not what i will but what thou wilt
and he cometh and findeth them sleeping and saith unto peter simon sleepest thou couldest not thou watch one hour
watch ye and pray lest ye enter into temptation the spirit truly is ready but the flesh is weak
and again he went away and prayed and spake the same words
and when he returned he found them asleep again for their eyes were heavy neither wist they what to answer him
and he cometh the third time and saith unto them sleep on now and take your rest it is enough the hour is come behold the son of man is betrayed into the hands of sinners
rise up let us go lo he that betrayeth me is at hand
and immediately while he yet spake cometh judas one of the twelve and with him a great multitude with swords and staves from the chief priests and the scribes and the elders
