act ii
scene iii an antechamber of the queen's apartments
 enter anne and an old lady
anne not for that neither here's the pang that pinches
 his highness having lived so long with her and she
 so good a lady that no tongue could ever
 pronounce dishonour of her by my life
 she never knew harmdoing o now after
 so many courses of the sun enthroned
 still growing in a majesty and pomp the which
 to leave a thousandfold more bitter than
 tis sweet at first to acquireafter this process
 to give her the avaunt it is a pity
 would move a monster
old lady hearts of most hard temper
 melt and lament for her
anne o god's will much better
 she ne'er had known pomp though't be temporal
 yet if that quarrel fortune do divorce
 it from the bearer tis a sufferance panging
 as soul and body's severing
old lady alas poor lady
 she's a stranger now again
anne so much the more
 must pity drop upon her verily
 i swear tis better to be lowly born
 and range with humble livers in content
 than to be perk'd up in a glistering grief
 and wear a golden sorrow
old lady our content
 is our best having
anne by my troth and maidenhead
 i would not be a queen
old lady beshrew me i would
 and venture maidenhead for't and so would you
 for all this spice of your hypocrisy
 you that have so fair parts of woman on you
 have too a woman's heart which ever yet
 affected eminence wealth sovereignty
 which to say sooth are blessings and which gifts
 saving your mincing the capacity
 of your soft cheveril conscience would receive
 if you might please to stretch it
anne nay good troth
old lady yes troth and troth you would not be a queen
anne no not for all the riches under heaven
old lady tis strange a threepence bow'd would hire me
 old as i am to queen it but i pray you
 what think you of a duchess have you limbs
 to bear that load of title
anne no in truth
old lady then you are weakly made pluck off a little
 i would not be a young count in your way
 for more than blushing comes to if your back
 cannot vouchsafe this burthen'tis too weak
 ever to get a boy
anne how you do talk
 i swear again i would not be a queen
 for all the world
old lady in faith for little england
 you'ld venture an emballing i myself
 would for carnarvonshire although there long'd
 no more to the crown but that lo who comes here
 enter chamberlain
chamberlain good morrow ladies what were't worth to know
 the secret of your conference
anne my good lord
 not your demand it values not your asking
 our mistress sorrows we were pitying
chamberlain it was a gentle business and becoming
 the action of good women there is hope
 all will be well
anne now i pray god amen
chamberlain you bear a gentle mind and heavenly blessings
 follow such creatures that you may fair lady
 perceive i speak sincerely and high note's
 ta'en of your many virtues the king's majesty
 commends his good opinion of you and
 does purpose honour to you no less flowing
 than marchioness of pembroke to which title
 a thousand pound a year annual support
