orleans foolish curs that run winking into the mouth of a
 russian bear and have their heads crushed like
 rotten apples you may as well say that's a
 valiant flea that dare eat his breakfast on the lip of a lion
constable just just and the men do sympathize with the
 mastiffs in robustious and rough coming on leaving
 their wits with their wives and then give them
 great meals of beef and iron and steel they will
 eat like wolves and fight like devils
orleans ay but these english are shrewdly out of beef
constable then shall we find tomorrow they have only stomachs
 to eat and none to fight now is it time to arm
 come shall we about it
orleans it is now two o'clock but let me see by ten
 we shall have each a hundred englishmen

 king henry v
act iv
 prologue
 enter chorus
chorus now entertain conjecture of a time
 when creeping murmur and the poring dark
 fills the wide vessel of the universe
 from camp to camp through the foul womb of night
 the hum of either army stilly sounds
 that the fixed sentinels almost receive
 the secret whispers of each other's watch
 fire answers fire and through their paly flames
 each battle sees the other's umber'd face
 steed threatens steed in high and boastful neighs
 piercing the night's dull ear and from the tents
 the armourers accomplishing the knights
 with busy hammers closing rivets up
 give dreadful note of preparation
 the country cocks do crow the clocks do toll
 and the third hour of drowsy morning name
 proud of their numbers and secure in soul
 the confident and overlusty french
 do the lowrated english play at dice
 and chide the cripple tardygaited night
 who like a foul and ugly witch doth limp
 so tediously away the poor condemned english
 like sacrifices by their watchful fires
 sit patiently and inly ruminate
 the morning's danger and their gesture sad
 investing lanklean cheeks and warworn coats
 presenteth them unto the gazing moon
 so many horrid ghosts o now who will behold
 the royal captain of this ruin'd band
 walking from watch to watch from tent to tent
 let him cry praise and glory on his head'
 for forth he goes and visits all his host
 bids them good morrow with a modest smile
 and calls them brothers friends and countrymen
 upon his royal face there is no note
 how dread an army hath enrounded him
 nor doth he dedicate one jot of colour
 unto the weary and allwatched night
 but freshly looks and overbears attaint
 with cheerful semblance and sweet majesty
 that every wretch pining and pale before
 beholding him plucks comfort from his looks
 a largess universal like the sun
 his liberal eye doth give to every one
 thawing cold fear that mean and gentle all
 behold as may unworthiness define
 a little touch of harry in the night
 and so our scene must to the battle fly
 whereo for pitywe shall much disgrace
 with four or five most vile and ragged foils
 right illdisposed in brawl ridiculous
 the name of agincourt yet sit and see
 minding true things by what their mockeries be

act iv
scene i the english camp at agincourt
 enter king henry bedford and gloucester
king henry v gloucester tis true that we are in great danger
 the greater therefore should our courage be
 good morrow brother bedford god almighty
 there is some soul of goodness in things evil
 would men observingly distil it out
 for our bad neighbour makes us early stirrers
 which is both healthful and good husbandry
 besides they are our outward consciences
 and preachers to us all admonishing
 that we should dress us fairly for our end
 thus may we gather honey from the weed
 and make a moral of the devil himself
 enter erpingham
 good morrow old sir thomas erpingham

king henry v tis good for men to love their present pains
 upon example so the spirit is eased
 and when the mind is quicken'd out of doubt

gower captain fluellen
fluellen so in the name of jesu christ speak lower it is
 the greatest admiration of the universal world when
 the true and aunchient prerogatifes and laws of the
 wars is not kept if you would take the pains but to
 examine the wars of pompey the great you shall

 nor pibble pabble in pompey's camp i warrant you
 you shall find the ceremonies of the wars and the
 cares of it and the forms of it and the sobriety
 of it and the modesty of it to be otherwise
gower why the enemy is loud you hear him all night

 coxcomb is it meet think you that we should also
 look you be an ass and a fool and a prating
 coxcomb in your own conscience now

 enter three soldiers john bates alexander court
 and michael williams
court brother john bates is not that the morning which
 breaks yonder
bates i think it be but we have no great cause to desire
 the approach of day
williams we see yonder the beginning of the day but i think
 we shall never see the end of it who goes there
king henry v a friend
williams under what captain serve you
king henry v under sir thomas erpingham
williams a good old commander and a most kind gentleman i
 pray you what thinks he of our estate
king henry v even as men wrecked upon a sand that look to be
 washed off the next tide
bates he hath not told his thought to the king
king henry v no nor it is not meet he should for though i
 speak it to you i think the king is but a man as i
 am the violet smells to him as it doth to me the
 element shows to him as it doth to me all his
 senses have but human conditions his ceremonies
 laid by in his nakedness he appears but a man and
 though his affections are higher mounted than ours
 yet when they stoop they stoop with the like
 wing therefore when he sees reason of fears as we
 do his fears out of doubt be of the same relish
 as ours are yet in reason no man should possess
 him with any appearance of fear lest he by showing
 it should dishearten his army
bates he may show what outward courage he will but i
 believe as cold a night as tis he could wish
 himself in thames up to the neck and so i would he
