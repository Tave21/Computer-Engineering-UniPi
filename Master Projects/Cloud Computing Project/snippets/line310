third lord tis so be sure of it
first lord how how
second lord i pray you upon what
timon my worthy friends will you draw near
third lord i'll tell you more anon here's a noble feast toward
second lord this is the old man still
third lord will t hold will t hold
second lord it does but time willand so
third lord i do conceive
timon each man to his stool with that spur as he would to
 the lip of his mistress your diet shall be in all
 places alike make not a city feast of it to let
 the meat cool ere we can agree upon the first place
 sit sit the gods require our thanks
 you great benefactors sprinkle our society with
 thankfulness for your own gifts make yourselves
 praised but reserve still to give lest your
 deities be despised lend to each man enough that
 one need not lend to another for were your
 godheads to borrow of men men would forsake the
 gods make the meat be beloved more than the man
 that gives it let no assembly of twenty be without
 a score of villains if there sit twelve women at
 the table let a dozen of them beas they are the
 rest of your fees o godsthe senators of athens
 together with the common lag of peoplewhat is
 amiss in them you gods make suitable for
 destruction for these my present friends as they
 are to me nothing so in nothing bless them and to
 nothing are they welcome
 uncover dogs and lap
 the dishes are uncovered and seen to be full of
 warm water
some speak what does his lordship mean
some others i know not
timon may you a better feast never behold
 you knot of mouthfriends i smoke and lukewarm water
 is your perfection this is timon's last
 who stuck and spangled with your flatteries
 washes it off and sprinkles in your faces
 your reeking villany
 throwing the water in their faces
 live loathed and long
 most smiling smooth detested parasites
 courteous destroyers affable wolves meek bears
 you fools of fortune trencherfriends time's flies
 cap and knee slaves vapours and minutejacks
 of man and beast the infinite malady
 crust you quite o'er what dost thou go
 soft take thy physic firstthou tooand thou
 stay i will lend thee money borrow none
 throws the dishes at them and drives them out
 what all in motion henceforth be no feast
 whereat a villain's not a welcome guest
 burn house sink athens henceforth hated be
 of timon man and all humanity

 timon of athens
act iv
scene i without the walls of athens
 enter timon
timon let me look back upon thee o thou wall
 that girdlest in those wolves dive in the earth
 and fence not athens matrons turn incontinent
 obedience fail in children slaves and fools
 pluck the grave wrinkled senate from the bench
 and minister in their steads to general filths
 convert o the instant green virginity
 do t in your parents eyes bankrupts hold fast
 rather than render back out with your knives
 and cut your trusters throats bound servants steal
 largehanded robbers your grave masters are
 and pill by law maid to thy master's bed
 thy mistress is o the brothel son of sixteen
 pluck the lined crutch from thy old limping sire
 with it beat out his brains piety and fear
 religion to the gods peace justice truth
 domestic awe nightrest and neighbourhood
 instruction manners mysteries and trades
 degrees observances customs and laws
 decline to your confounding contraries
 and let confusion live plagues incident to men
 your potent and infectious fevers heap
 on athens ripe for stroke thou cold sciatica
 cripple our senators that their limbs may halt
 as lamely as their manners lust and liberty
 creep in the minds and marrows of our youth
 that gainst the stream of virtue they may strive
 and drown themselves in riot itches blains
 sow all the athenian bosoms and their crop
 be general leprosy breath infect breath
 at their society as their friendship may
 merely poison nothing i'll bear from thee
 but nakedness thou detestable town
 take thou that too with multiplying bans
 timon will to the woods where he shall find
 the unkindest beast more kinder than mankind
 the gods confoundhear me you good gods all
 the athenians both within and out that wall
 and grant as timon grows his hate may grow
 to the whole race of mankind high and low amen

 timon of athens
act iv
scene ii athens a room in timon's house
 enter flavius with two or three servants
first servant hear you master steward where's our master
 are we undone cast off nothing remaining
flavius alack my fellows what should i say to you
 let me be recorded by the righteous gods
 i am as poor as you
first servant such a house broke
 so noble a master fall'n all gone and not
 one friend to take his fortune by the arm
 and go along with him
second servant as we do turn our backs
 from our companion thrown into his grave
 so his familiars to his buried fortunes
 slink all away leave their false vows with him
 like empty purses pick'd and his poor self
 a dedicated beggar to the air
 with his disease of allshunn'd poverty
 walks like contempt alone more of our fellows
 enter other servants
flavius all broken implements of a ruin'd house
third servant yet do our hearts wear timon's livery
 that see i by our faces we are fellows still
 serving alike in sorrow leak'd is our bark
 and we poor mates stand on the dying deck
 hearing the surges threat we must all part
 into this sea of air
flavius good fellows all
 the latest of my wealth i'll share amongst you
 wherever we shall meet for timon's sake
 let's yet be fellows let's shake our heads and say
 as twere a knell unto our master's fortunes
 we have seen better days let each take some
 nay put out all your hands not one word more
 thus part we rich in sorrow parting poor
 servants embrace and part several ways
 o the fierce wretchedness that glory brings us
 who would not wish to be from wealth exempt
 since riches point to misery and contempt
 who would be so mock'd with glory or to live
 but in a dream of friendship
 to have his pomp and all what state compounds
 but only painted like his varnish'd friends
 poor honest lord brought low by his own heart
 undone by goodness strange unusual blood
 when man's worst sin is he does too much good
 who then dares to be half so kind again
 for bounty that makes gods does still mar men
 my dearest lord bless'd to be most accursed
 rich only to be wretched thy great fortunes
 are made thy chief afflictions alas kind lord
 he's flung in rage from this ingrateful seat
 of monstrous friends nor has he with him to
 supply his life or that which can command it
 i'll follow and inquire him out
 i'll ever serve his mind with my best will
 whilst i have gold i'll be his steward still

act iv
scene iii woods and cave near the seashore
 enter timon from the cave
 o blessed breeding sun draw from the earth
 rotten humidity below thy sister's orb
 infect the air twinn'd brothers of one womb
 whose procreation residence and birth
 scarce is dividant touch them with several fortunes
 the greater scorns the lesser not nature
 to whom all sores lay siege can bear great fortune
 but by contempt of nature
 raise me this beggar and deny t that lord
 the senator shall bear contempt hereditary
 the beggar native honour
 it is the pasture lards the rother's sides
 the want that makes him lean who dares who dares
 in purity of manhood stand upright
 and say this man's a flatterer if one be
