 which now we hold at much uncertainty

gadshill i pray thee lend me thine
second carrier ay when can'st tell lend me thy lantern quoth

gadshill sirrah carrier what time do you mean to come to london
second carrier time enough to go to bed with a candle i warrant
 thee come neighbour mugs we'll call up the
 gentleman they will along with company for they
 have great charge
 exeunt carriers
gadshill what ho chamberlain
chamberlain within at hand quoth pickpurse
gadshill that's even as fair asat hand quoth the
 chamberlain for thou variest no more from picking
 of purses than giving direction doth from labouring
 thou layest the plot how
 enter chamberlain
chamberlain good morrow master gadshill it holds current that
 i told you yesternight there's a franklin in the
 wild of kent hath brought three hundred marks with
 him in gold i heard him tell it to one of his
 company last night at supper a kind of auditor one
 that hath abundance of charge too god knows what
 they are up already and call for eggs and butter
 they will away presently
gadshill sirrah if they meet not with saint nicholas'
 clerks i'll give thee this neck
chamberlain no i'll none of it i pray thee keep that for the
 hangman for i know thou worshippest st nicholas
 as truly as a man of falsehood may
gadshill what talkest thou to me of the hangman if i hang
 i'll make a fat pair of gallows for if i hang old
 sir john hangs with me and thou knowest he is no
 starveling tut there are other trojans that thou
 dreamest not of the which for sport sake are
 content to do the profession some grace that would
 if matters should be looked into for their own
 credit sake make all whole i am joined with no
 footland rakers no longstaff sixpenny strikers
 none of these mad mustachio purplehued maltworms
 but with nobility and tranquillity burgomasters and
 great oneyers such as can hold in such as will
 strike sooner than speak and speak sooner than
 drink and drink sooner than pray and yet zounds
 i lie for they pray continually to their saint the
 commonwealth or rather not pray to her but prey
 on her for they ride up and down on her and make
 her their boots
chamberlain what the commonwealth their boots will she hold
 out water in foul way
gadshill she will she will justice hath liquored her we
 steal as in a castle cocksure we have the receipt
 of fernseed we walk invisible
chamberlain nay by my faith i think you are more beholding to
 the night than to fernseed for your walking invisible
gadshill give me thy hand thou shalt have a share in our
 purchase as i am a true man
chamberlain nay rather let me have it as you are a false thief
gadshill go to homo is a common name to all men bid the
 ostler bring my gelding out of the stable farewell
 you muddy knave
