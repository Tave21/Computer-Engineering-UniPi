 jewel of children seen this hour he had pair'd
 well with this lord there was not full a month
 between their births
leontes prithee no more cease thou know'st
 he dies to me again when talk'd of sure
 when i shall see this gentleman thy speeches
 will bring me to consider that which may
 unfurnish me of reason they are come
 reenter cleomenes and others with florizel and perdita
 your mother was most true to wedlock prince
 for she did print your royal father off
 conceiving you were i but twentyone
 your father's image is so hit in you
 his very air that i should call you brother
 as i did him and speak of something wildly
 by us perform'd before most dearly welcome
 and your fair princessgoddesso alas
 i lost a couple that twixt heaven and earth
 might thus have stood begetting wonder as
 you gracious couple do and then i lost
 all mine own follythe society
 amity too of your brave father whom
 though bearing misery i desire my life
 once more to look on him
florizel by his command
 have i here touch'd sicilia and from him
 give you all greetings that a king at friend
 can send his brother and but infirmity
 which waits upon worn times hath something seized
 his wish'd ability he had himself
 the lands and waters twixt your throne and his
 measured to look upon you whom he loves
 he bade me say somore than all the sceptres
 and those that bear them living
leontes o my brother
 good gentleman the wrongs i have done thee stir
 afresh within me and these thy offices
 so rarely kind are as interpreters
 of my behindhand slackness welcome hither
 as is the spring to the earth and hath he too
 exposed this paragon to the fearful usage
 at least ungentle of the dreadful neptune
 to greet a man not worth her pains much less
 the adventure of her person
florizel good my lord
 she came from libya
leontes where the warlike smalus
 that noble honour'd lord is fear'd and loved
florizel most royal sir from thence from him whose daughter
 his tears proclaim'd his parting with her thence
 a prosperous southwind friendly we have cross'd
 to execute the charge my father gave me
 for visiting your highness my best train
 i have from your sicilian shores dismiss'd
 who for bohemia bend to signify
 not only my success in libya sir
 but my arrival and my wife's in safety
 here where we are
leontes the blessed gods
 purge all infection from our air whilst you
 do climate here you have a holy father
 a graceful gentleman against whose person
 so sacred as it is i have done sin
 for which the heavens taking angry note
 have left me issueless and your father's blest
 as he from heaven merits it with you
 worthy his goodness what might i have been
 might i a son and daughter now have look'd on
 such goodly things as you
 enter a lord
lord most noble sir
 that which i shall report will bear no credit
 were not the proof so nigh please you great sir
 bohemia greets you from himself by me
 desires you to attach his son who has
 his dignity and duty both cast off
 fled from his father from his hopes and with
 a shepherd's daughter
leontes where's bohemia speak
lord here in your city i now came from him
 i speak amazedly and it becomes
 my marvel and my message to your court
 whiles he was hastening in the chase it seems
 of this fair couple meets he on the way
 the father of this seeming lady and
 her brother having both their country quitted
 with this young prince
florizel camillo has betray'd me
 whose honour and whose honesty till now
 endured all weathers
lord lay't so to his charge
 he's with the king your father
leontes who camillo
lord camillo sir i spake with him who now
 has these poor men in question never saw i
 wretches so quake they kneel they kiss the earth
 forswear themselves as often as they speak
 bohemia stops his ears and threatens them
 with divers deaths in death
perdita o my poor father
 the heaven sets spies upon us will not have
 our contract celebrated
leontes you are married
florizel we are not sir nor are we like to be
 the stars i see will kiss the valleys first
 the odds for high and low's alike
leontes my lord
 is this the daughter of a king
florizel she is
 when once she is my wife
leontes that once i see by your good father's speed
 will come on very slowly i am sorry
 most sorry you have broken from his liking
 where you were tied in duty and as sorry
 your choice is not so rich in worth as beauty
 that you might well enjoy her
florizel dear look up
 though fortune visible an enemy
 should chase us with my father power no jot
 hath she to change our loves beseech you sir
 remember since you owed no more to time
 than i do now with thought of such affections
 step forth mine advocate at your request
 my father will grant precious things as trifles
leontes would he do so i'ld beg your precious mistress
 which he counts but a trifle
paulina sir my liege
 your eye hath too much youth in't not a month
 fore your queen died she was more worth such gazes
 than what you look on now
leontes i thought of her
 even in these looks i made
 to florizel
 but your petition
 is yet unanswer'd i will to your father
 your honour not o'erthrown by your desires
 i am friend to them and you upon which errand
 i now go toward him therefore follow me
 and mark what way i make come good my lord
 exeunt
 the winter's tale
act v
scene ii before leontes palace
 enter autolycus and a gentleman
autolycus beseech you sir were you present at this relation
first gentleman i was by at the opening of the fardel heard the old
 shepherd deliver the manner how he found it
 whereupon after a little amazedness we were all
 commanded out of the chamber only this methought i
 heard the shepherd say he found the child
autolycus i would most gladly know the issue of it
first gentleman i make a broken delivery of the business but the
 changes i perceived in the king and camillo were
 very notes of admiration they seemed almost with
 staring on one another to tear the cases of their
 eyes there was speech in their dumbness language
 in their very gesture they looked as they had heard
 of a world ransomed or one destroyed a notable
 passion of wonder appeared in them but the wisest
 beholder that knew no more but seeing could not
 say if the importance were joy or sorrow but in the
 extremity of the one it must needs be
 enter another gentleman
 here comes a gentleman that haply knows more
 the news rogero
second gentleman nothing but bonfires the oracle is fulfilled the
 king's daughter is found such a deal of wonder is
 broken out within this hour that balladmakers
 cannot be able to express it
 enter a third gentleman
 here comes the lady paulina's steward he can
 deliver you more how goes it now sir this news
 which is called true is so like an old tale that
 the verity of it is in strong suspicion has the king
 found his heir
third gentleman most true if ever truth were pregnant by
 circumstance that which you hear you'll swear you
 see there is such unity in the proofs the mantle
 of queen hermione's her jewel about the neck of it
 the letters of antigonus found with it which they
 know to be his character the majesty of the
 creature in resemblance of the mother the affection
 of nobleness which nature shows above her breeding
 and many other evidences proclaim her with all
 certainty to be the king's daughter did you see
 the meeting of the two kings
second gentleman no
third gentleman then have you lost a sight which was to be seen
 cannot be spoken of there might you have beheld one
 joy crown another so and in such manner that it
 seemed sorrow wept to take leave of them for their
 joy waded in tears there was casting up of eyes
 holding up of hands with countenances of such
 distraction that they were to be known by garment
 not by favour our king being ready to leap out of
 himself for joy of his found daughter as if that
 joy were now become a loss cries o thy mother
 thy mother then asks bohemia forgiveness then
 embraces his soninlaw then again worries he his
 daughter with clipping her now he thanks the old
