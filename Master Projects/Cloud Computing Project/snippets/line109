and the fourth kingdom shall be strong as iron forasmuch as iron breaketh in pieces and subdueth all things and as iron that breaketh all these shall it break in pieces and bruise
and whereas thou sawest the feet and toes part of potters clay and part of iron the kingdom shall be divided but there shall be in it of the strength of the iron forasmuch as thou sawest the iron mixed with miry clay
and as the toes of the feet were part of iron and part of clay so the kingdom shall be partly strong and partly broken
and whereas thou sawest iron mixed with miry clay they shall mingle themselves with the seed of men but they shall not cleave one to another even as iron is not mixed with clay
and in the days of these kings shall the god of heaven set up a kingdom which shall never be destroyed and the kingdom shall not be left to other people but it shall break in pieces and consume all these kingdoms and it shall stand for ever
forasmuch as thou sawest that the stone was cut out of the mountain without hands and that it brake in pieces the iron the brass the clay the silver and the gold the great god hath made known to the king what shall come to pass hereafter and the dream is certain and the interpretation thereof sure
then the king nebuchadnezzar fell upon his face and worshipped daniel and commanded that they should offer an oblation and sweet odours unto him
the king answered unto daniel and said of a truth it is that your god is a god of gods and a lord of kings and a revealer of secrets seeing thou couldest reveal this secret
then the king made daniel a great man and gave him many great gifts and made him ruler over the whole province of babylon and chief of the governors over all the wise men of babylon
then daniel requested of the king and he set shadrach meshach and abednego over the affairs of the province of babylon but daniel sat in the gate of the king
nebuchadnezzar the king made an image of gold whose height was threescore cubits and the breadth thereof six cubits he set it up in the plain of dura in the province of babylon
then nebuchadnezzar the king sent to gather together the princes the governors and the captains the judges the treasurers the counsellors the sheriffs and all the rulers of the provinces to come to the dedication of the image which nebuchadnezzar the king had set up
then the princes the governors and captains the judges the treasurers the counsellors the sheriffs and all the rulers of the provinces were gathered together unto the dedication of the image that nebuchadnezzar the king had set up and they stood before the image that nebuchadnezzar had set up
then an herald cried aloud to you it is commanded o people nations and languages
that at what time ye hear the sound of the cornet flute harp sackbut psaltery dulcimer and all kinds of musick ye fall down and worship the golden image that nebuchadnezzar the king hath set up
and whoso falleth not down and worshippeth shall the same hour be cast into the midst of a burning fiery furnace
therefore at that time when all the people heard the sound of the cornet flute harp sackbut psaltery and all kinds of musick all the people the nations and the languages fell down and worshipped the golden image that nebuchadnezzar the king had set up
wherefore at that time certain chaldeans came near and accused the jews
they spake and said to the king nebuchadnezzar o king live for ever
thou o king hast made a decree that every man that shall hear the sound of the cornet flute harp sackbut psaltery and dulcimer and all kinds of musick shall fall down and worship the golden image
and whoso falleth not down and worshippeth that he should be cast into the midst of a burning fiery furnace
there are certain jews whom thou hast set over the affairs of the province of babylon shadrach meshach and abednego these men o king have not regarded thee they serve not thy gods nor worship the golden image which thou hast set up
then nebuchadnezzar in his rage and fury commanded to bring shadrach meshach and abednego then they brought these men before the king
nebuchadnezzar spake and said unto them is it true o shadrach meshach and abednego do not ye serve my gods nor worship the golden image which i have set up
now if ye be ready that at what time ye hear the sound of the cornet flute harp sackbut psaltery and dulcimer and all kinds of musick ye fall down and worship the image which i have made well but if ye worship not ye shall be cast the same hour into the midst of a burning fiery furnace and who is that god that shall deliver you out of my hands
shadrach meshach and abednego answered and said to the king o nebuchadnezzar we are not careful to answer thee in this matter
if it be so our god whom we serve is able to deliver us from the burning fiery furnace and he will deliver us out of thine hand o king
but if not be it known unto thee o king that we will not serve thy gods nor worship the golden image which thou hast set up
then was nebuchadnezzar full of fury and the form of his visage was changed against shadrach meshach and abednego therefore he spake and commanded that they should heat the furnace one seven times more than it was wont to be heated
and he commanded the most mighty men that were in his army to bind shadrach meshach and abednego and to cast them into the burning fiery furnace
then these men were bound in their coats their hosen and their hats and their other garments and were cast into the midst of the burning fiery furnace
therefore because the king's commandment was urgent and the furnace exceeding hot the flame of the fire slew those men that took up shadrach meshach and abednego
and these three men shadrach meshach and abednego fell down bound into the midst of the burning fiery furnace
then nebuchadnezzar the king was astonied and rose up in haste and spake and said unto his counsellors did not we cast three men bound into the midst of the fire they answered and said unto the king true o king
he answered and said lo i see four men loose walking in the midst of the fire and they have no hurt and the form of the fourth is like the son of god
then nebuchadnezzar came near to the mouth of the burning fiery furnace and spake and said shadrach meshach and abednego ye servants of the most high god come forth and come hither then shadrach meshach and abednego came forth of the midst of the fire
and the princes governors and captains and the king's counsellors being gathered together saw these men upon whose bodies the fire had no power nor was an hair of their head singed neither were their coats changed nor the smell of fire had passed on them
then nebuchadnezzar spake and said blessed be the god of shadrach meshach and abednego who hath sent his angel and delivered his servants that trusted in him and have changed the king's word and yielded their bodies that they might not serve nor worship any god except their own god
therefore i make a decree that every people nation and language which speak any thing amiss against the god of shadrach meshach and abednego shall be cut in pieces and their houses shall be made a dunghill because there is no other god that can deliver after this sort
then the king promoted shadrach meshach and abednego in the province of babylon
nebuchadnezzar the king unto all people nations and languages that dwell in all the earth peace be multiplied unto you
i thought it good to shew the signs and wonders that the high god hath wrought toward me
how great are his signs and how mighty are his wonders his kingdom is an everlasting kingdom and his dominion is from generation to generation
i nebuchadnezzar was at rest in mine house and flourishing in my palace
i saw a dream which made me afraid and the thoughts upon my bed and the visions of my head troubled me
therefore made i a decree to bring in all the wise men of babylon before me that they might make known unto me the interpretation of the dream
then came in the magicians the astrologers the chaldeans and the soothsayers and i told the dream before them but they did not make known unto me the interpretation thereof
but at the last daniel came in before me whose name was belteshazzar according to the name of my god and in whom is the spirit of the holy gods and before him i told the dream saying
o belteshazzar master of the magicians because i know that the spirit of the holy gods is in thee and no secret troubleth thee tell me the visions of my dream that i have seen and the interpretation thereof
thus were the visions of mine head in my bed i saw and behold a tree in the midst of the earth and the height thereof was great
the tree grew and was strong and the height thereof reached unto heaven and the sight thereof to the end of all the earth
the leaves thereof were fair and the fruit thereof much and in it was meat for all the beasts of the field had shadow under it and the fowls of the heaven dwelt in the boughs thereof and all flesh was fed of it
i saw in the visions of my head upon my bed and behold a watcher and an holy one came down from heaven
he cried aloud and said thus hew down the tree and cut off his branches shake off his leaves and scatter his fruit let the beasts get away from under it and the fowls from his branches
nevertheless leave the stump of his roots in the earth even with a band of iron and brass in the tender grass of the field and let it be wet with the dew of heaven and let his portion be with the beasts in the grass of the earth
let his heart be changed from man's and let a beast's heart be given unto him and let seven times pass over him
this matter is by the decree of the watchers and the demand by the word of the holy ones to the intent that the living may know that the most high ruleth in the kingdom of men and giveth it to whomsoever he will and setteth up over it the basest of men
this dream i king nebuchadnezzar have seen now thou o belteshazzar declare the interpretation thereof forasmuch as all the wise men of my kingdom are not able to make known unto me the interpretation but thou art able for the spirit of the holy gods is in thee
then daniel whose name was belteshazzar was astonied for one hour and his thoughts troubled him the king spake and said belteshazzar let not the dream or the interpretation thereof trouble thee belteshazzar answered and said my lord the dream be to them that hate thee and the interpretation thereof to thine enemies
the tree that thou sawest which grew and was strong whose height reached unto the heaven and the sight thereof to all the earth
whose leaves were fair and the fruit thereof much and in it was meat for all under which the beasts of the field dwelt and upon whose branches the fowls of the heaven had their habitation
it is thou o king that art grown and become strong for thy greatness is grown and reacheth unto heaven and thy dominion to the end of the earth
and whereas the king saw a watcher and an holy one coming down from heaven and saying hew the tree down and destroy it yet leave the stump of the roots thereof in the earth even with a band of iron and brass in the tender grass of the field and let it be wet with the dew of heaven and let his portion be with the beasts of the field till seven times pass over him
this is the interpretation o king and this is the decree of the most high which is come upon my lord the king
that they shall drive thee from men and thy dwelling shall be with the beasts of the field and they shall make thee to eat grass as oxen and they shall wet thee with the dew of heaven and seven times shall pass over thee till thou know that the most high ruleth in the kingdom of men and giveth it to whomsoever he will
and whereas they commanded to leave the stump of the tree roots thy kingdom shall be sure unto thee after that thou shalt have known that the heavens do rule
wherefore o king let my counsel be acceptable unto thee and break off thy sins by righteousness and thine iniquities by shewing mercy to the poor if it may be a lengthening of thy tranquillity
all this came upon the king nebuchadnezzar
at the end of twelve months he walked in the palace of the kingdom of babylon
the king spake and said is not this great babylon that i have built for the house of the kingdom by the might of my power and for the honour of my majesty
while the word was in the king's mouth there fell a voice from heaven saying o king nebuchadnezzar to thee it is spoken the kingdom is departed from thee
and they shall drive thee from men and thy dwelling shall be with the beasts of the field they shall make thee to eat grass as oxen and seven times shall pass over thee until thou know that the most high ruleth in the kingdom of men and giveth it to whomsoever he will
the same hour was the thing fulfilled upon nebuchadnezzar and he was driven from men and did eat grass as oxen and his body was wet with the dew of heaven till his hairs were grown like eagles feathers and his nails like birds claws
and at the end of the days i nebuchadnezzar lifted up mine eyes unto heaven and mine understanding returned unto me and i blessed the most high and i praised and honoured him that liveth for ever whose dominion is an everlasting dominion and his kingdom is from generation to generation
and all the inhabitants of the earth are reputed as nothing and he doeth according to his will in the army of heaven and among the inhabitants of the earth and none can stay his hand or say unto him what doest thou
at the same time my reason returned unto me and for the glory of my kingdom mine honour and brightness returned unto me and my counsellors and my lords sought unto me and i was established in my kingdom and excellent majesty was added unto me
now i nebuchadnezzar praise and extol and honour the king of heaven all whose works are truth and his ways judgment and those that walk in pride he is able to abase
belshazzar the king made a great feast to a thousand of his lords and drank wine before the thousand
belshazzar whiles he tasted the wine commanded to bring the golden and silver vessels which his father nebuchadnezzar had taken out of the temple which was in jerusalem that the king and his princes his wives and his concubines might drink therein
then they brought the golden vessels that were taken out of the temple of the house of god which was at jerusalem and the king and his princes his wives and his concubines drank in them
they drank wine and praised the gods of gold and of silver of brass of iron of wood and of stone
in the same hour came forth fingers of a man's hand and wrote over against the candlestick upon the plaister of the wall of the king's palace and the king saw the part of the hand that wrote
then the king's countenance was changed and his thoughts troubled him so that the joints of his loins were loosed and his knees smote one against another
the king cried aloud to bring in the astrologers the chaldeans and the soothsayers and the king spake and said to the wise men of babylon whosoever shall read this writing and shew me the interpretation thereof shall be clothed with scarlet and have a chain of gold about his neck and shall be the third ruler in the kingdom
then came in all the king's wise men but they could not read the writing nor make known to the king the interpretation thereof
then was king belshazzar greatly troubled and his countenance was changed in him and his lords were astonied
now the queen by reason of the words of the king and his lords came into the banquet house and the queen spake and said o king live for ever let not thy thoughts trouble thee nor let thy countenance be changed
there is a man in thy kingdom in whom is the spirit of the holy gods and in the days of thy father light and understanding and wisdom like the wisdom of the gods was found in him whom the king nebuchadnezzar thy father the king i say thy father made master of the magicians astrologers chaldeans and soothsayers
forasmuch as an excellent spirit and knowledge and understanding interpreting of dreams and shewing of hard sentences and dissolving of doubts were found in the same daniel whom the king named belteshazzar now let daniel be called and he will shew the interpretation
then was daniel brought in before the king and the king spake and said unto daniel art thou that daniel which art of the children of the captivity of judah whom the king my father brought out of jewry
i have even heard of thee that the spirit of the gods is in thee and that light and understanding and excellent wisdom is found in thee
and now the wise men the astrologers have been brought in before me that they should read this writing and make known unto me the interpretation thereof but they could not shew the interpretation of the thing
and i have heard of thee that thou canst make interpretations and dissolve doubts now if thou canst read the writing and make known to me the interpretation thereof thou shalt be clothed with scarlet and have a chain of gold about thy neck and shalt be the third ruler in the kingdom
then daniel answered and said before the king let thy gifts be to thyself and give thy rewards to another yet i will read the writing unto the king and make known to him the interpretation
o thou king the most high god gave nebuchadnezzar thy father a kingdom and majesty and glory and honour
and for the majesty that he gave him all people nations and languages trembled and feared before him whom he would he slew and whom he would he kept alive and whom he would he set up and whom he would he put down
but when his heart was lifted up and his mind hardened in pride he was deposed from his kingly throne and they took his glory from him
and he was driven from the sons of men and his heart was made like the beasts and his dwelling was with the wild asses they fed him with grass like oxen and his body was wet with the dew of heaven till he knew that the most high god ruled in the kingdom of men and that he appointeth over it whomsoever he will
and thou his son o belshazzar hast not humbled thine heart though thou knewest all this
but hast lifted up thyself against the lord of heaven and they have brought the vessels of his house before thee and thou and thy lords thy wives and thy concubines have drunk wine in them and thou hast praised the gods of silver and gold of brass iron wood and stone which see not nor hear nor know and the god in whose hand thy breath is and whose are all thy ways hast thou not glorified
then was the part of the hand sent from him and this writing was written
and this is the writing that was written mene mene tekel upharsin
this is the interpretation of the thing mene god hath numbered thy kingdom and finished it
tekel thou art weighed in the balances and art found wanting
peres thy kingdom is divided and given to the medes and persians
then commanded belshazzar and they clothed daniel with scarlet and put a chain of gold about his neck and made a proclamation concerning him that he should be the third ruler in the kingdom
in that night was belshazzar the king of the chaldeans slain
and darius the median took the kingdom being about threescore and two years old
it pleased darius to set over the kingdom an hundred and twenty princes which should be over the whole kingdom
and over these three presidents of whom daniel was first that the princes might give accounts unto them and the king should have no damage
then this daniel was preferred above the presidents and princes because an excellent spirit was in him and the king thought to set him over the whole realm
then the presidents and princes sought to find occasion against daniel concerning the kingdom but they could find none occasion nor fault forasmuch as he was faithful neither was there any error or fault found in him
then said these men we shall not find any occasion against this daniel except we find it against him concerning the law of his god
then these presidents and princes assembled together to the king and said thus unto him king darius live for ever
all the presidents of the kingdom the governors and the princes the counsellors and the captains have consulted together to establish a royal statute and to make a firm decree that whosoever shall ask a petition of any god or man for thirty days save of thee o king he shall be cast into the den of lions
now o king establish the decree and sign the writing that it be not changed according to the law of the medes and persians which altereth not
wherefore king darius signed the writing and the decree
now when daniel knew that the writing was signed he went into his house and his windows being open in his chamber toward jerusalem he kneeled upon his knees three times a day and prayed and gave thanks before his god as he did aforetime
then these men assembled and found daniel praying and making supplication before his god
then they came near and spake before the king concerning the king's decree hast thou not signed a decree that every man that shall ask a petition of any god or man within thirty days save of thee o king shall be cast into the den of lions the king answered and said the thing is true according to the law of the medes and persians which altereth not
then answered they and said before the king that daniel which is of the children of the captivity of judah regardeth not thee o king nor the decree that thou hast signed but maketh his petition three times a day
then the king when he heard these words was sore displeased with himself and set his heart on daniel to deliver him and he laboured till the going down of the sun to deliver him
then these men assembled unto the king and said unto the king know o king that the law of the medes and persians is that no decree nor statute which the king establisheth may be changed
then the king commanded and they brought daniel and cast him into the den of lions now the king spake and said unto daniel thy god whom thou servest continually he will deliver thee
and a stone was brought and laid upon the mouth of the den and the king sealed it with his own signet and with the signet of his lords that the purpose might not be changed concerning daniel
then the king went to his palace and passed the night fasting neither were instruments of musick brought before him and his sleep went from him
then the king arose very early in the morning and went in haste unto the den of lions
and when he came to the den he cried with a lamentable voice unto daniel and the king spake and said to daniel o daniel servant of the living god is thy god whom thou servest continually able to deliver thee from the lions
then said daniel unto the king o king live for ever
my god hath sent his angel and hath shut the lions mouths that they have not hurt me forasmuch as before him innocency was found in me and also before thee o king have i done no hurt
then was the king exceeding glad for him and commanded that they should take daniel up out of the den so daniel was taken up out of the den and no manner of hurt was found upon him because he believed in his god
and the king commanded and they brought those men which had accused daniel and they cast them into the den of lions them their children and their wives and the lions had the mastery of them and brake all their bones in pieces or ever they came at the bottom of the den
then king darius wrote unto all people nations and languages that dwell in all the earth peace be multiplied unto you
i make a decree that in every dominion of my kingdom men tremble and fear before the god of daniel for he is the living god and stedfast for ever and his kingdom that which shall not be destroyed and his dominion shall be even unto the end
he delivereth and rescueth and he worketh signs and wonders in heaven and in earth who hath delivered daniel from the power of the lions
so this daniel prospered in the reign of darius and in the reign of cyrus the persian
in the first year of belshazzar king of babylon daniel had a dream and visions of his head upon his bed then he wrote the dream and told the sum of the matters
daniel spake and said i saw in my vision by night and behold the four winds of the heaven strove upon the great sea
and four great beasts came up from the sea diverse one from another
the first was like a lion and had eagle's wings i beheld till the wings thereof were plucked and it was lifted up from the earth and made stand upon the feet as a man and a man's heart was given to it
and behold another beast a second like to a bear and it raised up itself on one side and it had three ribs in the mouth of it between the teeth of it and they said thus unto it arise devour much flesh
after this i beheld and lo another like a leopard which had upon the back of it four wings of a fowl the beast had also four heads and dominion was given to it
after this i saw in the night visions and behold a fourth beast dreadful and terrible and strong exceedingly and it had great iron teeth it devoured and brake in pieces and stamped the residue with the feet of it and it was diverse from all the beasts that were before it and it had ten horns
i considered the horns and behold there came up among them another little horn before whom there were three of the first horns plucked up by the roots and behold in this horn were eyes like the eyes of man and a mouth speaking great things
i beheld till the thrones were cast down and the ancient of days did sit whose garment was white as snow and the hair of his head like the pure wool his throne was like the fiery flame and his wheels as burning fire
a fiery stream issued and came forth from before him thousand thousands ministered unto him and ten thousand times ten thousand stood before him the judgment was set and the books were opened
i beheld then because of the voice of the great words which the horn spake i beheld even till the beast was slain and his body destroyed and given to the burning flame
as concerning the rest of the beasts they had their dominion taken away yet their lives were prolonged for a season and time
i saw in the night visions and behold one like the son of man came with the clouds of heaven and came to the ancient of days and they brought him near before him
and there was given him dominion and glory and a kingdom that all people nations and languages should serve him his dominion is an everlasting dominion which shall not pass away and his kingdom that which shall not be destroyed
i daniel was grieved in my spirit in the midst of my body and the visions of my head troubled me
i came near unto one of them that stood by and asked him the truth of all this so he told me and made me know the interpretation of the things
these great beasts which are four are four kings which shall arise out of the earth
but the saints of the most high shall take the kingdom and possess the kingdom for ever even for ever and ever
then i would know the truth of the fourth beast which was diverse from all the others exceeding dreadful whose teeth were of iron and his nails of brass which devoured brake in pieces and stamped the residue with his feet
and of the ten horns that were in his head and of the other which came up and before whom three fell even of that horn that had eyes and a mouth that spake very great things whose look was more stout than his fellows
i beheld and the same horn made war with the saints and prevailed against them
until the ancient of days came and judgment was given to the saints of the most high and the time came that the saints possessed the kingdom
thus he said the fourth beast shall be the fourth kingdom upon earth which shall be diverse from all kingdoms and shall devour the whole earth and shall tread it down and break it in pieces
and the ten horns out of this kingdom are ten kings that shall arise and another shall rise after them and he shall be diverse from the first and he shall subdue three kings
and he shall speak great words against the most high and shall wear out the saints of the most high and think to change times and laws and they shall be given into his hand until a time and times and the dividing of time
but the judgment shall sit and they shall take away his dominion to consume and to destroy it unto the end
and the kingdom and dominion and the greatness of the kingdom under the whole heaven shall be given to the people of the saints of the most high whose kingdom is an everlasting kingdom and all dominions shall serve and obey him
hitherto is the end of the matter as for me daniel my cogitations much troubled me and my countenance changed in me but i kept the matter in my heart
in the third year of the reign of king belshazzar a vision appeared unto me even unto me daniel after that which appeared unto me at the first
and i saw in a vision and it came to pass when i saw that i was at shushan in the palace which is in the province of elam and i saw in a vision and i was by the river of ulai
then i lifted up mine eyes and saw and behold there stood before the river a ram which had two horns and the two horns were high but one was higher than the other and the higher came up last
i saw the ram pushing westward and northward and southward so that no beasts might stand before him neither was there any that could deliver out of his hand but he did according to his will and became great
and as i was considering behold an he goat came from the west on the face of the whole earth and touched not the ground and the goat had a notable horn between his eyes
and he came to the ram that had two horns which i had seen standing before the river and ran unto him in the fury of his power
and i saw him come close unto the ram and he was moved with choler against him and smote the ram and brake his two horns and there was no power in the ram to stand before him but he cast him down to the ground and stamped upon him and there was none that could deliver the ram out of his hand
therefore the he goat waxed very great and when he was strong the great horn was broken and for it came up four notable ones toward the four winds of heaven
and out of one of them came forth a little horn which waxed exceeding great toward the south and toward the east and toward the pleasant land
and it waxed great even to the host of heaven and it cast down some of the host and of the stars to the ground and stamped upon them
yea he magnified himself even to the prince of the host and by him the daily sacrifice was taken away and the place of his sanctuary was cast down
and an host was given him against the daily sacrifice by reason of transgression and it cast down the truth to the ground and it practised and prospered
then i heard one saint speaking and another saint said unto that certain saint which spake how long shall be the vision concerning the daily sacrifice and the transgression of desolation to give both the sanctuary and the host to be trodden under foot
and he said unto me unto two thousand and three hundred days then shall the sanctuary be cleansed
and it came to pass when i even i daniel had seen the vision and sought for the meaning then behold there stood before me as the appearance of a man
and i heard a man's voice between the banks of ulai which called and said gabriel make this man to understand the vision
so he came near where i stood and when he came i was afraid and fell upon my face but he said unto me understand o son of man for at the time of the end shall be the vision
now as he was speaking with me i was in a deep sleep on my face toward the ground but he touched me and set me upright
and he said behold i will make thee know what shall be in the last end of the indignation for at the time appointed the end shall be
the ram which thou sawest having two horns are the kings of media and persia
and the rough goat is the king of grecia and the great horn that is between his eyes is the first king
now that being broken whereas four stood up for it four kingdoms shall stand up out of the nation but not in his power
and in the latter time of their kingdom when the transgressors are come to the full a king of fierce countenance and understanding dark sentences shall stand up
and his power shall be mighty but not by his own power and he shall destroy wonderfully and shall prosper and practise and shall destroy the mighty and the holy people
and through his policy also he shall cause craft to prosper in his hand and he shall magnify himself in his heart and by peace shall destroy many he shall also stand up against the prince of princes but he shall be broken without hand
and the vision of the evening and the morning which was told is true wherefore shut thou up the vision for it shall be for many days
and i daniel fainted and was sick certain days afterward i rose up and did the king's business and i was astonished at the vision but none understood it
in the first year of darius the son of ahasuerus of the seed of the medes which was made king over the realm of the chaldeans
in the first year of his reign i daniel understood by books the number of the years whereof the word of the lord came to jeremiah the prophet that he would accomplish seventy years in the desolations of jerusalem
and i set my face unto the lord god to seek by prayer and supplications with fasting and sackcloth and ashes
and i prayed unto the lord my god and made my confession and said o lord the great and dreadful god keeping the covenant and mercy to them that love him and to them that keep his commandments
we have sinned and have committed iniquity and have done wickedly and have rebelled even by departing from thy precepts and from thy judgments
neither have we hearkened unto thy servants the prophets which spake in thy name to our kings our princes and our fathers and to all the people of the land
o lord righteousness belongeth unto thee but unto us confusion of faces as at this day to the men of judah and to the inhabitants of jerusalem and unto all israel that are near and that are far off through all the countries whither thou hast driven them because of their trespass that they have trespassed against thee
o lord to us belongeth confusion of face to our kings to our princes and to our fathers because we have sinned against thee
to the lord our god belong mercies and forgivenesses though we have rebelled against him
