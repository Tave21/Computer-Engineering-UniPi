and i will give it into the hands of the strangers for a prey and to the wicked of the earth for a spoil and they shall pollute it
my face will i turn also from them and they shall pollute my secret place for the robbers shall enter into it and defile it
make a chain for the land is full of bloody crimes and the city is full of violence
wherefore i will bring the worst of the heathen and they shall possess their houses i will also make the pomp of the strong to cease and their holy places shall be defiled
destruction cometh and they shall seek peace and there shall be none
mischief shall come upon mischief and rumour shall be upon rumour then shall they seek a vision of the prophet but the law shall perish from the priest and counsel from the ancients
the king shall mourn and the prince shall be clothed with desolation and the hands of the people of the land shall be troubled i will do unto them after their way and according to their deserts will i judge them and they shall know that i am the lord
and it came to pass in the sixth year in the sixth month in the fifth day of the month as i sat in mine house and the elders of judah sat before me that the hand of the lord god fell there upon me
then i beheld and lo a likeness as the appearance of fire from the appearance of his loins even downward fire and from his loins even upward as the appearance of brightness as the colour of amber
and he put forth the form of an hand and took me by a lock of mine head and the spirit lifted me up between the earth and the heaven and brought me in the visions of god to jerusalem to the door of the inner gate that looketh toward the north where was the seat of the image of jealousy which provoketh to jealousy
and behold the glory of the god of israel was there according to the vision that i saw in the plain
then said he unto me son of man lift up thine eyes now the way toward the north so i lifted up mine eyes the way toward the north and behold northward at the gate of the altar this image of jealousy in the entry
he said furthermore unto me son of man seest thou what they do even the great abominations that the house of israel committeth here that i should go far off from my sanctuary but turn thee yet again and thou shalt see greater abominations
and he brought me to the door of the court and when i looked behold a hole in the wall
then said he unto me son of man dig now in the wall and when i had digged in the wall behold a door
and he said unto me go in and behold the wicked abominations that they do here
so i went in and saw and behold every form of creeping things and abominable beasts and all the idols of the house of israel pourtrayed upon the wall round about
and there stood before them seventy men of the ancients of the house of israel and in the midst of them stood jaazaniah the son of shaphan with every man his censer in his hand and a thick cloud of incense went up
then said he unto me son of man hast thou seen what the ancients of the house of israel do in the dark every man in the chambers of his imagery for they say the lord seeth us not the lord hath forsaken the earth
he said also unto me turn thee yet again and thou shalt see greater abominations that they do
then he brought me to the door of the gate of the lord's house which was toward the north and behold there sat women weeping for tammuz
then said he unto me hast thou seen this o son of man turn thee yet again and thou shalt see greater abominations than these
and he brought me into the inner court of the lord's house and behold at the door of the temple of the lord between the porch and the altar were about five and twenty men with their backs toward the temple of the lord and their faces toward the east and they worshipped the sun toward the east
then he said unto me hast thou seen this o son of man is it a light thing to the house of judah that they commit the abominations which they commit here for they have filled the land with violence and have returned to provoke me to anger and lo they put the branch to their nose
therefore will i also deal in fury mine eye shall not spare neither will i have pity and though they cry in mine ears with a loud voice yet will i not hear them
he cried also in mine ears with a loud voice saying cause them that have charge over the city to draw near even every man with his destroying weapon in his hand
and behold six men came from the way of the higher gate which lieth toward the north and every man a slaughter weapon in his hand and one man among them was clothed with linen with a writer's inkhorn by his side and they went in and stood beside the brasen altar
and the glory of the god of israel was gone up from the cherub whereupon he was to the threshold of the house and he called to the man clothed with linen which had the writer's inkhorn by his side
and the lord said unto him go through the midst of the city through the midst of jerusalem and set a mark upon the foreheads of the men that sigh and that cry for all the abominations that be done in the midst thereof
and to the others he said in mine hearing go ye after him through the city and smite let not your eye spare neither have ye pity
slay utterly old and young both maids and little children and women but come not near any man upon whom is the mark and begin at my sanctuary then they began at the ancient men which were before the house
and he said unto them defile the house and fill the courts with the slain go ye forth and they went forth and slew in the city
and it came to pass while they were slaying them and i was left that i fell upon my face and cried and said ah lord god wilt thou destroy all the residue of israel in thy pouring out of thy fury upon jerusalem
then said he unto me the iniquity of the house of israel and judah is exceeding great and the land is full of blood and the city full of perverseness for they say the lord hath forsaken the earth and the lord seeth not
and as for me also mine eye shall not spare neither will i have pity but i will recompense their way upon their head
and behold the man clothed with linen which had the inkhorn by his side reported the matter saying i have done as thou hast commanded me
then i looked and behold in the firmament that was above the head of the cherubims there appeared over them as it were a sapphire stone as the appearance of the likeness of a throne
and he spake unto the man clothed with linen and said go in between the wheels even under the cherub and fill thine hand with coals of fire from between the cherubims and scatter them over the city and he went in in my sight
now the cherubims stood on the right side of the house when the man went in and the cloud filled the inner court
then the glory of the lord went up from the cherub and stood over the threshold of the house and the house was filled with the cloud and the court was full of the brightness of the lord's glory
and the sound of the cherubims wings was heard even to the outer court as the voice of the almighty god when he speaketh
and it came to pass that when he had commanded the man clothed with linen saying take fire from between the wheels from between the cherubims then he went in and stood beside the wheels
and one cherub stretched forth his hand from between the cherubims unto the fire that was between the cherubims and took thereof and put it into the hands of him that was clothed with linen who took it and went out
and there appeared in the cherubims the form of a man's hand under their wings
and when i looked behold the four wheels by the cherubims one wheel by one cherub and another wheel by another cherub and the appearance of the wheels was as the colour of a beryl stone
and as for their appearances they four had one likeness as if a wheel had been in the midst of a wheel
when they went they went upon their four sides they turned not as they went but to the place whither the head looked they followed it they turned not as they went
and their whole body and their backs and their hands and their wings and the wheels were full of eyes round about even the wheels that they four had
as for the wheels it was cried unto them in my hearing o wheel
and every one had four faces the first face was the face of a cherub and the second face was the face of a man and the third the face of a lion and the fourth the face of an eagle
and the cherubims were lifted up this is the living creature that i saw by the river of chebar
and when the cherubims went the wheels went by them and when the cherubims lifted up their wings to mount up from the earth the same wheels also turned not from beside them
when they stood these stood and when they were lifted up these lifted up themselves also for the spirit of the living creature was in them
then the glory of the lord departed from off the threshold of the house and stood over the cherubims
and the cherubims lifted up their wings and mounted up from the earth in my sight when they went out the wheels also were beside them and every one stood at the door of the east gate of the lord's house and the glory of the god of israel was over them above
this is the living creature that i saw under the god of israel by the river of chebar and i knew that they were the cherubims
every one had four faces apiece and every one four wings and the likeness of the hands of a man was under their wings
and the likeness of their faces was the same faces which i saw by the river of chebar their appearances and themselves they went every one straight forward
moreover the spirit lifted me up and brought me unto the east gate of the lord's house which looketh eastward and behold at the door of the gate five and twenty men among whom i saw jaazaniah the son of azur and pelatiah the son of benaiah princes of the people
then said he unto me son of man these are the men that devise mischief and give wicked counsel in this city
which say it is not near let us build houses this city is the caldron and we be the flesh
therefore prophesy against them prophesy o son of man
and the spirit of the lord fell upon me and said unto me speak thus saith the lord thus have ye said o house of israel for i know the things that come into your mind every one of them
ye have multiplied your slain in this city and ye have filled the streets thereof with the slain
therefore thus saith the lord god your slain whom ye have laid in the midst of it they are the flesh and this city is the caldron but i will bring you forth out of the midst of it
ye have feared the sword and i will bring a sword upon you saith the lord god
and i will bring you out of the midst thereof and deliver you into the hands of strangers and will execute judgments among you
ye shall fall by the sword i will judge you in the border of israel and ye shall know that i am the lord
this city shall not be your caldron neither shall ye be the flesh in the midst thereof but i will judge you in the border of israel
and ye shall know that i am the lord for ye have not walked in my statutes neither executed my judgments but have done after the manners of the heathen that are round about you
and it came to pass when i prophesied that pelatiah the son of benaiah died then fell i down upon my face and cried with a loud voice and said ah lord god wilt thou make a full end of the remnant of israel
again the word of the lord came unto me saying
son of man thy brethren even thy brethren the men of thy kindred and all the house of israel wholly are they unto whom the inhabitants of jerusalem have said get you far from the lord unto us is this land given in possession
therefore say thus saith the lord god although i have cast them far off among the heathen and although i have scattered them among the countries yet will i be to them as a little sanctuary in the countries where they shall come
therefore say thus saith the lord god i will even gather you from the people and assemble you out of the countries where ye have been scattered and i will give you the land of israel
and they shall come thither and they shall take away all the detestable things thereof and all the abominations thereof from thence
and i will give them one heart and i will put a new spirit within you and i will take the stony heart out of their flesh and will give them an heart of flesh
that they may walk in my statutes and keep mine ordinances and do them and they shall be my people and i will be their god
but as for them whose heart walketh after the heart of their detestable things and their abominations i will recompense their way upon their own heads saith the lord god
then did the cherubims lift up their wings and the wheels beside them and the glory of the god of israel was over them above
and the glory of the lord went up from the midst of the city and stood upon the mountain which is on the east side of the city
afterwards the spirit took me up and brought me in a vision by the spirit of god into chaldea to them of the captivity so the vision that i had seen went up from me
then i spake unto them of the captivity all the things that the lord had shewed me
the word of the lord also came unto me saying
son of man thou dwellest in the midst of a rebellious house which have eyes to see and see not they have ears to hear and hear not for they are a rebellious house
therefore thou son of man prepare thee stuff for removing and remove by day in their sight and thou shalt remove from thy place to another place in their sight it may be they will consider though they be a rebellious house
then shalt thou bring forth thy stuff by day in their sight as stuff for removing and thou shalt go forth at even in their sight as they that go forth into captivity
dig thou through the wall in their sight and carry out thereby
in their sight shalt thou bear it upon thy shoulders and carry it forth in the twilight thou shalt cover thy face that thou see not the ground for i have set thee for a sign unto the house of israel
and i did so as i was commanded i brought forth my stuff by day as stuff for captivity and in the even i digged through the wall with mine hand i brought it forth in the twilight and i bare it upon my shoulder in their sight
and in the morning came the word of the lord unto me saying
son of man hath not the house of israel the rebellious house said unto thee what doest thou
say thou unto them thus saith the lord god this burden concerneth the prince in jerusalem and all the house of israel that are among them
say i am your sign like as i have done so shall it be done unto them they shall remove and go into captivity
and the prince that is among them shall bear upon his shoulder in the twilight and shall go forth they shall dig through the wall to carry out thereby he shall cover his face that he see not the ground with his eyes
my net also will i spread upon him and he shall be taken in my snare and i will bring him to babylon to the land of the chaldeans yet shall he not see it though he shall die there
and i will scatter toward every wind all that are about him to help him and all his bands and i will draw out the sword after them
and they shall know that i am the lord when i shall scatter them among the nations and disperse them in the countries
but i will leave a few men of them from the sword from the famine and from the pestilence that they may declare all their abominations among the heathen whither they come and they shall know that i am the lord
moreover the word of the lord came to me saying
son of man eat thy bread with quaking and drink thy water with trembling and with carefulness
and say unto the people of the land thus saith the lord god of the inhabitants of jerusalem and of the land of israel they shall eat their bread with carefulness and drink their water with astonishment that her land may be desolate from all that is therein because of the violence of all them that dwell therein
and the cities that are inhabited shall be laid waste and the land shall be desolate and ye shall know that i am the lord
and the word of the lord came unto me saying
son of man what is that proverb that ye have in the land of israel saying the days are prolonged and every vision faileth
tell them therefore thus saith the lord god i will make this proverb to cease and they shall no more use it as a proverb in israel but say unto them the days are at hand and the effect of every vision
for there shall be no more any vain vision nor flattering divination within the house of israel
for i am the lord i will speak and the word that i shall speak shall come to pass it shall be no more prolonged for in your days o rebellious house will i say the word and will perform it saith the lord god
again the word of the lord came to me saying
son of man behold they of the house of israel say the vision that he seeth is for many days to come and he prophesieth of the times that are far off
therefore say unto them thus saith the lord god there shall none of my words be prolonged any more but the word which i have spoken shall be done saith the lord god
and the word of the lord came unto me saying
son of man prophesy against the prophets of israel that prophesy and say thou unto them that prophesy out of their own hearts hear ye the word of the lord
thus saith the lord god woe unto the foolish prophets that follow their own spirit and have seen nothing
o israel thy prophets are like the foxes in the deserts
ye have not gone up into the gaps neither made up the hedge for the house of israel to stand in the battle in the day of the lord
they have seen vanity and lying divination saying the lord saith and the lord hath not sent them and they have made others to hope that they would confirm the word
have ye not seen a vain vision and have ye not spoken a lying divination whereas ye say the lord saith it albeit i have not spoken
therefore thus saith the lord god because ye have spoken vanity and seen lies therefore behold i am against you saith the lord god
and mine hand shall be upon the prophets that see vanity and that divine lies they shall not be in the assembly of my people neither shall they be written in the writing of the house of israel neither shall they enter into the land of israel and ye shall know that i am the lord god
because even because they have seduced my people saying peace and there was no peace and one built up a wall and lo others daubed it with untempered morter
say unto them which daub it with untempered morter that it shall fall there shall be an overflowing shower and ye o great hailstones shall fall and a stormy wind shall rend it
lo when the wall is fallen shall it not be said unto you where is the daubing wherewith ye have daubed it
therefore thus saith the lord god i will even rend it with a stormy wind in my fury and there shall be an overflowing shower in mine anger and great hailstones in my fury to consume it
so will i break down the wall that ye have daubed with untempered morter and bring it down to the ground so that the foundation thereof shall be discovered and it shall fall and ye shall be consumed in the midst thereof and ye shall know that i am the lord
thus will i accomplish my wrath upon the wall and upon them that have daubed it with untempered morter and will say unto you the wall is no more neither they that daubed it
to wit the prophets of israel which prophesy concerning jerusalem and which see visions of peace for her and there is no peace saith the lord god
likewise thou son of man set thy face against the daughters of thy people which prophesy out of their own heart and prophesy thou against them
and say thus saith the lord god woe to the women that sew pillows to all armholes and make kerchiefs upon the head of every stature to hunt souls will ye hunt the souls of my people and will ye save the souls alive that come unto you
and will ye pollute me among my people for handfuls of barley and for pieces of bread to slay the souls that should not die and to save the souls alive that should not live by your lying to my people that hear your lies
wherefore thus saith the lord god behold i am against your pillows wherewith ye there hunt the souls to make them fly and i will tear them from your arms and will let the souls go even the souls that ye hunt to make them fly
your kerchiefs also will i tear and deliver my people out of your hand and they shall be no more in your hand to be hunted and ye shall know that i am the lord
because with lies ye have made the heart of the righteous sad whom i have not made sad and strengthened the hands of the wicked that he should not return from his wicked way by promising him life
therefore ye shall see no more vanity nor divine divinations for i will deliver my people out of your hand and ye shall know that i am the lord
then came certain of the elders of israel unto me and sat before me
and the word of the lord came unto me saying
son of man these men have set up their idols in their heart and put the stumblingblock of their iniquity before their face should i be enquired of at all by them
therefore speak unto them and say unto them thus saith the lord god every man of the house of israel that setteth up his idols in his heart and putteth the stumblingblock of his iniquity before his face and cometh to the prophet i the lord will answer him that cometh according to the multitude of his idols
that i may take the house of israel in their own heart because they are all estranged from me through their idols
therefore say unto the house of israel thus saith the lord god repent and turn yourselves from your idols and turn away your faces from all your abominations
for every one of the house of israel or of the stranger that sojourneth in israel which separateth himself from me and setteth up his idols in his heart and putteth the stumblingblock of his iniquity before his face and cometh to a prophet to enquire of him concerning me i the lord will answer him by myself
and i will set my face against that man and will make him a sign and a proverb and i will cut him off from the midst of my people and ye shall know that i am the lord
and if the prophet be deceived when he hath spoken a thing i the lord have deceived that prophet and i will stretch out my hand upon him and will destroy him from the midst of my people israel
and they shall bear the punishment of their iniquity the punishment of the prophet shall be even as the punishment of him that seeketh unto him
that the house of israel may go no more astray from me neither be polluted any more with all their transgressions but that they may be my people and i may be their god saith the lord god
the word of the lord came again to me saying
son of man when the land sinneth against me by trespassing grievously then will i stretch out mine hand upon it and will break the staff of the bread thereof and will send famine upon it and will cut off man and beast from it
though these three men noah daniel and job were in it they should deliver but their own souls by their righteousness saith the lord god
if i cause noisome beasts to pass through the land and they spoil it so that it be desolate that no man may pass through because of the beasts
though these three men were in it as i live saith the lord god they shall deliver neither sons nor daughters they only shall be delivered but the land shall be desolate
or if i bring a sword upon that land and say sword go through the land so that i cut off man and beast from it
though these three men were in it as i live saith the lord god they shall deliver neither sons nor daughters but they only shall be delivered themselves
or if i send a pestilence into that land and pour out my fury upon it in blood to cut off from it man and beast
though noah daniel and job were in it as i live saith the lord god they shall deliver neither son nor daughter they shall but deliver their own souls by their righteousness
for thus saith the lord god how much more when i send my four sore judgments upon jerusalem the sword and the famine and the noisome beast and the pestilence to cut off from it man and beast
yet behold therein shall be left a remnant that shall be brought forth both sons and daughters behold they shall come forth unto you and ye shall see their way and their doings and ye shall be comforted concerning the evil that i have brought upon jerusalem even concerning all that i have brought upon it
and they shall comfort you when ye see their ways and their doings and ye shall know that i have not done without cause all that i have done in it saith the lord god
and the word of the lord came unto me saying
son of man what is the vine tree more than any tree or than a branch which is among the trees of the forest
shall wood be taken thereof to do any work or will men take a pin of it to hang any vessel thereon
behold it is cast into the fire for fuel the fire devoureth both the ends of it and the midst of it is burned is it meet for any work
behold when it was whole it was meet for no work how much less shall it be meet yet for any work when the fire hath devoured it and it is burned
therefore thus saith the lord god as the vine tree among the trees of the forest which i have given to the fire for fuel so will i give the inhabitants of jerusalem
and i will set my face against them they shall go out from one fire and another fire shall devour them and ye shall know that i am the lord when i set my face against them
and i will make the land desolate because they have committed a trespass saith the lord god
again the word of the lord came unto me saying
son of man cause jerusalem to know her abominations
and say thus saith the lord god unto jerusalem thy birth and thy nativity is of the land of canaan thy father was an amorite and thy mother an hittite
and as for thy nativity in the day thou wast born thy navel was not cut neither wast thou washed in water to supple thee thou wast not salted at all nor swaddled at all
none eye pitied thee to do any of these unto thee to have compassion upon thee but thou wast cast out in the open field to the lothing of thy person in the day that thou wast born
and when i passed by thee and saw thee polluted in thine own blood i said unto thee when thou wast in thy blood live yea i said unto thee when thou wast in thy blood live
i have caused thee to multiply as the bud of the field and thou hast increased and waxen great and thou art come to excellent ornaments thy breasts are fashioned and thine hair is grown whereas thou wast naked and bare
now when i passed by thee and looked upon thee behold thy time was the time of love and i spread my skirt over thee and covered thy nakedness yea i sware unto thee and entered into a covenant with thee saith the lord god and thou becamest mine
then washed i thee with water yea i throughly washed away thy blood from thee and i anointed thee with oil
i clothed thee also with broidered work and shod thee with badgers skin and i girded thee about with fine linen and i covered thee with silk
i decked thee also with ornaments and i put bracelets upon thy hands and a chain on thy neck
and i put a jewel on thy forehead and earrings in thine ears and a beautiful crown upon thine head
thus wast thou decked with gold and silver and thy raiment was of fine linen and silk and broidered work thou didst eat fine flour and honey and oil and thou wast exceeding beautiful and thou didst prosper into a kingdom
and thy renown went forth among the heathen for thy beauty for it was perfect through my comeliness which i had put upon thee saith the lord god
but thou didst trust in thine own beauty and playedst the harlot because of thy renown and pouredst out thy fornications on every one that passed by his it was
and of thy garments thou didst take and deckedst thy high places with divers colours and playedst the harlot thereupon the like things shall not come neither shall it be so
thou hast also taken thy fair jewels of my gold and of my silver which i had given thee and madest to thyself images of men and didst commit whoredom with them
and tookest thy broidered garments and coveredst them and thou hast set mine oil and mine incense before them
my meat also which i gave thee fine flour and oil and honey wherewith i fed thee thou hast even set it before them for a sweet savour and thus it was saith the lord god
moreover thou hast taken thy sons and thy daughters whom thou hast borne unto me and these hast thou sacrificed unto them to be devoured is this of thy whoredoms a small matter
that thou hast slain my children and delivered them to cause them to pass through the fire for them
and in all thine abominations and thy whoredoms thou hast not remembered the days of thy youth when thou wast naked and bare and wast polluted in thy blood
and it came to pass after all thy wickedness woe woe unto thee saith the lord god
that thou hast also built unto thee an eminent place and hast made thee an high place in every street
thou hast built thy high place at every head of the way and hast made thy beauty to be abhorred and hast opened thy feet to every one that passed by and multiplied thy whoredoms
thou hast also committed fornication with the egyptians thy neighbours great of flesh and hast increased thy whoredoms to provoke me to anger
behold therefore i have stretched out my hand over thee and have diminished thine ordinary food and delivered thee unto the will of them that hate thee the daughters of the philistines which are ashamed of thy lewd way
thou hast played the whore also with the assyrians because thou wast unsatiable yea thou hast played the harlot with them and yet couldest not be satisfied
thou hast moreover multiplied thy fornication in the land of canaan unto chaldea and yet thou wast not satisfied herewith
how weak is thine heart saith the lord god seeing thou doest all these things the work of an imperious whorish woman
in that thou buildest thine eminent place in the head of every way and makest thine high place in every street and hast not been as an harlot in that thou scornest hire
but as a wife that committeth adultery which taketh strangers instead of her husband
they give gifts to all whores but thou givest thy gifts to all thy lovers and hirest them that they may come unto thee on every side for thy whoredom
and the contrary is in thee from other women in thy whoredoms whereas none followeth thee to commit whoredoms and in that thou givest a reward and no reward is given unto thee therefore thou art contrary
wherefore o harlot hear the word of the lord
