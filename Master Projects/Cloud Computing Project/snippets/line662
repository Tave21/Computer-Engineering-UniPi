 lets the paper fall

 and dimm'd mine eyes that i can read no further
king henry vi uncle of winchester i pray read on
cardinal reads item it is further agreed between them
 that the duchies of anjou and maine shall be
 released and delivered over to the king her father
 and she sent over of the king of england's own
 proper cost and charges without having any dowry'

 and gird thee with the sword cousin of york
 we here discharge your grace from being regent
 i the parts of france till term of eighteen months
 be full expired thanks uncle winchester
 gloucester york buckingham somerset
 salisbury and warwick
 we thank you all for the great favour done
 in entertainment to my princely queen
 come let us in and with all speed provide
 to see her coronation be perform'd
 exeunt king henry vi queen margaret and suffolk
gloucester brave peers of england pillars of the state
 to you duke humphrey must unload his grief
 your grief the common grief of all the land
 what did my brother henry spend his youth
 his valour coin and people in the wars
 did he so often lodge in open field
 in winter's cold and summer's parching heat
 to conquer france his true inheritance
 and did my brother bedford toil his wits
 to keep by policy what henry got
 have you yourselves somerset buckingham
 brave york salisbury and victorious warwick
 received deep scars in france and normandy
 or hath mine uncle beaufort and myself
 with all the learned council of the realm
 studied so long sat in the councilhouse
 early and late debating to and fro
 how france and frenchmen might be kept in awe
 and had his highness in his infancy
 crowned in paris in despite of foes
 and shall these labours and these honours die
 shall henry's conquest bedford's vigilance
 your deeds of war and all our counsel die
 o peers of england shameful is this league
 fatal this marriage cancelling your fame
 blotting your names from books of memory
 razing the characters of your renown
 defacing monuments of conquer'd france
 undoing all as all had never been
cardinal nephew what means this passionate discourse
 this peroration with such circumstance
 for france tis ours and we will keep it still
gloucester ay uncle we will keep it if we can
 but now it is impossible we should
 suffolk the newmade duke that rules the roast
 hath given the duchy of anjou and maine
 unto the poor king reignier whose large style
 agrees not with the leanness of his purse
salisbury now by the death of him that died for all
 these counties were the keys of normandy
 but wherefore weeps warwick my valiant son
warwick for grief that they are past recovery
 for were there hope to conquer them again
 my sword should shed hot blood mine eyes no tears
 anjou and maine myself did win them both
 those provinces these arms of mine did conquer
 and are the cities that i got with wounds
 delivered up again with peaceful words
 mort dieu
york for suffolk's duke may he be suffocate
 that dims the honour of this warlike isle
 france should have torn and rent my very heart
 before i would have yielded to this league
 i never read but england's kings have had
 large sums of gold and dowries with their wives
 and our king henry gives away his own
 to match with her that brings no vantages
gloucester a proper jest and never heard before
 that suffolk should demand a whole fifteenth
 for costs and charges in transporting her
 she should have stayed in france and starved
 in france before
cardinal my lord of gloucester now ye grow too hot
 it was the pleasure of my lord the king
gloucester my lord of winchester i know your mind
 tis not my speeches that you do mislike
 but tis my presence that doth trouble ye
 rancour will out proud prelate in thy face
 i see thy fury if i longer stay
 we shall begin our ancient bickerings
 lordings farewell and say when i am gone
 i prophesied france will be lost ere long
 exit
cardinal so there goes our protector in a rage
 tis known to you he is mine enemy
 nay more an enemy unto you all
 and no great friend i fear me to the king
 consider lords he is the next of blood
 and heir apparent to the english crown
 had henry got an empire by his marriage
 and all the wealthy kingdoms of the west
 there's reason he should be displeased at it
 look to it lords let not his smoothing words
 bewitch your hearts be wise and circumspect
 what though the common people favour him
 calling him humphrey the good duke of
 gloucester'
 clapping their hands and crying with loud voice
 jesu maintain your royal excellence'
 with god preserve the good duke humphrey'
 i fear me lords for all this flattering gloss
 he will be found a dangerous protector
buckingham why should he then protect our sovereign
 he being of age to govern of himself
 cousin of somerset join you with me
 and all together with the duke of suffolk
 we'll quickly hoise duke humphrey from his seat
cardinal this weighty business will not brook delay
 i'll to the duke of suffolk presently
 exit
somerset cousin of buckingham though humphrey's pride
 and greatness of his place be grief to us
 yet let us watch the haughty cardinal
 his insolence is more intolerable
 than all the princes in the land beside
 if gloucester be displaced he'll be protector
buckingham or thou or i somerset will be protector
 despite duke humphrey or the cardinal
 exeunt buckingham and somerset
salisbury pride went before ambition follows him
 while these do labour for their own preferment
 behoves it us to labour for the realm
 i never saw but humphrey duke of gloucester
 did bear him like a noble gentleman
 oft have i seen the haughty cardinal
 more like a soldier than a man o the church
 as stout and proud as he were lord of all
 swear like a ruffian and demean himself
 unlike the ruler of a commonweal
 warwick my son the comfort of my age
 thy deeds thy plainness and thy housekeeping
 hath won the greatest favour of the commons
