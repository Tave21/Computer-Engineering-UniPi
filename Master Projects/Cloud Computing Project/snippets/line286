 and gladly shunn'd who gladly fled from me
montague many a morning hath he there been seen
 with tears augmenting the fresh morning dew
 adding to clouds more clouds with his deep sighs
 but all so soon as the allcheering sun
 should in the furthest east begin to draw
 the shady curtains from aurora's bed
 away from the light steals home my heavy son
 and private in his chamber pens himself
 shuts up his windows locks far daylight out
 and makes himself an artificial night
 black and portentous must this humour prove
 unless good counsel may the cause remove
benvolio my noble uncle do you know the cause
montague i neither know it nor can learn of him
benvolio have you importuned him by any means
montague both by myself and many other friends
 but he his own affections counsellor
 is to himselfi will not say how true
 but to himself so secret and so close
 so far from sounding and discovery
 as is the bud bit with an envious worm
 ere he can spread his sweet leaves to the air
 or dedicate his beauty to the sun
 could we but learn from whence his sorrows grow
 we would as willingly give cure as know
 enter romeo
benvolio see where he comes so please you step aside
 i'll know his grievance or be much denied
montague i would thou wert so happy by thy stay
 to hear true shrift come madam let's away
 exeunt montague and lady montague
benvolio goodmorrow cousin
romeo is the day so young
benvolio but new struck nine
romeo ay me sad hours seem long
 was that my father that went hence so fast
benvolio it was what sadness lengthens romeo's hours
romeo not having that which having makes them short
benvolio in love
romeo out
benvolio of love
romeo out of her favour where i am in love
benvolio alas that love so gentle in his view
 should be so tyrannous and rough in proof
romeo alas that love whose view is muffled still
 should without eyes see pathways to his will
 where shall we dine o me what fray was here
 yet tell me not for i have heard it all
 here's much to do with hate but more with love
 why then o brawling love o loving hate
 o any thing of nothing first create
 o heavy lightness serious vanity
 misshapen chaos of wellseeming forms
 feather of lead bright smoke cold fire
 sick health
 stillwaking sleep that is not what it is
 this love feel i that feel no love in this
 dost thou not laugh
benvolio no coz i rather weep
romeo good heart at what
benvolio at thy good heart's oppression
romeo why such is love's transgression
 griefs of mine own lie heavy in my breast
 which thou wilt propagate to have it prest
 with more of thine this love that thou hast shown
 doth add more grief to too much of mine own
 love is a smoke raised with the fume of sighs
 being purged a fire sparkling in lovers eyes
 being vex'd a sea nourish'd with lovers tears
 what is it else a madness most discreet
 a choking gall and a preserving sweet
 farewell my coz
benvolio soft i will go along
 an if you leave me so you do me wrong
romeo tut i have lost myself i am not here
 this is not romeo he's some other where
benvolio tell me in sadness who is that you love
romeo what shall i groan and tell thee
benvolio groan why no
 but sadly tell me who
romeo bid a sick man in sadness make his will
 ah word ill urged to one that is so ill
 in sadness cousin i do love a woman
benvolio i aim'd so near when i supposed you loved
romeo a right good markman and she's fair i love
benvolio a right fair mark fair coz is soonest hit
romeo well in that hit you miss she'll not be hit
 with cupid's arrow she hath dian's wit
 and in strong proof of chastity well arm'd
 from love's weak childish bow she lives unharm'd
 she will not stay the siege of loving terms
 nor bide the encounter of assailing eyes
 nor ope her lap to saintseducing gold
 o she is rich in beauty only poor
 that when she dies with beauty dies her store
benvolio then she hath sworn that she will still live chaste
romeo she hath and in that sparing makes huge waste
 for beauty starved with her severity
 cuts beauty off from all posterity
 she is too fair too wise wisely too fair
 to merit bliss by making me despair
 she hath forsworn to love and in that vow
 do i live dead that live to tell it now
benvolio be ruled by me forget to think of her
romeo o teach me how i should forget to think
benvolio by giving liberty unto thine eyes
 examine other beauties
romeo tis the way
 to call hers exquisite in question more
 these happy masks that kiss fair ladies brows
 being black put us in mind they hide the fair
 he that is strucken blind cannot forget
 the precious treasure of his eyesight lost
 show me a mistress that is passing fair
 what doth her beauty serve but as a note
 where i may read who pass'd that passing fair
 farewell thou canst not teach me to forget
benvolio i'll pay that doctrine or else die in debt

 and pity tis you lived at odds so long
 but now my lord what say you to my suit
capulet but saying o'er what i have said before
 my child is yet a stranger in the world
 she hath not seen the change of fourteen years
 let two more summers wither in their pride
 ere we may think her ripe to be a bride
paris younger than she are happy mothers made
capulet and too soon marr'd are those so early made
 the earth hath swallow'd all my hopes but she
 she is the hopeful lady of my earth
 but woo her gentle paris get her heart
 my will to her consent is but a part
 an she agree within her scope of choice
 lies my consent and fair according voice
 this night i hold an old accustom'd feast
 whereto i have invited many a guest
 such as i love and you among the store
 one more most welcome makes my number more
 at my poor house look to behold this night
 earthtreading stars that make dark heaven light
 such comfort as do lusty young men feel
 when wellapparell'd april on the heel
 of limping winter treads even such delight
 among fresh female buds shall you this night
 inherit at my house hear all all see
 and like her most whose merit most shall be
 which on more view of many mine being one
 may stand in number though in reckoning none
 come go with me

 whose names are written there and to them say
 my house and welcome on their pleasure stay

 writ and can never find what names the writing
 person hath here writ i must to the learnedin good time
 enter benvolio and romeo
benvolio tut man one fire burns out another's burning
 one pain is lessen'd by another's anguish
 turn giddy and be holp by backward turning
 one desperate grief cures with another's languish
 take thou some new infection to thy eye
 and the rank poison of the old will die
romeo your plaintainleaf is excellent for that
benvolio for what i pray thee
