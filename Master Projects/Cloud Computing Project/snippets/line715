act i
scene ii the same the councilchamber
 cornets enter king henry viii leaning on
 cardinal wolsey's shoulder the nobles and lovell
 cardinal wolsey places himself under king henry
 viii's feet on his right side
king henry viii my life itself and the best heart of it
 thanks you for this great care i stood i the level
 of a fullcharged confederacy and give thanks
 to you that choked it let be call'd before us
 that gentleman of buckingham's in person
 i'll hear him his confessions justify
 and point by point the treasons of his master
 he shall again relate
 a noise within crying room for the queen enter
 queen katharine ushered by norfolk and suffolk
 she kneels king henry viii riseth from his state
 takes her up kisses and placeth her by him
queen katharine nay we must longer kneel i am a suitor
king henry viii arise and take place by us half your suit
 never name to us you have half our power
 the other moiety ere you ask is given
 repeat your will and take it
queen katharine thank your majesty
 that you would love yourself and in that love
 not unconsider'd leave your honour nor
 the dignity of your office is the point
 of my petition
king henry viii lady mine proceed
queen katharine i am solicited not by a few
 and those of true condition that your subjects
 are in great grievance there have been commissions
 sent down among em which hath flaw'd the heart
 of all their loyalties wherein although
 my good lord cardinal they vent reproaches
 most bitterly on you as putter on
 of these exactions yet the king our master
 whose honour heaven shield from soileven he
 escapes not
 language unmannerly yea such which breaks
 the sides of loyalty and almost appears
 in loud rebellion
norfolk not almost appears
 it doth appear for upon these taxations
 the clothiers all not able to maintain
 the many to them longing have put off
 the spinsters carders fullers weavers who
 unfit for other life compell'd by hunger
 and lack of other means in desperate manner
 daring the event to the teeth are all in uproar
 and danger serves among then
king henry viii taxation
 wherein and what taxation my lord cardinal
 you that are blamed for it alike with us
 know you of this taxation
cardinal wolsey please you sir
 i know but of a single part in aught
 pertains to the state and front but in that file
 where others tell steps with me
queen katharine no my lord
 you know no more than others but you frame
 things that are known alike which are not wholesome
 to those which would not know them and yet must
 perforce be their acquaintance these exactions
 whereof my sovereign would have note they are
 most pestilent to the bearing and to bear em
 the back is sacrifice to the load they say
 they are devised by you or else you suffer
 too hard an exclamation
king henry viii still exaction
 the nature of it in what kind let's know
 is this exaction
queen katharine i am much too venturous
 in tempting of your patience but am bolden'd
 under your promised pardon the subjects grief
 comes through commissions which compel from each
 the sixth part of his substance to be levied
 without delay and the pretence for this
 is named your wars in france this makes bold mouths
 tongues spit their duties out and cold hearts freeze
 allegiance in them their curses now
 live where their prayers did and it's come to pass
 this tractable obedience is a slave
 to each incensed will i would your highness
 would give it quick consideration for
 there is no primer business
king henry viii by my life
 this is against our pleasure
cardinal wolsey and for me
 i have no further gone in this than by
 a single voice and that not pass'd me but
 by learned approbation of the judges if i am
 traduced by ignorant tongues which neither know
 my faculties nor person yet will be
 the chronicles of my doing let me say
 tis but the fate of place and the rough brake
 that virtue must go through we must not stint
 our necessary actions in the fear
 to cope malicious censurers which ever
 as ravenous fishes do a vessel follow
 that is newtrimm'd but benefit no further
 than vainly longing what we oft do best
 by sick interpreters once weak ones is
 not ours or not allow'd what worst as oft
 hitting a grosser quality is cried up
 for our best act if we shall stand still
 in fear our motion will be mock'd or carp'd at
 we should take root here where we sit or sit
 statestatues only
king henry viii things done well
 and with a care exempt themselves from fear
 things done without example in their issue
 are to be fear'd have you a precedent
 of this commission i believe not any
 we must not rend our subjects from our laws
 and stick them in our will sixth part of each
 a trembling contribution why we take
 from every tree lop bark and part o the timber
 and though we leave it with a root thus hack'd
 the air will drink the sap to every county
 where this is question'd send our letters with
 free pardon to each man that has denied
 the force of this commission pray look to't
 i put it to your care
cardinal wolsey a word with you
 to the secretary
 let there be letters writ to every shire
 of the king's grace and pardon the grieved commons
 hardly conceive of me let it be noised
 that through our intercession this revokement
 and pardon comes i shall anon advise you
 further in the proceeding
 exit secretary
 enter surveyor
queen katharine i am sorry that the duke of buckingham
 is run in your displeasure
king henry viii it grieves many
 the gentleman is learn'd and a most rare speaker
 to nature none more bound his training such
 that he may furnish and instruct great teachers
 and never seek for aid out of himself yet see
 when these so noble benefits shall prove
 not well disposed the mind growing once corrupt
 they turn to vicious forms ten times more ugly
 than ever they were fair this man so complete
 who was enroll'd mongst wonders and when we
 almost with ravish'd listening could not find
 his hour of speech a minute he my lady
 hath into monstrous habits put the graces
 that once were his and is become as black
 as if besmear'd in hell sit by us you shall hear
 this was his gentleman in trustof him
 things to strike honour sad bid him recount
 the forerecited practises whereof
 we cannot feel too little hear too much
cardinal wolsey stand forth and with bold spirit relate what you
 most like a careful subject have collected
 out of the duke of buckingham
king henry viii speak freely
surveyor first it was usual with him every day
 it would infect his speech that if the king
 should without issue die he'll carry it so
 to make the sceptre his these very words
 i've heard him utter to his soninlaw
 lord abergavenny to whom by oath he menaced
 revenge upon the cardinal
cardinal wolsey please your highness note
 this dangerous conception in this point
 not friended by by his wish to your high person
 his will is most malignant and it stretches
 beyond you to your friends
queen katharine my learn'd lord cardinal
 deliver all with charity
king henry viii speak on
 how grounded he his title to the crown
 upon our fail to this point hast thou heard him
 at any time speak aught
surveyor he was brought to this
 by a vain prophecy of nicholas hopkins
king henry viii what was that hopkins
surveyor sir a chartreux friar
 his confessor who fed him every minute
 with words of sovereignty
king henry viii how know'st thou this
surveyor not long before your highness sped to france
