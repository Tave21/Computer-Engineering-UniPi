 the birds chant melody on every bush
 the snake lies rolled in the cheerful sun
 the green leaves quiver with the cooling wind
 and make a chequer'd shadow on the ground
 under their sweet shade aaron let us sit
 and whilst the babbling echo mocks the hounds
 replying shrilly to the welltuned horns
 as if a double hunt were heard at once
 let us sit down and mark their yelping noise
 and after conflict such as was supposed
 the wandering prince and dido once enjoy'd
 when with a happy storm they were surprised
 and curtain'd with a counselkeeping cave
 we may each wreathed in the other's arms
 our pastimes done possess a golden slumber
 whiles hounds and horns and sweet melodious birds
 be unto us as is a nurse's song
 of lullaby to bring her babe asleep
aaron madam though venus govern your desires
 saturn is dominator over mine
 what signifies my deadlystanding eye
 my silence and my cloudy melancholy
 my fleece of woolly hair that now uncurls
 even as an adder when she doth unroll
 to do some fatal execution
 no madam these are no venereal signs
 vengeance is in my heart death in my hand
 blood and revenge are hammering in my head
 hark tamora the empress of my soul
 which never hopes more heaven than rests in thee
 this is the day of doom for bassianus
 his philomel must lose her tongue today
 thy sons make pillage of her chastity
 and wash their hands in bassianus blood
 seest thou this letter take it up i pray thee
 and give the king this fatal plotted scroll
 now question me no more we are espied
 here comes a parcel of our hopeful booty
 which dreads not yet their lives destruction
tamora ah my sweet moor sweeter to me than life
aaron no more great empress bassianus comes
 be cross with him and i'll go fetch thy sons
 to back thy quarrels whatsoe'er they be
 exit
 enter bassianus and lavinia
bassianus who have we here rome's royal empress
 unfurnish'd of her wellbeseeming troop
 or is it dian habited like her
 who hath abandoned her holy groves
 to see the general hunting in this forest
tamora saucy controller of our private steps
 had i the power that some say dian had
 thy temples should be planted presently
 with horns as was actaeon's and the hounds
 should drive upon thy newtransformed limbs
 unmannerly intruder as thou art
lavinia under your patience gentle empress
 tis thought you have a goodly gift in horning
 and to be doubted that your moor and you
 are singled forth to try experiments
 jove shield your husband from his hounds today
 tis pity they should take him for a stag
bassianus believe me queen your swarth cimmerian
 doth make your honour of his body's hue
 spotted detested and abominable
 why are you sequester'd from all your train
 dismounted from your snowwhite goodly steed
 and wander'd hither to an obscure plot
 accompanied but with a barbarous moor
 if foul desire had not conducted you
lavinia and being intercepted in your sport
 great reason that my noble lord be rated
 for sauciness i pray you let us hence
 and let her joy her ravencolour'd love
 this valley fits the purpose passing well
bassianus the king my brother shall have note of this
lavinia ay for these slips have made him noted long
 good king to be so mightily abused
tamora why have i patience to endure all this
 enter demetrius and chiron
demetrius how now dear sovereign and our gracious mother
 why doth your highness look so pale and wan
tamora have i not reason think you to look pale
 these two have ticed me hither to this place
 a barren detested vale you see it is
 the trees though summer yet forlorn and lean
 o'ercome with moss and baleful mistletoe
 here never shines the sun here nothing breeds
 unless the nightly owl or fatal raven
 and when they show'd me this abhorred pit
 they told me here at dead time of the night
 a thousand fiends a thousand hissing snakes
 ten thousand swelling toads as many urchins
 would make such fearful and confused cries
 as any mortal body hearing it
 should straight fall mad or else die suddenly
 no sooner had they told this hellish tale
 but straight they told me they would bind me here
 unto the body of a dismal yew
 and leave me to this miserable death
 and then they call'd me foul adulteress
 lascivious goth and all the bitterest terms
 that ever ear did hear to such effect
 and had you not by wondrous fortune come
 this vengeance on me had they executed
 revenge it as you love your mother's life
 or be ye not henceforth call'd my children
demetrius this is a witness that i am thy son
 stabs bassianus
chiron and this for me struck home to show my strength
 also stabs bassianus who dies
lavinia ay come semiramis nay barbarous tamora
 for no name fits thy nature but thy own
tamora give me thy poniard you shall know my boys
 your mother's hand shall right your mother's wrong
demetrius stay madam here is more belongs to her
 first thrash the corn then after burn the straw
 this minion stood upon her chastity
 upon her nuptial vow her loyalty
 and with that painted hope braves your mightiness
 and shall she carry this unto her grave
chiron an if she do i would i were an eunuch
 drag hence her husband to some secret hole
 and make his dead trunk pillow to our lust
tamora but when ye have the honey ye desire
 let not this wasp outlive us both to sting
chiron i warrant you madam we will make that sure
 come mistress now perforce we will enjoy
 that nicepreserved honesty of yours
lavinia o tamora thou bear'st a woman's face
tamora i will not hear her speak away with her
lavinia sweet lords entreat her hear me but a word
demetrius listen fair madam let it be your glory
 to see her tears but be your heart to them
 as unrelenting flint to drops of rain
lavinia when did the tiger's young ones teach the dam
 o do not learn her wrath she taught it thee
 the milk thou suck'dst from her did turn to marble
 even at thy teat thou hadst thy tyranny
 yet every mother breeds not sons alike
 to chiron
 do thou entreat her show a woman pity
chiron what wouldst thou have me prove myself a bastard
lavinia tis true the raven doth not hatch a lark
 yet have i heardo could i find it now
 the lion moved with pity did endure
 to have his princely paws pared all away
 some say that ravens foster forlorn children
 the whilst their own birds famish in their nests
 o be to me though thy hard heart say no
 nothing so kind but something pitiful
tamora i know not what it means away with her
lavinia o let me teach thee for my father's sake
 that gave thee life when well he might have
 slain thee
 be not obdurate open thy deaf ears
tamora hadst thou in person ne'er offended me
 even for his sake am i pitiless
 remember boys i pour'd forth tears in vain
 to save your brother from the sacrifice
 but fierce andronicus would not relent
 therefore away with her and use her as you will
 the worse to her the better loved of me
lavinia o tamora be call'd a gentle queen
 and with thine own hands kill me in this place
 for tis not life that i have begg'd so long
 poor i was slain when bassianus died
tamora what begg'st thou then fond woman let me go
lavinia tis present death i beg and one thing more
 that womanhood denies my tongue to tell
 o keep me from their worse than killing lust
 and tumble me into some loathsome pit
 where never man's eye may behold my body
 do this and be a charitable murderer
tamora so should i rob my sweet sons of their fee
 no let them satisfy their lust on thee
demetrius away for thou hast stay'd us here too long
lavinia no grace no womanhood ah beastly creature
 the blot and enemy to our general name
 confusion fall
chiron nay then i'll stop your mouth bring thou her husband
 this is the hole where aaron bid us hide him
 demetrius throws the body of bassianus into the
 pit then exeunt demetrius and chiron dragging
 off lavinia
tamora farewell my sons see that you make her sure
 ne'er let my heart know merry cheer indeed
 till all the andronici be made away
 now will i hence to seek my lovely moor
 and let my spleenful sons this trull deflow'r
 exit
 reenter aaron with quintus and martius
aaron come on my lords the better foot before
 straight will i bring you to the loathsome pit
 where i espied the panther fast asleep
quintus my sight is very dull whate'er it bodes
martius and mine i promise you were't not for shame
 well could i leave our sport to sleep awhile
 falls into the pit
quintus what art thou fall'n what subtle hole is this
