act iv
scene ii before albany's palace
 enter goneril and edmund
goneril welcome my lord i marvel our mild husband
 not met us on the way
 enter oswald
 now where's your master'
oswald madam within but never man so changed
 i told him of the army that was landed
 he smiled at it i told him you were coming
 his answer was the worse of gloucester's treachery
 and of the loyal service of his son
 when i inform'd him then he call'd me sot
 and told me i had turn'd the wrong side out
 what most he should dislike seems pleasant to him
 what like offensive
goneril to edmund then shall you go no further
 it is the cowish terror of his spirit
 that dares not undertake he'll not feel wrongs
 which tie him to an answer our wishes on the way
 may prove effects back edmund to my brother
 hasten his musters and conduct his powers
 i must change arms at home and give the distaff
 into my husband's hands this trusty servant
 shall pass between us ere long you are like to hear
 if you dare venture in your own behalf
 a mistress's command wear this spare speech
 giving a favour
 decline your head this kiss if it durst speak
 would stretch thy spirits up into the air
 conceive and fare thee well
edmund yours in the ranks of death
goneril my most dear gloucester
 exit edmund
 o the difference of man and man
 to thee a woman's services are due
 my fool usurps my body
oswald madam here comes my lord
 exit
 enter albany
goneril i have been worth the whistle
albany o goneril
 you are not worth the dust which the rude wind
 blows in your face i fear your disposition
 that nature which contemns its origin
 cannot be border'd certain in itself
 she that herself will sliver and disbranch
 from her material sap perforce must wither
 and come to deadly use
goneril no more the text is foolish
albany wisdom and goodness to the vile seem vile
 filths savour but themselves what have you done
 tigers not daughters what have you perform'd
 a father and a gracious aged man
 whose reverence even the headlugg'd bear would lick
 most barbarous most degenerate have you madded
 could my good brother suffer you to do it
 a man a prince by him so benefited
 if that the heavens do not their visible spirits
 send quickly down to tame these vile offences
 it will come
 humanity must perforce prey on itself
 like monsters of the deep
goneril milkliver'd man
 that bear'st a cheek for blows a head for wrongs
 who hast not in thy brows an eye discerning
 thine honour from thy suffering that not know'st
 fools do those villains pity who are punish'd
 ere they have done their mischief where's thy drum
 france spreads his banners in our noiseless land
 with plumed helm thy slayer begins threats
 whiles thou a moral fool sit'st still and criest
 alack why does he so'
albany see thyself devil
 proper deformity seems not in the fiend
 so horrid as in woman
goneril o vain fool
albany thou changed and selfcover'd thing for shame
 bemonster not thy feature were't my fitness
 to let these hands obey my blood
 they are apt enough to dislocate and tear
 thy flesh and bones howe'er thou art a fiend
 a woman's shape doth shield thee
goneril marry your manhood now
 enter a messenger
albany what news
messenger o my good lord the duke of cornwall's dead
 slain by his servant going to put out
 the other eye of gloucester
albany gloucester's eye
messenger a servant that he bred thrill'd with remorse
 opposed against the act bending his sword
 to his great master who thereat enraged
 flew on him and amongst them fell'd him dead
 but not without that harmful stroke which since
 hath pluck'd him after
albany this shows you are above
 you justicers that these our nether crimes
 so speedily can venge but o poor gloucester
 lost he his other eye
messenger both both my lord
 this letter madam craves a speedy answer
 tis from your sister
goneril aside one way i like this well
 but being widow and my gloucester with her
 may all the building in my fancy pluck
 upon my hateful life another way
 the news is not so tarti'll read and answer
 exit
albany where was his son when they did take his eyes
messenger come with my lady hither
albany he is not here
messenger no my good lord i met him back again
albany knows he the wickedness
messenger ay my good lord twas he inform'd against him
 and quit the house on purpose that their punishment
 might have the freer course
albany gloucester i live
 to thank thee for the love thou show'dst the king
 and to revenge thine eyes come hither friend
 tell me what more thou know'st

act iv
scene iii the french camp near dover
 enter kent and a gentleman
kent why the king of france is so suddenly gone back
 know you the reason
gentleman something he left imperfect in the
 state which since his coming forth is thought
 of which imports to the kingdom so much
 fear and danger that his personal return was
 most required and necessary
kent who hath he left behind him general
gentleman the marshal of france monsieur la far
kent did your letters pierce the queen to any
 demonstration of grief
gentleman ay sir she took them read them in my presence
 and now and then an ample tear trill'd down
 her delicate cheek it seem'd she was a queen
 over her passion who most rebellike
 sought to be king o'er her
kent o then it moved her
gentleman not to a rage patience and sorrow strove
 who should express her goodliest you have seen
 sunshine and rain at once her smiles and tears
 were like a better way those happy smilets
 that play'd on her ripe lip seem'd not to know
 what guests were in her eyes which parted thence
 as pearls from diamonds dropp'd in brief
 sorrow would be a rarity most beloved
 if all could so become it
kent made she no verbal question
gentleman faith once or twice she heaved the name of father'
 pantingly forth as if it press'd her heart
 cried sisters sisters shame of ladies sisters
 kent father sisters what i the storm i the night
 let pity not be believed there she shook
 the holy water from her heavenly eyes
 and clamour moisten'd then away she started
 to deal with grief alone
kent it is the stars
 the stars above us govern our conditions
 else one self mate and mate could not beget
 such different issues you spoke not with her since
gentleman no
kent was this before the king return'd
gentleman no since
kent well sir the poor distressed lear's i the town
 who sometime in his better tune remembers
 what we are come about and by no means
 will yield to see his daughter
gentleman why good sir
kent a sovereign shame so elbows him his own unkindness
 that stripp'd her from his benediction turn'd her
 to foreign casualties gave her dear rights
 to his doghearted daughters these things sting
 his mind so venomously that burning shame
 detains him from cordelia
gentleman alack poor gentleman
kent of albany's and cornwall's powers you heard not
gentleman tis so they are afoot
kent well sir i'll bring you to our master lear
 and leave you to attend him some dear cause
 will in concealment wrap me up awhile
 when i am known aright you shall not grieve
 lending me this acquaintance i pray you go
 along with me

act iv
scene iv the same a tent
 enter with drum and colours cordelia doctor and soldiers
cordelia alack tis he why he was met even now
 as mad as the vex'd sea singing aloud
 crown'd with rank fumiter and furrowweeds
 with burdocks hemlock nettles cuckooflowers
 darnel and all the idle weeds that grow
 in our sustaining corn a century send forth
 search every acre in the highgrown field
