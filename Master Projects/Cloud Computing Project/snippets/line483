 awake the pert and nimble spirit of mirth
 turn melancholy forth to funerals
 the pale companion is not for our pomp
 exit philostrate
 hippolyta i woo'd thee with my sword
 and won thy love doing thee injuries
 but i will wed thee in another key
 with pomp with triumph and with revelling
 enter egeus hermia lysander and demetrius
egeus happy be theseus our renowned duke
theseus thanks good egeus what's the news with thee
egeus full of vexation come i with complaint
 against my child my daughter hermia
 stand forth demetrius my noble lord
 this man hath my consent to marry her
 stand forth lysander and my gracious duke
 this man hath bewitch'd the bosom of my child
 thou thou lysander thou hast given her rhymes
 and interchanged lovetokens with my child
 thou hast by moonlight at her window sung
 with feigning voice verses of feigning love
 and stolen the impression of her fantasy
 with bracelets of thy hair rings gawds conceits
 knacks trifles nosegays sweetmeats messengers
 of strong prevailment in unharden'd youth
 with cunning hast thou filch'd my daughter's heart
 turn'd her obedience which is due to me
 to stubborn harshness and my gracious duke
 be it so she will not here before your grace
 consent to marry with demetrius
 i beg the ancient privilege of athens
 as she is mine i may dispose of her
 which shall be either to this gentleman
 or to her death according to our law
 immediately provided in that case
theseus what say you hermia be advised fair maid
 to you your father should be as a god
 one that composed your beauties yea and one
 to whom you are but as a form in wax
 by him imprinted and within his power
 to leave the figure or disfigure it
 demetrius is a worthy gentleman
hermia so is lysander
theseus in himself he is
 but in this kind wanting your father's voice
 the other must be held the worthier
hermia i would my father look'd but with my eyes
theseus rather your eyes must with his judgment look
hermia i do entreat your grace to pardon me
 i know not by what power i am made bold
 nor how it may concern my modesty
 in such a presence here to plead my thoughts
 but i beseech your grace that i may know
 the worst that may befall me in this case
 if i refuse to wed demetrius
theseus either to die the death or to abjure
 for ever the society of men
 therefore fair hermia question your desires
 know of your youth examine well your blood
 whether if you yield not to your father's choice
 you can endure the livery of a nun
 for aye to be in shady cloister mew'd
 to live a barren sister all your life
 chanting faint hymns to the cold fruitless moon
 thriceblessed they that master so their blood
 to undergo such maiden pilgrimage
 but earthlier happy is the rose distill'd
 than that which withering on the virgin thorn
 grows lives and dies in single blessedness
hermia so will i grow so live so die my lord
 ere i will my virgin patent up
 unto his lordship whose unwished yoke
 my soul consents not to give sovereignty
theseus take time to pause and by the nest new moon
 the sealingday betwixt my love and me
 for everlasting bond of fellowship
 upon that day either prepare to die
 for disobedience to your father's will
 or else to wed demetrius as he would
 or on diana's altar to protest
 for aye austerity and single life
demetrius relent sweet hermia and lysander yield
 thy crazed title to my certain right
lysander you have her father's love demetrius
 let me have hermia's do you marry him
egeus scornful lysander true he hath my love
 and what is mine my love shall render him
 and she is mine and all my right of her
 i do estate unto demetrius
lysander i am my lord as well derived as he
 as well possess'd my love is more than his
 my fortunes every way as fairly rank'd
 if not with vantage as demetrius'
 and which is more than all these boasts can be
 i am beloved of beauteous hermia
 why should not i then prosecute my right
 demetrius i'll avouch it to his head
 made love to nedar's daughter helena
 and won her soul and she sweet lady dotes
 devoutly dotes dotes in idolatry
 upon this spotted and inconstant man
theseus i must confess that i have heard so much
 and with demetrius thought to have spoke thereof
 but being overfull of selfaffairs
 my mind did lose it but demetrius come
 and come egeus you shall go with me
 i have some private schooling for you both
 for you fair hermia look you arm yourself
 to fit your fancies to your father's will
 or else the law of athens yields you up
 which by no means we may extenuate
 to death or to a vow of single life
 come my hippolyta what cheer my love
 demetrius and egeus go along
 i must employ you in some business
 against our nuptial and confer with you
 of something nearly that concerns yourselves
egeus with duty and desire we follow you
 exeunt all but lysander and hermia
lysander how now my love why is your cheek so pale
 how chance the roses there do fade so fast
hermia belike for want of rain which i could well
 beteem them from the tempest of my eyes
lysander ay me for aught that i could ever read
 could ever hear by tale or history
 the course of true love never did run smooth
 but either it was different in blood
hermia o cross too high to be enthrall'd to low
lysander or else misgraffed in respect of years
hermia o spite too old to be engaged to young
lysander or else it stood upon the choice of friends
hermia o hell to choose love by another's eyes
lysander or if there were a sympathy in choice
 war death or sickness did lay siege to it
 making it momentany as a sound
 swift as a shadow short as any dream
 brief as the lightning in the collied night
 that in a spleen unfolds both heaven and earth
 and ere a man hath power to say behold'
 the jaws of darkness do devour it up
 so quick bright things come to confusion
hermia if then true lovers have been ever cross'd
 it stands as an edict in destiny
 then let us teach our trial patience
 because it is a customary cross
 as due to love as thoughts and dreams and sighs
 wishes and tears poor fancy's followers
lysander a good persuasion therefore hear me hermia
 i have a widow aunt a dowager
 of great revenue and she hath no child
 from athens is her house remote seven leagues
 and she respects me as her only son
 there gentle hermia may i marry thee
 and to that place the sharp athenian law
 cannot pursue us if thou lovest me then
 steal forth thy father's house tomorrow night
 and in the wood a league without the town
 where i did meet thee once with helena
 to do observance to a morn of may
 there will i stay for thee
hermia my good lysander
 i swear to thee by cupid's strongest bow
 by his best arrow with the golden head
 by the simplicity of venus doves
 by that which knitteth souls and prospers loves
 and by that fire which burn'd the carthage queen
 when the false troyan under sail was seen
 by all the vows that ever men have broke
 in number more than ever women spoke
 in that same place thou hast appointed me
 tomorrow truly will i meet with thee
lysander keep promise love look here comes helena
 enter helena
hermia god speed fair helena whither away
helena call you me fair that fair again unsay
 demetrius loves your fair o happy fair
 your eyes are lodestars and your tongue's sweet air
 more tuneable than lark to shepherd's ear
 when wheat is green when hawthorn buds appear
 sickness is catching o were favour so
 yours would i catch fair hermia ere i go
 my ear should catch your voice my eye your eye
 my tongue should catch your tongue's sweet melody
 were the world mine demetrius being bated
 the rest i'd give to be to you translated
 o teach me how you look and with what art
 you sway the motion of demetrius heart
hermia i frown upon him yet he loves me still
helena o that your frowns would teach my smiles such skill
hermia i give him curses yet he gives me love
helena o that my prayers could such affection move
hermia the more i hate the more he follows me
helena the more i love the more he hateth me
hermia his folly helena is no fault of mine
helena none but your beauty would that fault were mine
hermia take comfort he no more shall see my face
 lysander and myself will fly this place
 before the time i did lysander see
 seem'd athens as a paradise to me
 o then what graces in my love do dwell
