 remove your thought it doth abuse your bosom
 if any wretch have put this in your head
 let heaven requite it with the serpent's curse
 for if she be not honest chaste and true
 there's no man happy the purest of their wives
 is foul as slander
othello bid her come hither go
 exit emilia
 she says enough yet she's a simple bawd
 that cannot say as much this is a subtle whore
 a closet lock and key of villanous secrets
 and yet she'll kneel and pray i have seen her do't
 enter desdemona with emilia
desdemona my lord what is your will
othello pray chuck come hither
desdemona what is your pleasure
othello let me see your eyes
 look in my face
desdemona what horrible fancy's this
othello to emilia some of your function mistress
 leave procreants alone and shut the door
 cough or cry hem if any body come
 your mystery your mystery nay dispatch
 exit emilia
desdemona upon my knees what doth your speech import
 i understand a fury in your words
 but not the words
othello why what art thou
desdemona your wife my lord your true
 and loyal wife
othello come swear it damn thyself
 lest being like one of heaven the devils themselves
 should fear to seize thee therefore be double damn'd
 swear thou art honest
desdemona heaven doth truly know it
othello heaven truly knows that thou art false as hell
desdemona to whom my lord with whom how am i false
othello o desdemona away away away
desdemona alas the heavy day why do you weep
 am i the motive of these tears my lord
 if haply you my father do suspect
 an instrument of this your calling back
 lay not your blame on me if you have lost him
 why i have lost him too
othello had it pleased heaven
 to try me with affliction had they rain'd
 all kinds of sores and shames on my bare head
 steep'd me in poverty to the very lips
 given to captivity me and my utmost hopes
 i should have found in some place of my soul
 a drop of patience but alas to make me
 a fixed figure for the time of scorn
 to point his slow unmoving finger at
 yet could i bear that too well very well
 but there where i have garner'd up my heart
 where either i must live or bear no life
 the fountain from the which my current runs
 or else dries up to be discarded thence
 or keep it as a cistern for foul toads
 to knot and gender in turn thy complexion there
 patience thou young and roselipp'd cherubin
 ay there look grim as hell
desdemona i hope my noble lord esteems me honest
othello o ay as summer flies are in the shambles
 that quicken even with blowing o thou weed
 who art so lovely fair and smell'st so sweet
 that the sense aches at thee would thou hadst
 ne'er been born
desdemona alas what ignorant sin have i committed
othello was this fair paper this most goodly book
 made to write whore upon what committed
 committed o thou public commoner
 i should make very forges of my cheeks
 that would to cinders burn up modesty
 did i but speak thy deeds what committed
 heaven stops the nose at it and the moon winks
 the bawdy wind that kisses all it meets
 is hush'd within the hollow mine of earth
 and will not hear it what committed
 impudent strumpet
desdemona by heaven you do me wrong
othello are you not a strumpet
desdemona no as i am a christian
 if to preserve this vessel for my lord
 from any other foul unlawful touch
 be not to be a strumpet i am none
othello what not a whore
desdemona no as i shall be saved
othello is't possible
desdemona o heaven forgive us
othello i cry you mercy then
 i took you for that cunning whore of venice
 that married with othello
 raising his voice
 you mistress
 that have the office opposite to saint peter
 and keep the gate of hell
 reenter emilia
 you you ay you
 we have done our course there's money for your pains
 i pray you turn the key and keep our counsel
 exit
emilia alas what does this gentleman conceive
 how do you madam how do you my good lady
desdemona faith half asleep
emilia good madam what's the matter with my lord
desdemona with who
emilia why with my lord madam
desdemona who is thy lord
emilia he that is yours sweet lady
desdemona i have none do not talk to me emilia
 i cannot weep nor answer have i none
 but what should go by water prithee tonight
 lay on my bed my wedding sheets remember
 and call thy husband hither
emilia here's a change indeed
 exit
desdemona tis meet i should be used so very meet
 how have i been behaved that he might stick
 the small'st opinion on my least misuse
 reenter emilia with iago
iago what is your pleasure madam
 how is't with you
desdemona i cannot tell those that do teach young babes
 do it with gentle means and easy tasks
 he might have chid me so for in good faith
 i am a child to chiding
iago what's the matter lady
emilia alas iago my lord hath so bewhored her
 thrown such despite and heavy terms upon her
 as true hearts cannot bear
desdemona am i that name iago
iago what name fair lady
desdemona such as she says my lord did say i was
emilia he call'd her whore a beggar in his drink
 could not have laid such terms upon his callat
iago why did he so
desdemona i do not know i am sure i am none such
iago do not weep do not weep alas the day
emilia hath she forsook so many noble matches
 her father and her country and her friends
 to be call'd whore would it not make one weep
desdemona it is my wretched fortune
iago beshrew him for't
 how comes this trick upon him
desdemona nay heaven doth know
emilia i will be hang'd if some eternal villain
 some busy and insinuating rogue
 some cogging cozening slave to get some office
 have not devised this slander i'll be hang'd else
iago fie there is no such man it is impossible
desdemona if any such there be heaven pardon him
emilia a halter pardon him and hell gnaw his bones
 why should he call her whore who keeps her company
 what place what time what form what likelihood
 the moor's abused by some most villanous knave
 some base notorious knave some scurvy fellow
 o heaven that such companions thou'ldst unfold
 and put in every honest hand a whip
 to lash the rascals naked through the world
 even from the east to the west
iago speak within door
emilia o fie upon them some such squire he was
 that turn'd your wit the seamy side without
 and made you to suspect me with the moor
iago you are a fool go to
desdemona o good iago
 what shall i do to win my lord again
 good friend go to him for by this light of heaven
 i know not how i lost him here i kneel
 if e'er my will did trespass gainst his love
 either in discourse of thought or actual deed
 or that mine eyes mine ears or any sense
 delighted them in any other form
 or that i do not yet and ever did
 and ever willthough he do shake me off
 to beggarly divorcementlove him dearly
 comfort forswear me unkindness may do much
 and his unkindness may defeat my life
 but never taint my love i cannot say whore'
 it does abhor me now i speak the word
 to do the act that might the addition earn
 not the world's mass of vanity could make me
iago i pray you be content tis but his humour
 the business of the state does him offence
 and he does chide with you
desdemona if twere no other
iago tis but so i warrant
 trumpets within
 hark how these instruments summon to supper
 the messengers of venice stay the meat
 go in and weep not all things shall be well
 exeunt desdemona and emilia
 enter roderigo
 how now roderigo
roderigo i do not find that thou dealest justly with me
iago what in the contrary
roderigo every day thou daffest me with some device iago
 and rather as it seems to me now keepest from me
 all conveniency than suppliest me with the least
