 the nightingale if she should sing by day
 when every goose is cackling would be thought
 no better a musician than the wren
 how many things by season season'd are
 to their right praise and true perfection
 peace ho the moon sleeps with endymion
 and would not be awaked
 music ceases
lorenzo that is the voice
 or i am much deceived of portia
portia he knows me as the blind man knows the cuckoo
 by the bad voice
lorenzo dear lady welcome home
portia we have been praying for our husbands healths
 which speed we hope the better for our words
 are they return'd
lorenzo madam they are not yet
 but there is come a messenger before
 to signify their coming
portia go in nerissa
 give order to my servants that they take
 no note at all of our being absent hence
 nor you lorenzo jessica nor you
 a tucket sounds
lorenzo your husband is at hand i hear his trumpet
 we are no telltales madam fear you not
portia this night methinks is but the daylight sick
 it looks a little paler tis a day
 such as the day is when the sun is hid
 enter bassanio antonio gratiano and
 their followers
bassanio we should hold day with the antipodes
 if you would walk in absence of the sun
portia let me give light but let me not be light
 for a light wife doth make a heavy husband
 and never be bassanio so for me
 but god sort all you are welcome home my lord
bassanio i thank you madam give welcome to my friend
 this is the man this is antonio
 to whom i am so infinitely bound
portia you should in all sense be much bound to him
 for as i hear he was much bound for you
antonio no more than i am well acquitted of
portia sir you are very welcome to our house
 it must appear in other ways than words
 therefore i scant this breathing courtesy
gratiano to nerissa by yonder moon i swear you do me wrong
 in faith i gave it to the judge's clerk
 would he were gelt that had it for my part
 since you do take it love so much at heart
portia a quarrel ho already what's the matter
gratiano about a hoop of gold a paltry ring
 that she did give me whose posy was
 for all the world like cutler's poetry
 upon a knife love me and leave me not'
nerissa what talk you of the posy or the value
 you swore to me when i did give it you
 that you would wear it till your hour of death
 and that it should lie with you in your grave
 though not for me yet for your vehement oaths
 you should have been respective and have kept it
 gave it a judge's clerk no god's my judge
 the clerk will ne'er wear hair on's face that had it
gratiano he will an if he live to be a man
nerissa ay if a woman live to be a man
gratiano now by this hand i gave it to a youth
 a kind of boy a little scrubbed boy
 no higher than thyself the judge's clerk
 a prating boy that begg'd it as a fee
 i could not for my heart deny it him
portia you were to blame i must be plain with you
 to part so slightly with your wife's first gift
 a thing stuck on with oaths upon your finger
 and so riveted with faith unto your flesh
 i gave my love a ring and made him swear
 never to part with it and here he stands
 i dare be sworn for him he would not leave it
 nor pluck it from his finger for the wealth
 that the world masters now in faith gratiano
 you give your wife too unkind a cause of grief
 an twere to me i should be mad at it
bassanio aside why i were best to cut my left hand off
 and swear i lost the ring defending it
gratiano my lord bassanio gave his ring away
 unto the judge that begg'd it and indeed
 deserved it too and then the boy his clerk
 that took some pains in writing he begg'd mine
 and neither man nor master would take aught
 but the two rings
portia what ring gave you my lord
 not that i hope which you received of me
bassanio if i could add a lie unto a fault
 i would deny it but you see my finger
 hath not the ring upon it it is gone
portia even so void is your false heart of truth
 by heaven i will ne'er come in your bed
 until i see the ring
nerissa nor i in yours
 till i again see mine
bassanio sweet portia
 if you did know to whom i gave the ring
 if you did know for whom i gave the ring
 and would conceive for what i gave the ring
 and how unwillingly i left the ring
 when nought would be accepted but the ring
 you would abate the strength of your displeasure
portia if you had known the virtue of the ring
 or half her worthiness that gave the ring
 or your own honour to contain the ring
 you would not then have parted with the ring
 what man is there so much unreasonable
 if you had pleased to have defended it
 with any terms of zeal wanted the modesty
 to urge the thing held as a ceremony
 nerissa teaches me what to believe
 i'll die for't but some woman had the ring
bassanio no by my honour madam by my soul
 no woman had it but a civil doctor
 which did refuse three thousand ducats of me
 and begg'd the ring the which i did deny him
 and suffer'd him to go displeased away
 even he that did uphold the very life
 of my dear friend what should i say sweet lady
 i was enforced to send it after him
 i was beset with shame and courtesy
 my honour would not let ingratitude
 so much besmear it pardon me good lady
 for by these blessed candles of the night
 had you been there i think you would have begg'd
 the ring of me to give the worthy doctor
portia let not that doctor e'er come near my house
 since he hath got the jewel that i loved
 and that which you did swear to keep for me
 i will become as liberal as you
 i'll not deny him any thing i have
 no not my body nor my husband's bed
 know him i shall i am well sure of it
 lie not a night from home watch me like argus
 if you do not if i be left alone
 now by mine honour which is yet mine own
 i'll have that doctor for my bedfellow
nerissa and i his clerk therefore be well advised
 how you do leave me to mine own protection
gratiano well do you so let not me take him then
 for if i do i'll mar the young clerk's pen
antonio i am the unhappy subject of these quarrels
portia sir grieve not you you are welcome notwithstanding
bassanio portia forgive me this enforced wrong
 and in the hearing of these many friends
 i swear to thee even by thine own fair eyes
 wherein i see myself
portia mark you but that
 in both my eyes he doubly sees himself
 in each eye one swear by your double self
 and there's an oath of credit
bassanio nay but hear me
 pardon this fault and by my soul i swear
 i never more will break an oath with thee
antonio i once did lend my body for his wealth
 which but for him that had your husband's ring
 had quite miscarried i dare be bound again
 my soul upon the forfeit that your lord
 will never more break faith advisedly
portia then you shall be his surety give him this
 and bid him keep it better than the other
antonio here lord bassanio swear to keep this ring
bassanio by heaven it is the same i gave the doctor
portia i had it of him pardon me bassanio
 for by this ring the doctor lay with me
nerissa and pardon me my gentle gratiano
 for that same scrubbed boy the doctor's clerk
 in lieu of this last night did lie with me
gratiano why this is like the mending of highways
 in summer where the ways are fair enough
 what are we cuckolds ere we have deserved it
portia speak not so grossly you are all amazed
 here is a letter read it at your leisure
 it comes from padua from bellario
 there you shall find that portia was the doctor
 nerissa there her clerk lorenzo here
 shall witness i set forth as soon as you
 and even but now return'd i have not yet
 enter'd my house antonio you are welcome
 and i have better news in store for you
 than you expect unseal this letter soon
 there you shall find three of your argosies
 are richly come to harbour suddenly
 you shall not know by what strange accident
 i chanced on this letter
antonio i am dumb
bassanio were you the doctor and i knew you not
gratiano were you the clerk that is to make me cuckold
nerissa ay but the clerk that never means to do it
 unless he live until he be a man
bassanio sweet doctor you shall be my bedfellow
 when i am absent then lie with my wife
antonio sweet lady you have given me life and living
 for here i read for certain that my ships
 are safely come to road
portia how now lorenzo
