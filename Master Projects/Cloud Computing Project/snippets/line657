 are brought to the correction of your law
 there is not now a rebel's sword unsheath'd
 but peace puts forth her olive every where
 the manner how this action hath been borne
 here at more leisure may your highness read
 with every course in his particular
king henry iv o westmoreland thou art a summer bird
 which ever in the haunch of winter sings
 the lifting up of day
 enter harcourt
 look here's more news
harcourt from enemies heaven keep your majesty
 and when they stand against you may they fall
 as those that i am come to tell you of
 the earl northumberland and the lord bardolph
 with a great power of english and of scots
 are by the sheriff of yorkshire overthrown
 the manner and true order of the fight
 this packet please it you contains at large
king henry iv and wherefore should these good news make me sick
 will fortune never come with both hands full
 but write her fair words still in foulest letters
 she either gives a stomach and no food
 such are the poor in health or else a feast
 and takes away the stomach such are the rich
 that have abundance and enjoy it not
 i should rejoice now at this happy news
 and now my sight fails and my brain is giddy
 o me come near me now i am much ill
gloucester comfort your majesty
clarence o my royal father
westmoreland my sovereign lord cheer up yourself look up
warwick be patient princes you do know these fits
 are with his highness very ordinary
 stand from him give him air he'll straight be well
clarence no no he cannot long hold out these pangs
 the incessant care and labour of his mind
 hath wrought the mure that should confine it in
 so thin that life looks through and will break out
gloucester the people fear me for they do observe
 unfather'd heirs and loathly births of nature
 the seasons change their manners as the year
 had found some months asleep and leap'd them over
clarence the river hath thrice flow'd no ebb between
 and the old folk time's doting chronicles
 say it did so a little time before
 that our greatgrandsire edward sick'd and died
warwick speak lower princes for the king recovers
gloucester this apoplexy will certain be his end
king henry iv i pray you take me up and bear me hence
 into some other chamber softly pray
 2 king henry iv
act iv
scene v another chamber
 king henry iv lying on a bed clarence
 gloucester warwick and others in attendance
king henry iv let there be no noise made my gentle friends
 unless some dull and favourable hand
 will whisper music to my weary spirit
warwick call for the music in the other room
king henry iv set me the crown upon my pillow here
clarence his eye is hollow and he changes much
warwick less noise less noise
 enter prince henry
prince henry who saw the duke of clarence
clarence i am here brother full of heaviness
prince henry how now rain within doors and none abroad
 how doth the king
gloucester exceeding ill
prince henry heard he the good news yet
 tell it him
gloucester he alter'd much upon the hearing it
prince henry if he be sick with joy he'll recover without physic
warwick not so much noise my lords sweet prince
 speak low
 the king your father is disposed to sleep
clarence let us withdraw into the other room
warwick will't please your grace to go along with us
prince henry no i will sit and watch here by the king
 exeunt all but prince henry
 why doth the crown lie there upon his pillow
 being so troublesome a bedfellow
 o polish'd perturbation golden care
 that keep'st the ports of slumber open wide
 to many a watchful night sleep with it now
 yet not so sound and half so deeply sweet
 as he whose brow with homely biggen bound
 snores out the watch of night o majesty
 when thou dost pinch thy bearer thou dost sit
 like a rich armour worn in heat of day
 that scalds with safety by his gates of breath
 there lies a downy feather which stirs not
 did he suspire that light and weightless down
 perforce must move my gracious lord my father
 this sleep is sound indeed this is a sleep
 that from this golden rigol hath divorced
 so many english kings thy due from me
 is tears and heavy sorrows of the blood
 which nature love and filial tenderness
 shall o dear father pay thee plenteously
 my due from thee is this imperial crown
 which as immediate as thy place and blood
 derives itself to me lo here it sits
 which god shall guard and put the world's whole strength
 into one giant arm it shall not force
 this lineal honour from me this from thee
 will i to mine leave as tis left to me
 exit
king henry iv warwick gloucester clarence
 reenter warwick gloucester clarence and the rest
clarence doth the king call
warwick what would your majesty how fares your grace
king henry iv why did you leave me here alone my lords
clarence we left the prince my brother here my liege
 who undertook to sit and watch by you
king henry iv the prince of wales where is he let me see him
 he is not here
warwick this door is open he is gone this way
gloucester he came not through the chamber where we stay'd
king henry iv where is the crown who took it from my pillow
warwick when we withdrew my liege we left it here
king henry iv the prince hath ta'en it hence go seek him out
 is he so hasty that he doth suppose
 my sleep my death
 find him my lord of warwick chide him hither
 exit warwick
 this part of his conjoins with my disease
 and helps to end me see sons what things you are
 how quickly nature falls into revolt
 when gold becomes her object
 for this the foolish overcareful fathers
 have broke their sleep with thoughts their brains with care
 their bones with industry
 for this they have engrossed and piled up
 the canker'd heaps of strangeachieved gold
 for this they have been thoughtful to invest
 their sons with arts and martial exercises
 when like the bee culling from every flower
 the virtuous sweets
 our thighs pack'd with wax our mouths with honey
 we bring it to the hive and like the bees
 are murdered for our pains this bitter taste
 yield his engrossments to the ending father
 reenter warwick
 now where is he that will not stay so long
 till his friend sickness hath determined me
warwick my lord i found the prince in the next room
 washing with kindly tears his gentle cheeks
 with such a deep demeanor in great sorrow
 that tyranny which never quaff'd but blood
 would by beholding him have wash'd his knife
 with gentle eyedrops he is coming hither
king henry iv but wherefore did he take away the crown
 reenter prince henry
 lo where he comes come hither to me harry
 depart the chamber leave us here alone
 exeunt warwick and the rest
prince henry i never thought to hear you speak again
king henry iv thy wish was father harry to that thought
 i stay too long by thee i weary thee
 dost thou so hunger for mine empty chair
 that thou wilt needs invest thee with my honours
 before thy hour be ripe o foolish youth
 thou seek'st the greatness that will o'erwhelm thee
 stay but a little for my cloud of dignity
 is held from falling with so weak a wind
 that it will quickly drop my day is dim
 thou hast stolen that which after some few hours
 were thine without offence and at my death
 thou hast seal'd up my expectation
 thy life did manifest thou lovedst me not
 and thou wilt have me die assured of it
 thou hidest a thousand daggers in thy thoughts
 which thou hast whetted on thy stony heart
 to stab at half an hour of my life
 what canst thou not forbear me half an hour
 then get thee gone and dig my grave thyself
 and bid the merry bells ring to thine ear
 that thou art crowned not that i am dead
 let all the tears that should bedew my hearse
 be drops of balm to sanctify thy head
 only compound me with forgotten dust
 give that which gave thee life unto the worms
 pluck down my officers break my decrees
 for now a time is come to mock at form
 harry the fifth is crown'd up vanity
 down royal state all you sage counsellors hence
 and to the english court assemble now
 from every region apes of idleness
 now neighbour confines purge you of your scum
 have you a ruffian that will swear drink dance
 revel the night rob murder and commit
 the oldest sins the newest kind of ways
 be happy he will trouble you no more
 england shall double gild his treble guilt
 england shall give him office honour might
 for the fifth harry from curb'd licence plucks
 the muzzle of restraint and the wild dog
 shall flesh his tooth on every innocent
 o my poor kingdom sick with civil blows
