act iv
scene i rome titus's garden
 enter young lucius and lavinia running after him
 and the boy flies from her with books under his
 arm then enter titus and marcus
young lucius help grandsire help my aunt lavinia
 follows me every where i know not why
 good uncle marcus see how swift she comes
 alas sweet aunt i know not what you mean
marcus andronicus stand by me lucius do not fear thine aunt
titus andronicus she loves thee boy too well to do thee harm
young lucius ay when my father was in rome she did
marcus andronicus what means my niece lavinia by these signs
titus andronicus fear her not lucius somewhat doth she mean
 see lucius see how much she makes of thee
 somewhither would she have thee go with her
 ah boy cornelia never with more care
 read to her sons than she hath read to thee
 sweet poetry and tully's orator
marcus andronicus canst thou not guess wherefore she plies thee thus
young lucius my lord i know not i nor can i guess
 unless some fit or frenzy do possess her
 for i have heard my grandsire say full oft
 extremity of griefs would make men mad
 and i have read that hecuba of troy
 ran mad through sorrow that made me to fear
 although my lord i know my noble aunt
 loves me as dear as e'er my mother did
 and would not but in fury fright my youth
 which made me down to throw my books and fly
 causeless perhaps but pardon me sweet aunt
 and madam if my uncle marcus go
 i will most willingly attend your ladyship
marcus andronicus lucius i will
 lavinia turns over with her stumps the books which
 lucius has let fall
titus andronicus how now lavinia marcus what means this
 some book there is that she desires to see
 which is it girl of these open them boy
 but thou art deeper read and better skill'd
 come and take choice of all my library
 and so beguile thy sorrow till the heavens
 reveal the damn'd contriver of this deed
 why lifts she up her arms in sequence thus
marcus andronicus i think she means that there was more than one
 confederate in the fact ay more there was
 or else to heaven she heaves them for revenge
titus andronicus lucius what book is that she tosseth so
young lucius grandsire tis ovid's metamorphoses
 my mother gave it me
marcus andronicus for love of her that's gone
 perhaps she cull'd it from among the rest
titus andronicus soft see how busily she turns the leaves
 helping her
 what would she find lavinia shall i read
 this is the tragic tale of philomel
 and treats of tereus treason and his rape
 and rape i fear was root of thine annoy
marcus andronicus see brother see note how she quotes the leaves
titus andronicus lavinia wert thou thus surprised sweet girl
 ravish'd and wrong'd as philomela was
 forced in the ruthless vast and gloomy woods see see
 ay such a place there is where we did hunt
 o had we never never hunted there
 pattern'd by that the poet here describes
 by nature made for murders and for rapes
marcus andronicus o why should nature build so foul a den
 unless the gods delight in tragedies
titus andronicus give signs sweet girl for here are none
 but friends
 what roman lord it was durst do the deed
 or slunk not saturnine as tarquin erst
 that left the camp to sin in lucrece bed
marcus andronicus sit down sweet niece brother sit down by me
 apollo pallas jove or mercury
 inspire me that i may this treason find
 my lord look here look here lavinia
 this sandy plot is plain guide if thou canst
 this after me when i have writ my name
 without the help of any hand at all
 he writes his name with his staff and guides it
 with feet and mouth
 cursed be that heart that forced us to this shift
 write thou good niece and here display at last
 what god will have discover'd for revenge
 heaven guide thy pen to print thy sorrows plain
 that we may know the traitors and the truth
 she takes the staff in her mouth and guides it
 with her stumps and writes
titus andronicus o do ye read my lord what she hath writ
 stuprum chiron demetrius'
marcus andronicus what what the lustful sons of tamora
 performers of this heinous bloody deed
titus andronicus magni dominator poli
 tam lentus audis scelera tam lentus vides
marcus andronicus o calm thee gentle lord although i know
 there is enough written upon this earth
 to stir a mutiny in the mildest thoughts
 and arm the minds of infants to exclaims
 my lord kneel down with me lavinia kneel
 and kneel sweet boy the roman hector's hope
 and swear with me as with the woful fere
 and father of that chaste dishonour'd dame
 lord junius brutus sware for lucrece rape
 that we will prosecute by good advice
 mortal revenge upon these traitorous goths
 and see their blood or die with this reproach
titus andronicus tis sure enough an you knew how
 but if you hunt these bearwhelps then beware
 the dam will wake and if she wind you once
 she's with the lion deeply still in league
 and lulls him whilst she playeth on her back
 and when he sleeps will she do what she list
 you are a young huntsman marcus let it alone
 and come i will go get a leaf of brass
 and with a gad of steel will write these words
 and lay it by the angry northern wind
 will blow these sands like sibyl's leaves abroad
 and where's your lesson then boy what say you
young lucius i say my lord that if i were a man
 their mother's bedchamber should not be safe
 for these bad bondmen to the yoke of rome
marcus andronicus ay that's my boy thy father hath full oft
 for his ungrateful country done the like
young lucius and uncle so will i an if i live
titus andronicus come go with me into mine armoury
 lucius i'll fit thee and withal my boy
 shalt carry from me to the empress sons
 presents that i intend to send them both
 come come thou'lt do thy message wilt thou not
young lucius ay with my dagger in their bosoms grandsire
titus andronicus no boy not so i'll teach thee another course
 lavinia come marcus look to my house
 lucius and i'll go brave it at the court
 ay marry will we sir and we'll be waited on
 exeunt titus lavinia and young lucius
marcus andronicus o heavens can you hear a good man groan
 and not relent or not compassion him
 marcus attend him in his ecstasy
 that hath more scars of sorrow in his heart
 than foemen's marks upon his batter'd shield
 but yet so just that he will not revenge
 revenge ye heavens for old andronicus
 exit
 titus andronicus
act iv
scene ii the same a room in the palace
 enter from one side aaron demetrius and
 chiron from the other side young lucius and an
 attendant with a bundle of weapons and verses
 writ upon them
chiron demetrius here's the son of lucius
 he hath some message to deliver us
aaron ay some mad message from his mad grandfather
young lucius my lords with all the humbleness i may
 i greet your honours from andronicus
 aside
 and pray the roman gods confound you both
demetrius gramercy lovely lucius what's the news
young lucius aside that you are both decipher'd that's the news
 for villains mark'd with rapemay it please you
 my grandsire well advised hath sent by me
 the goodliest weapons of his armoury
 to gratify your honourable youth
 the hope of rome for so he bade me say
 and so i do and with his gifts present
 your lordships that whenever you have need
 you may be armed and appointed well
 and so i leave you both
 aside
 like bloody villains
 exeunt young lucius and attendant
demetrius what's here a scroll and written round about
 let's see
 reads
 integer vitae scelerisque purus
 non eget mauri jaculis nec arcu'
chiron o tis a verse in horace i know it well
 i read it in the grammar long ago
aaron ay just a verse in horace right you have it
 aside
 now what a thing it is to be an ass
 here's no sound jest the old man hath found their guilt
 and sends them weapons wrapped about with lines
 that wound beyond their feeling to the quick
 but were our witty empress well afoot
 she would applaud andronicus conceit
 but let her rest in her unrest awhile
 and now young lords was't not a happy star
 led us to rome strangers and more than so
 captives to be advanced to this height
 it did me good before the palace gate
 to brave the tribune in his brother's hearing
demetrius but me more good to see so great a lord
 basely insinuate and send us gifts
aaron had he not reason lord demetrius
 did you not use his daughter very friendly
demetrius i would we had a thousand roman dames
 at such a bay by turn to serve our lust
chiron a charitable wish and full of love
