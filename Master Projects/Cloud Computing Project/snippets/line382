 if he for gold will give us any food
 i faint almost to death
touchstone holla you clown
rosalind peace fool he's not thy kinsman
corin who calls
touchstone your betters sir
corin else are they very wretched
rosalind peace i say good even to you friend
corin and to you gentle sir and to you all
rosalind i prithee shepherd if that love or gold
 can in this desert place buy entertainment
 bring us where we may rest ourselves and feed
 here's a young maid with travel much oppress'd
 and faints for succor
corin fair sir i pity her
 and wish for her sake more than for mine own
 my fortunes were more able to relieve her
 but i am shepherd to another man
 and do not shear the fleeces that i graze
 my master is of churlish disposition
 and little recks to find the way to heaven
 by doing deeds of hospitality
 besides his cote his flocks and bounds of feed
 are now on sale and at our sheepcote now
 by reason of his absence there is nothing
 that you will feed on but what is come see
 and in my voice most welcome shall you be
rosalind what is he that shall buy his flock and pasture
corin that young swain that you saw here but erewhile
 that little cares for buying any thing
rosalind i pray thee if it stand with honesty
 buy thou the cottage pasture and the flock
 and thou shalt have to pay for it of us
celia and we will mend thy wages i like this place
 and willingly could waste my time in it
corin assuredly the thing is to be sold
 go with me if you like upon report
 the soil the profit and this kind of life
 i will your very faithful feeder be
 and buy it with your gold right suddenly

scene v the forest
 enter amiens jaques and others
 
 song
amiens under the greenwood tree
 who loves to lie with me
 and turn his merry note
 unto the sweet bird's throat
 come hither come hither come hither
 here shall he see no enemy
 but winter and rough weather
jaques more more i prithee more
amiens it will make you melancholy monsieur jaques
jaques i thank it more i prithee more i can suck
 melancholy out of a song as a weasel sucks eggs
 more i prithee more
amiens my voice is ragged i know i cannot please you
jaques i do not desire you to please me i do desire you to
 sing come more another stanzo call you em stanzos
amiens what you will monsieur jaques
jaques nay i care not for their names they owe me
 nothing will you sing
amiens more at your request than to please myself
jaques well then if ever i thank any man i'll thank you
 but that they call compliment is like the encounter
 of two dogapes and when a man thanks me heartily
 methinks i have given him a penny and he renders me
 the beggarly thanks come sing and you that will
 not hold your tongues
amiens well i'll end the song sirs cover the while the
 duke will drink under this tree he hath been all
 this day to look you
jaques and i have been all this day to avoid him he is
 too disputable for my company i think of as many
 matters as he but i give heaven thanks and make no
 boast of them come warble come
 
 song
 who doth ambition shun
 all together here
 and loves to live i the sun
 seeking the food he eats
 and pleased with what he gets
 come hither come hither come hither
 here shall he see no enemy
 but winter and rough weather
jaques i'll give you a verse to this note that i made
 yesterday in despite of my invention
amiens and i'll sing it
jaques thus it goes
 if it do come to pass
 that any man turn ass
 leaving his wealth and ease
 a stubborn will to please
 ducdame ducdame ducdame
 here shall he see
 gross fools as he
 an if he will come to me
amiens what's that ducdame'
jaques tis a greek invocation to call fools into a
 circle i'll go sleep if i can if i cannot i'll
 rail against all the firstborn of egypt
amiens and i'll go seek the duke his banquet is prepared

scene vi the forest
 enter orlando and adam
adam dear master i can go no further o i die for food
 here lie i down and measure out my grave farewell
 kind master

scene vii the forest
 a table set out enter duke senior amiens and
 lords like outlaws
duke senior i think he be transform'd into a beast
 for i can no where find him like a man
first lord my lord he is but even now gone hence
 here was he merry hearing of a song
duke senior if he compact of jars grow musical
 we shall have shortly discord in the spheres
 go seek him tell him i would speak with him
 enter jaques
first lord he saves my labour by his own approach
duke senior why how now monsieur what a life is this
 that your poor friends must woo your company
 what you look merrily
jaques a fool a fool i met a fool i the forest
 a motley fool a miserable world
 as i do live by food i met a fool
 who laid him down and bask'd him in the sun
 and rail'd on lady fortune in good terms
 in good set terms and yet a motley fool
 good morrow fool quoth i no sir quoth he
 call me not fool till heaven hath sent me fortune'
 and then he drew a dial from his poke
 and looking on it with lacklustre eye
 says very wisely it is ten o'clock
 thus we may see quoth he how the world wags
 tis but an hour ago since it was nine
 and after one hour more twill be eleven
 and so from hour to hour we ripe and ripe
 and then from hour to hour we rot and rot
 and thereby hangs a tale when i did hear
 the motley fool thus moral on the time
 my lungs began to crow like chanticleer
 that fools should be so deepcontemplative
 and i did laugh sans intermission
 an hour by his dial o noble fool
 a worthy fool motley's the only wear
duke senior what fool is this
jaques o worthy fool one that hath been a courtier
 and says if ladies be but young and fair
 they have the gift to know it and in his brain
 which is as dry as the remainder biscuit
 after a voyage he hath strange places cramm'd
 with observation the which he vents
 in mangled forms o that i were a fool
 i am ambitious for a motley coat
duke senior thou shalt have one
jaques it is my only suit
 provided that you weed your better judgments
 of all opinion that grows rank in them
 that i am wise i must have liberty
 withal as large a charter as the wind
 to blow on whom i please for so fools have
 and they that are most galled with my folly
 they most must laugh and why sir must they so
 the why is plain as way to parish church
 he that a fool doth very wisely hit
 doth very foolishly although he smart
 not to seem senseless of the bob if not
 the wise man's folly is anatomized
 even by the squandering glances of the fool
 invest me in my motley give me leave
 to speak my mind and i will through and through
 cleanse the foul body of the infected world
 if they will patiently receive my medicine
duke senior fie on thee i can tell what thou wouldst do
jaques what for a counter would i do but good
