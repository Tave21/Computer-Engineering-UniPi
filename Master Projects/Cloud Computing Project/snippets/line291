friar laurence holy saint francis what a change is here
 is rosaline whom thou didst love so dear
 so soon forsaken young men's love then lies
 not truly in their hearts but in their eyes
 jesu maria what a deal of brine
 hath wash'd thy sallow cheeks for rosaline
 how much salt water thrown away in waste
 to season love that of it doth not taste
 the sun not yet thy sighs from heaven clears
 thy old groans ring yet in my ancient ears
 lo here upon thy cheek the stain doth sit
 of an old tear that is not wash'd off yet
 if e'er thou wast thyself and these woes thine
 thou and these woes were all for rosaline
 and art thou changed pronounce this sentence then
 women may fall when there's no strength in men
romeo thou chid'st me oft for loving rosaline
friar laurence for doting not for loving pupil mine
romeo and bad'st me bury love
friar laurence not in a grave
 to lay one in another out to have
romeo i pray thee chide not she whom i love now
 doth grace for grace and love for love allow
 the other did not so
friar laurence o she knew well
 thy love did read by rote and could not spell
 but come young waverer come go with me
 in one respect i'll thy assistant be
 for this alliance may so happy prove
 to turn your households rancour to pure love
romeo o let us hence i stand on sudden haste
friar laurence wisely and slow they stumble that run fast
 exeunt
 romeo and juliet
act ii
scene iv a street
 enter benvolio and mercutio
mercutio where the devil should this romeo be
 came he not home tonight
benvolio not to his father's i spoke with his man
mercutio ah that same pale hardhearted wench that rosaline
 torments him so that he will sure run mad
benvolio tybalt the kinsman of old capulet
 hath sent a letter to his father's house
mercutio a challenge on my life
benvolio romeo will answer it
mercutio any man that can write may answer a letter
benvolio nay he will answer the letter's master how he
 dares being dared
mercutio alas poor romeo he is already dead stabbed with a
 white wench's black eye shot through the ear with a
 lovesong the very pin of his heart cleft with the
 blind bowboy's buttshaft and is he a man to
 encounter tybalt
benvolio why what is tybalt
mercutio more than prince of cats i can tell you o he is
 the courageous captain of compliments he fights as
 you sing pricksong keeps time distance and
 proportion rests me his minim rest one two and
 the third in your bosom the very butcher of a silk
 button a duellist a duellist a gentleman of the
 very first house of the first and second cause
 ah the immortal passado the punto reverso the
 hai
benvolio the what
mercutio the pox of such antic lisping affecting
 fantasticoes these new tuners of accents by jesu
 a very good blade a very tall man a very good
 whore why is not this a lamentable thing
 grandsire that we should be thus afflicted with
 these strange flies these fashionmongers these
 perdonami's who stand so much on the new form
 that they cannot at ease on the old bench o their
 bones their bones
 enter romeo
benvolio here comes romeo here comes romeo
mercutio without his roe like a dried herring flesh flesh
 how art thou fishified now is he for the numbers
 that petrarch flowed in laura to his lady was but a
 kitchenwench marry she had a better love to
 berhyme her dido a dowdy cleopatra a gipsy
 helen and hero hildings and harlots thisbe a grey
 eye or so but not to the purpose signior
 romeo bon jour there's a french salutation
 to your french slop you gave us the counterfeit
 fairly last night
romeo good morrow to you both what counterfeit did i give you
mercutio the ship sir the slip can you not conceive
romeo pardon good mercutio my business was great and in
 such a case as mine a man may strain courtesy
mercutio that's as much as to say such a case as yours
 constrains a man to bow in the hams
romeo meaning to court'sy
mercutio thou hast most kindly hit it
romeo a most courteous exposition
mercutio nay i am the very pink of courtesy
romeo pink for flower
mercutio right
romeo why then is my pump well flowered
mercutio well said follow me this jest now till thou hast
 worn out thy pump that when the single sole of it
 is worn the jest may remain after the wearing sole singular
romeo o singlesoled jest solely singular for the
 singleness
mercutio come between us good benvolio my wits faint
romeo switch and spurs switch and spurs or i'll cry a match
mercutio nay if thy wits run the wildgoose chase i have
 done for thou hast more of the wildgoose in one of
 thy wits than i am sure i have in my whole five
 was i with you there for the goose
romeo thou wast never with me for any thing when thou wast
 not there for the goose
mercutio i will bite thee by the ear for that jest
romeo nay good goose bite not
mercutio thy wit is a very bitter sweeting it is a most
 sharp sauce
romeo and is it not well served in to a sweet goose
mercutio o here's a wit of cheveril that stretches from an
 inch narrow to an ell broad
romeo i stretch it out for that word broad which added
 to the goose proves thee far and wide a broad goose
mercutio why is not this better now than groaning for love
 now art thou sociable now art thou romeo now art
 thou what thou art by art as well as by nature
 for this drivelling love is like a great natural
 that runs lolling up and down to hide his bauble in a hole
benvolio stop there stop there
mercutio thou desirest me to stop in my tale against the hair
benvolio thou wouldst else have made thy tale large
mercutio o thou art deceived i would have made it short
 for i was come to the whole depth of my tale and
 meant indeed to occupy the argument no longer
romeo here's goodly gear
 enter nurse and peter
mercutio a sail a sail
benvolio two two a shirt and a smock
nurse peter

 mar

 quoth a gentlemen can any of you tell me where i
 may find the young romeo

mercutio no hare sir unless a hare sir in a lenten pie
 that is something stale and hoar ere it be spent
 sings
 an old hare hoar
 and an old hare hoar
 is very good meat in lent
 but a hare that is hoar
 is too much for a score
 when it hoars ere it be spent

 to dinner thither

mercutio farewell ancient lady farewell
 singing

 down an a were lustier than he is and twenty such
 jacks and if i cannot i'll find those that shall
 scurvy knave i am none of his flirtgills i am
