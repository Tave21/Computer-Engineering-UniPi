they have set up kings but not by me they have made princes and i knew it not of their silver and their gold have they made them idols that they may be cut off
thy calf o samaria hath cast thee off mine anger is kindled against them how long will it be ere they attain to innocency
for from israel was it also the workman made it therefore it is not god but the calf of samaria shall be broken in pieces
for they have sown the wind and they shall reap the whirlwind it hath no stalk the bud shall yield no meal if so be it yield the strangers shall swallow it up
israel is swallowed up now shall they be among the gentiles as a vessel wherein is no pleasure
for they are gone up to assyria a wild ass alone by himself ephraim hath hired lovers
yea though they have hired among the nations now will i gather them and they shall sorrow a little for the burden of the king of princes
because ephraim hath made many altars to sin altars shall be unto him to sin
i have written to him the great things of my law but they were counted as a strange thing
they sacrifice flesh for the sacrifices of mine offerings and eat it but the lord accepteth them not now will he remember their iniquity and visit their sins they shall return to egypt
for israel hath forgotten his maker and buildeth temples and judah hath multiplied fenced cities but i will send a fire upon his cities and it shall devour the palaces thereof
rejoice not o israel for joy as other people for thou hast gone a whoring from thy god thou hast loved a reward upon every cornfloor
the floor and the winepress shall not feed them and the new wine shall fail in her
they shall not dwell in the lord's land but ephraim shall return to egypt and they shall eat unclean things in assyria
they shall not offer wine offerings to the lord neither shall they be pleasing unto him their sacrifices shall be unto them as the bread of mourners all that eat thereof shall be polluted for their bread for their soul shall not come into the house of the lord
what will ye do in the solemn day and in the day of the feast of the lord
for lo they are gone because of destruction egypt shall gather them up memphis shall bury them the pleasant places for their silver nettles shall possess them thorns shall be in their tabernacles
the days of visitation are come the days of recompence are come israel shall know it the prophet is a fool the spiritual man is mad for the multitude of thine iniquity and the great hatred
the watchman of ephraim was with my god but the prophet is a snare of a fowler in all his ways and hatred in the house of his god
they have deeply corrupted themselves as in the days of gibeah therefore he will remember their iniquity he will visit their sins
i found israel like grapes in the wilderness i saw your fathers as the firstripe in the fig tree at her first time but they went to baalpeor and separated themselves unto that shame and their abominations were according as they loved
as for ephraim their glory shall fly away like a bird from the birth and from the womb and from the conception
though they bring up their children yet will i bereave them that there shall not be a man left yea woe also to them when i depart from them
ephraim as i saw tyrus is planted in a pleasant place but ephraim shall bring forth his children to the murderer
give them o lord what wilt thou give give them a miscarrying womb and dry breasts
all their wickedness is in gilgal for there i hated them for the wickedness of their doings i will drive them out of mine house i will love them no more all their princes are revolters
ephraim is smitten their root is dried up they shall bear no fruit yea though they bring forth yet will i slay even the beloved fruit of their womb
my god will cast them away because they did not hearken unto him and they shall be wanderers among the nations
israel is an empty vine he bringeth forth fruit unto himself according to the multitude of his fruit he hath increased the altars according to the goodness of his land they have made goodly images
their heart is divided now shall they be found faulty he shall break down their altars he shall spoil their images
for now they shall say we have no king because we feared not the lord what then should a king do to us
they have spoken words swearing falsely in making a covenant thus judgment springeth up as hemlock in the furrows of the field
the inhabitants of samaria shall fear because of the calves of bethaven for the people thereof shall mourn over it and the priests thereof that rejoiced on it for the glory thereof because it is departed from it
it shall be also carried unto assyria for a present to king jareb ephraim shall receive shame and israel shall be ashamed of his own counsel
as for samaria her king is cut off as the foam upon the water
the high places also of aven the sin of israel shall be destroyed the thorn and the thistle shall come up on their altars and they shall say to the mountains cover us and to the hills fall on us
o israel thou hast sinned from the days of gibeah there they stood the battle in gibeah against the children of iniquity did not overtake them
it is in my desire that i should chastise them and the people shall be gathered against them when they shall bind themselves in their two furrows
and ephraim is as an heifer that is taught and loveth to tread out the corn but i passed over upon her fair neck i will make ephraim to ride judah shall plow and jacob shall break his clods
sow to yourselves in righteousness reap in mercy break up your fallow ground for it is time to seek the lord till he come and rain righteousness upon you
ye have plowed wickedness ye have reaped iniquity ye have eaten the fruit of lies because thou didst trust in thy way in the multitude of thy mighty men
therefore shall a tumult arise among thy people and all thy fortresses shall be spoiled as shalman spoiled betharbel in the day of battle the mother was dashed in pieces upon her children
so shall bethel do unto you because of your great wickedness in a morning shall the king of israel utterly be cut off
when israel was a child then i loved him and called my son out of egypt
as they called them so they went from them they sacrificed unto baalim and burned incense to graven images
i taught ephraim also to go taking them by their arms but they knew not that i healed them
i drew them with cords of a man with bands of love and i was to them as they that take off the yoke on their jaws and i laid meat unto them
he shall not return into the land of egypt but the assyrian shall be his king because they refused to return
and the sword shall abide on his cities and shall consume his branches and devour them because of their own counsels
and my people are bent to backsliding from me though they called them to the most high none at all would exalt him
how shall i give thee up ephraim how shall i deliver thee israel how shall i make thee as admah how shall i set thee as zeboim mine heart is turned within me my repentings are kindled together
i will not execute the fierceness of mine anger i will not return to destroy ephraim for i am god and not man the holy one in the midst of thee and i will not enter into the city
they shall walk after the lord he shall roar like a lion when he shall roar then the children shall tremble from the west
they shall tremble as a bird out of egypt and as a dove out of the land of assyria and i will place them in their houses saith the lord
ephraim compasseth me about with lies and the house of israel with deceit but judah yet ruleth with god and is faithful with the saints
ephraim feedeth on wind and followeth after the east wind he daily increaseth lies and desolation and they do make a covenant with the assyrians and oil is carried into egypt
the lord hath also a controversy with judah and will punish jacob according to his ways according to his doings will he recompense him
he took his brother by the heel in the womb and by his strength he had power with god
yea he had power over the angel and prevailed he wept and made supplication unto him he found him in bethel and there he spake with us
even the lord god of hosts the lord is his memorial
therefore turn thou to thy god keep mercy and judgment and wait on thy god continually
he is a merchant the balances of deceit are in his hand he loveth to oppress
and ephraim said yet i am become rich i have found me out substance in all my labours they shall find none iniquity in me that were sin
and i that am the lord thy god from the land of egypt will yet make thee to dwell in tabernacles as in the days of the solemn feast
i have also spoken by the prophets and i have multiplied visions and used similitudes by the ministry of the prophets
is there iniquity in gilead surely they are vanity they sacrifice bullocks in gilgal yea their altars are as heaps in the furrows of the fields
and jacob fled into the country of syria and israel served for a wife and for a wife he kept sheep
and by a prophet the lord brought israel out of egypt and by a prophet was he preserved
ephraim provoked him to anger most bitterly therefore shall he leave his blood upon him and his reproach shall his lord return unto him
when ephraim spake trembling he exalted himself in israel but when he offended in baal he died
and now they sin more and more and have made them molten images of their silver and idols according to their own understanding all of it the work of the craftsmen they say of them let the men that sacrifice kiss the calves
therefore they shall be as the morning cloud and as the early dew that passeth away as the chaff that is driven with the whirlwind out of the floor and as the smoke out of the chimney
yet i am the lord thy god from the land of egypt and thou shalt know no god but me for there is no saviour beside me
i did know thee in the wilderness in the land of great drought
according to their pasture so were they filled they were filled and their heart was exalted therefore have they forgotten me
therefore i will be unto them as a lion as a leopard by the way will i observe them
i will meet them as a bear that is bereaved of her whelps and will rend the caul of their heart and there will i devour them like a lion the wild beast shall tear them
o israel thou hast destroyed thyself but in me is thine help
i will be thy king where is any other that may save thee in all thy cities and thy judges of whom thou saidst give me a king and princes
i gave thee a king in mine anger and took him away in my wrath
the iniquity of ephraim is bound up his sin is hid
the sorrows of a travailing woman shall come upon him he is an unwise son for he should not stay long in the place of the breaking forth of children
i will ransom them from the power of the grave i will redeem them from death o death i will be thy plagues o grave i will be thy destruction repentance shall be hid from mine eyes
though he be fruitful among his brethren an east wind shall come the wind of the lord shall come up from the wilderness and his spring shall become dry and his fountain shall be dried up he shall spoil the treasure of all pleasant vessels
samaria shall become desolate for she hath rebelled against her god they shall fall by the sword their infants shall be dashed in pieces and their women with child shall be ripped up
o israel return unto the lord thy god for thou hast fallen by thine iniquity
take with you words and turn to the lord say unto him take away all iniquity and receive us graciously so will we render the calves of our lips
asshur shall not save us we will not ride upon horses neither will we say any more to the work of our hands ye are our gods for in thee the fatherless findeth mercy
i will heal their backsliding i will love them freely for mine anger is turned away from him
i will be as the dew unto israel he shall grow as the lily and cast forth his roots as lebanon
his branches shall spread and his beauty shall be as the olive tree and his smell as lebanon
they that dwell under his shadow shall return they shall revive as the corn and grow as the vine the scent thereof shall be as the wine of lebanon
ephraim shall say what have i to do any more with idols i have heard him and observed him i am like a green fir tree from me is thy fruit found
who is wise and he shall understand these things prudent and he shall know them for the ways of the lord are right and the just shall walk in them but the transgressors shall fall therein
the word of the lord that came to joel the son of pethuel
hear this ye old men and give ear all ye inhabitants of the land hath this been in your days or even in the days of your fathers
tell ye your children of it and let your children tell their children and their children another generation
that which the palmerworm hath left hath the locust eaten and that which the locust hath left hath the cankerworm eaten and that which the cankerworm hath left hath the caterpiller eaten
awake ye drunkards and weep and howl all ye drinkers of wine because of the new wine for it is cut off from your mouth
for a nation is come up upon my land strong and without number whose teeth are the teeth of a lion and he hath the cheek teeth of a great lion
he hath laid my vine waste and barked my fig tree he hath made it clean bare and cast it away the branches thereof are made white
lament like a virgin girded with sackcloth for the husband of her youth
the meat offering and the drink offering is cut off from the house of the lord the priests the lord's ministers mourn
the field is wasted the land mourneth for the corn is wasted the new wine is dried up the oil languisheth
be ye ashamed o ye husbandmen howl o ye vinedressers for the wheat and for the barley because the harvest of the field is perished
the vine is dried up and the fig tree languisheth the pomegranate tree the palm tree also and the apple tree even all the trees of the field are withered because joy is withered away from the sons of men
gird yourselves and lament ye priests howl ye ministers of the altar come lie all night in sackcloth ye ministers of my god for the meat offering and the drink offering is withholden from the house of your god
sanctify ye a fast call a solemn assembly gather the elders and all the inhabitants of the land into the house of the lord your god and cry unto the lord
alas for the day for the day of the lord is at hand and as a destruction from the almighty shall it come
is not the meat cut off before our eyes yea joy and gladness from the house of our god
the seed is rotten under their clods the garners are laid desolate the barns are broken down for the corn is withered
how do the beasts groan the herds of cattle are perplexed because they have no pasture yea the flocks of sheep are made desolate
o lord to thee will i cry for the fire hath devoured the pastures of the wilderness and the flame hath burned all the trees of the field
the beasts of the field cry also unto thee for the rivers of waters are dried up and the fire hath devoured the pastures of the wilderness
blow ye the trumpet in zion and sound an alarm in my holy mountain let all the inhabitants of the land tremble for the day of the lord cometh for it is nigh at hand
a day of darkness and of gloominess a day of clouds and of thick darkness as the morning spread upon the mountains a great people and a strong there hath not been ever the like neither shall be any more after it even to the years of many generations
a fire devoureth before them and behind them a flame burneth the land is as the garden of eden before them and behind them a desolate wilderness yea and nothing shall escape them
the appearance of them is as the appearance of horses and as horsemen so shall they run
like the noise of chariots on the tops of mountains shall they leap like the noise of a flame of fire that devoureth the stubble as a strong people set in battle array
before their face the people shall be much pained all faces shall gather blackness
they shall run like mighty men they shall climb the wall like men of war and they shall march every one on his ways and they shall not break their ranks
neither shall one thrust another they shall walk every one in his path and when they fall upon the sword they shall not be wounded
they shall run to and fro in the city they shall run upon the wall they shall climb up upon the houses they shall enter in at the windows like a thief
the earth shall quake before them the heavens shall tremble the sun and the moon shall be dark and the stars shall withdraw their shining
and the lord shall utter his voice before his army for his camp is very great for he is strong that executeth his word for the day of the lord is great and very terrible and who can abide it
therefore also now saith the lord turn ye even to me with all your heart and with fasting and with weeping and with mourning
and rend your heart and not your garments and turn unto the lord your god for he is gracious and merciful slow to anger and of great kindness and repenteth him of the evil
who knoweth if he will return and repent and leave a blessing behind him even a meat offering and a drink offering unto the lord your god
blow the trumpet in zion sanctify a fast call a solemn assembly
gather the people sanctify the congregation assemble the elders gather the children and those that suck the breasts let the bridegroom go forth of his chamber and the bride out of her closet
let the priests the ministers of the lord weep between the porch and the altar and let them say spare thy people o lord and give not thine heritage to reproach that the heathen should rule over them wherefore should they say among the people where is their god
then will the lord be jealous for his land and pity his people
yea the lord will answer and say unto his people behold i will send you corn and wine and oil and ye shall be satisfied therewith and i will no more make you a reproach among the heathen
but i will remove far off from you the northern army and will drive him into a land barren and desolate with his face toward the east sea and his hinder part toward the utmost sea and his stink shall come up and his ill savour shall come up because he hath done great things
fear not o land be glad and rejoice for the lord will do great things
be not afraid ye beasts of the field for the pastures of the wilderness do spring for the tree beareth her fruit the fig tree and the vine do yield their strength
be glad then ye children of zion and rejoice in the lord your god for he hath given you the former rain moderately and he will cause to come down for you the rain the former rain and the latter rain in the first month
and the floors shall be full of wheat and the vats shall overflow with wine and oil
and i will restore to you the years that the locust hath eaten the cankerworm and the caterpiller and the palmerworm my great army which i sent among you
and ye shall eat in plenty and be satisfied and praise the name of the lord your god that hath dealt wondrously with you and my people shall never be ashamed
and ye shall know that i am in the midst of israel and that i am the lord your god and none else and my people shall never be ashamed

for behold in those days and in that time when i shall bring again the captivity of judah and jerusalem
i will also gather all nations and will bring them down into the valley of jehoshaphat and will plead with them there for my people and for my heritage israel whom they have scattered among the nations and parted my land
and they have cast lots for my people and have given a boy for an harlot and sold a girl for wine that they might drink
yea and what have ye to do with me o tyre and zidon and all the coasts of palestine will ye render me a recompence and if ye recompense me swiftly and speedily will i return your recompence upon your own head
because ye have taken my silver and my gold and have carried into your temples my goodly pleasant things
the children also of judah and the children of jerusalem have ye sold unto the grecians that ye might remove them far from their border
behold i will raise them out of the place whither ye have sold them and will return your recompence upon your own head
and i will sell your sons and your daughters into the hand of the children of judah and they shall sell them to the sabeans to a people far off for the lord hath spoken it

so shall ye know that i am the lord your god dwelling in zion my holy mountain then shall jerusalem be holy and there shall no strangers pass through her any more
and it shall come to pass in that day that the mountains shall drop down new wine and the hills shall flow with milk and all the rivers of judah shall flow with waters and a fountain shall come forth of the house of the lord and shall water the valley of shittim
egypt shall be a desolation and edom shall be a desolate wilderness for the violence against the children of judah because they have shed innocent blood in their land
but judah shall dwell for ever and jerusalem from generation to generation
for i will cleanse their blood that i have not cleansed for the lord dwelleth in zion
the words of amos who was among the herdmen of tekoa which he saw concerning israel in the days of uzziah king of judah and in the days of jeroboam the son of joash king of israel two years before the earthquake

and they lay themselves down upon clothes laid to pledge by every altar and they drink the wine of the condemned in the house of their god
yet destroyed i the amorite before them whose height was like the height of the cedars and he was strong as the oaks yet i destroyed his fruit from above and his roots from beneath
also i brought you up from the land of egypt and led you forty years through the wilderness to possess the land of the amorite
and i raised up of your sons for prophets and of your young men for nazarites is it not even thus o ye children of israel saith the lord
but ye gave the nazarites wine to drink and commanded the prophets saying prophesy not
behold i am pressed under you as a cart is pressed that is full of sheaves
therefore the flight shall perish from the swift and the strong shall not strengthen his force neither shall the mighty deliver himself
neither shall he stand that handleth the bow and he that is swift of foot shall not deliver himself neither shall he that rideth the horse deliver himself
and he that is courageous among the mighty shall flee away naked in that day saith the lord

you only have i known of all the families of the earth therefore i will punish you for all your iniquities
