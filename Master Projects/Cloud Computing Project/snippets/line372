act iv
scene ii florence the widow's house
 enter bertram and diana
bertram they told me that your name was fontibell
diana no my good lord diana
bertram titled goddess
 and worth it with addition but fair soul
 in your fine frame hath love no quality
 if quick fire of youth light not your mind
 you are no maiden but a monument
 when you are dead you should be such a one
 as you are now for you are cold and stem
 and now you should be as your mother was
 when your sweet self was got
diana she then was honest
bertram so should you be
diana no
 my mother did but duty such my lord
 as you owe to your wife
bertram no more o that
 i prithee do not strive against my vows
 i was compell'd to her but i love thee
 by love's own sweet constraint and will for ever
 do thee all rights of service
diana ay so you serve us
 till we serve you but when you have our roses
 you barely leave our thorns to prick ourselves
 and mock us with our bareness
bertram how have i sworn
diana tis not the many oaths that makes the truth
 but the plain single vow that is vow'd true
 what is not holy that we swear not by
 but take the high'st to witness then pray you tell me
 if i should swear by god's great attributes
 i loved you dearly would you believe my oaths
 when i did love you ill this has no holding
 to swear by him whom i protest to love
 that i will work against him therefore your oaths
 are words and poor conditions but unseal'd
 at least in my opinion
bertram change it change it
 be not so holycruel love is holy
 and my integrity ne'er knew the crafts
 that you do charge men with stand no more off
 but give thyself unto my sick desires
 who then recover say thou art mine and ever
 my love as it begins shall so persever
diana i see that men make ropes in such a scarre
 that we'll forsake ourselves give me that ring
bertram i'll lend it thee my dear but have no power
 to give it from me
diana will you not my lord
bertram it is an honour longing to our house
 bequeathed down from many ancestors
 which were the greatest obloquy i the world
 in me to lose
diana mine honour's such a ring
 my chastity's the jewel of our house
 bequeathed down from many ancestors
 which were the greatest obloquy i the world
 in me to lose thus your own proper wisdom
 brings in the champion honour on my part
 against your vain assault
bertram here take my ring
 my house mine honour yea my life be thine
 and i'll be bid by thee
diana when midnight comes knock at my chamberwindow
 i'll order take my mother shall not hear
 now will i charge you in the band of truth
 when you have conquer'd my yet maiden bed
 remain there but an hour nor speak to me
 my reasons are most strong and you shall know them
 when back again this ring shall be deliver'd
 and on your finger in the night i'll put
 another ring that what in time proceeds
 may token to the future our past deeds
 adieu till then then fail not you have won
 a wife of me though there my hope be done
bertram a heaven on earth i have won by wooing thee
 exit
diana for which live long to thank both heaven and me
 you may so in the end
 my mother told me just how he would woo
 as if she sat in s heart she says all men
 have the like oaths he had sworn to marry me
 when his wife's dead therefore i'll lie with him
 when i am buried since frenchmen are so braid
 marry that will i live and die a maid
 only in this disguise i think't no sin
 to cozen him that would unjustly win
 exit
 all's well that ends well
act iv
scene iii the florentine camp
 enter the two french lords and some two or three soldiers
first lord you have not given him his mother's letter
second lord i have delivered it an hour since there is
 something in't that stings his nature for on the
 reading it he changed almost into another man
first lord he has much worthy blame laid upon him for shaking
 off so good a wife and so sweet a lady
second lord especially he hath incurred the everlasting
 displeasure of the king who had even tuned his
 bounty to sing happiness to him i will tell you a
 thing but you shall let it dwell darkly with you
first lord when you have spoken it tis dead and i am the
 grave of it
second lord he hath perverted a young gentlewoman here in
 florence of a most chaste renown and this night he
 fleshes his will in the spoil of her honour he hath
 given her his monumental ring and thinks himself
 made in the unchaste composition
first lord now god delay our rebellion as we are ourselves
 what things are we
second lord merely our own traitors and as in the common course
 of all treasons we still see them reveal
 themselves till they attain to their abhorred ends
 so he that in this action contrives against his own
 nobility in his proper stream o'erflows himself
first lord is it not meant damnable in us to be trumpeters of
 our unlawful intents we shall not then have his
 company tonight
second lord not till after midnight for he is dieted to his hour
first lord that approaches apace i would gladly have him see
 his company anatomized that he might take a measure
 of his own judgments wherein so curiously he had
 set this counterfeit
second lord we will not meddle with him till he come for his
 presence must be the whip of the other
first lord in the mean time what hear you of these wars
second lord i hear there is an overture of peace
first lord nay i assure you a peace concluded
second lord what will count rousillon do then will he travel
 higher or return again into france
first lord i perceive by this demand you are not altogether
 of his council
second lord let it be forbid sir so should i be a great deal
 of his act
first lord sir his wife some two months since fled from his
 house her pretence is a pilgrimage to saint jaques
 le grand which holy undertaking with most austere
 sanctimony she accomplished and there residing the
 tenderness of her nature became as a prey to her
 grief in fine made a groan of her last breath and
 now she sings in heaven
second lord how is this justified
first lord the stronger part of it by her own letters which
 makes her story true even to the point of her
 death her death itself which could not be her
 office to say is come was faithfully confirmed by
 the rector of the place
second lord hath the count all this intelligence
first lord ay and the particular confirmations point from
 point so to the full arming of the verity
second lord i am heartily sorry that he'll be glad of this
first lord how mightily sometimes we make us comforts of our losses
second lord and how mightily some other times we drown our gain
 in tears the great dignity that his valour hath
 here acquired for him shall at home be encountered
 with a shame as ample
first lord the web of our life is of a mingled yarn good and
 ill together our virtues would be proud if our
 faults whipped them not and our crimes would
 despair if they were not cherished by our virtues
 enter a messenger
 how now where's your master
servant he met the duke in the street sir of whom he hath
 taken a solemn leave his lordship will next
 morning for france the duke hath offered him
 letters of commendations to the king
second lord they shall be no more than needful there if they
 were more than they can commend
first lord they cannot be too sweet for the king's tartness
 here's his lordship now
 enter bertram
 how now my lord is't not after midnight
bertram i have tonight dispatched sixteen businesses a
