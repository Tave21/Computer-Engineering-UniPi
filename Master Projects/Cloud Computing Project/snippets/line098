thus saith the lord to me make thee bonds and yokes and put them upon thy neck
and send them to the king of edom and to the king of moab and to the king of the ammonites and to the king of tyrus and to the king of zidon by the hand of the messengers which come to jerusalem unto zedekiah king of judah
and command them to say unto their masters thus saith the lord of hosts the god of israel thus shall ye say unto your masters
i have made the earth the man and the beast that are upon the ground by my great power and by my outstretched arm and have given it unto whom it seemed meet unto me
and now have i given all these lands into the hand of nebuchadnezzar the king of babylon my servant and the beasts of the field have i given him also to serve him
and all nations shall serve him and his son and his son's son until the very time of his land come and then many nations and great kings shall serve themselves of him
and it shall come to pass that the nation and kingdom which will not serve the same nebuchadnezzar the king of babylon and that will not put their neck under the yoke of the king of babylon that nation will i punish saith the lord with the sword and with the famine and with the pestilence until i have consumed them by his hand
therefore hearken not ye to your prophets nor to your diviners nor to your dreamers nor to your enchanters nor to your sorcerers which speak unto you saying ye shall not serve the king of babylon
for they prophesy a lie unto you to remove you far from your land and that i should drive you out and ye should perish
but the nations that bring their neck under the yoke of the king of babylon and serve him those will i let remain still in their own land saith the lord and they shall till it and dwell therein
i spake also to zedekiah king of judah according to all these words saying bring your necks under the yoke of the king of babylon and serve him and his people and live
why will ye die thou and thy people by the sword by the famine and by the pestilence as the lord hath spoken against the nation that will not serve the king of babylon
therefore hearken not unto the words of the prophets that speak unto you saying ye shall not serve the king of babylon for they prophesy a lie unto you
for i have not sent them saith the lord yet they prophesy a lie in my name that i might drive you out and that ye might perish ye and the prophets that prophesy unto you
also i spake to the priests and to all this people saying thus saith the lord hearken not to the words of your prophets that prophesy unto you saying behold the vessels of the lord's house shall now shortly be brought again from babylon for they prophesy a lie unto you
hearken not unto them serve the king of babylon and live wherefore should this city be laid waste
but if they be prophets and if the word of the lord be with them let them now make intercession to the lord of hosts that the vessels which are left in the house of the lord and in the house of the king of judah and at jerusalem go not to babylon
for thus saith the lord of hosts concerning the pillars and concerning the sea and concerning the bases and concerning the residue of the vessels that remain in this city
which nebuchadnezzar king of babylon took not when he carried away captive jeconiah the son of jehoiakim king of judah from jerusalem to babylon and all the nobles of judah and jerusalem
yea thus saith the lord of hosts the god of israel concerning the vessels that remain in the house of the lord and in the house of the king of judah and of jerusalem
they shall be carried to babylon and there shall they be until the day that i visit them saith the lord then will i bring them up and restore them to this place
and it came to pass the same year in the beginning of the reign of zedekiah king of judah in the fourth year and in the fifth month that hananiah the son of azur the prophet which was of gibeon spake unto me in the house of the lord in the presence of the priests and of all the people saying
thus speaketh the lord of hosts the god of israel saying i have broken the yoke of the king of babylon
within two full years will i bring again into this place all the vessels of the lord's house that nebuchadnezzar king of babylon took away from this place and carried them to babylon
and i will bring again to this place jeconiah the son of jehoiakim king of judah with all the captives of judah that went into babylon saith the lord for i will break the yoke of the king of babylon
then the prophet jeremiah said unto the prophet hananiah in the presence of the priests and in the presence of all the people that stood in the house of the lord
even the prophet jeremiah said amen the lord do so the lord perform thy words which thou hast prophesied to bring again the vessels of the lord's house and all that is carried away captive from babylon into this place
nevertheless hear thou now this word that i speak in thine ears and in the ears of all the people
the prophets that have been before me and before thee of old prophesied both against many countries and against great kingdoms of war and of evil and of pestilence
the prophet which prophesieth of peace when the word of the prophet shall come to pass then shall the prophet be known that the lord hath truly sent him
then hananiah the prophet took the yoke from off the prophet jeremiah's neck and brake it
and hananiah spake in the presence of all the people saying thus saith the lord even so will i break the yoke of nebuchadnezzar king of babylon from the neck of all nations within the space of two full years and the prophet jeremiah went his way
then the word of the lord came unto jeremiah the prophet after that hananiah the prophet had broken the yoke from off the neck of the prophet jeremiah saying
go and tell hananiah saying thus saith the lord thou hast broken the yokes of wood but thou shalt make for them yokes of iron
for thus saith the lord of hosts the god of israel i have put a yoke of iron upon the neck of all these nations that they may serve nebuchadnezzar king of babylon and they shall serve him and i have given him the beasts of the field also
then said the prophet jeremiah unto hananiah the prophet hear now hananiah the lord hath not sent thee but thou makest this people to trust in a lie
therefore thus saith the lord behold i will cast thee from off the face of the earth this year thou shalt die because thou hast taught rebellion against the lord
so hananiah the prophet died the same year in the seventh month
now these are the words of the letter that jeremiah the prophet sent from jerusalem unto the residue of the elders which were carried away captives and to the priests and to the prophets and to all the people whom nebuchadnezzar had carried away captive from jerusalem to babylon
after that jeconiah the king and the queen and the eunuchs the princes of judah and jerusalem and the carpenters and the smiths were departed from jerusalem
by the hand of elasah the son of shaphan and gemariah the son of hilkiah whom zedekiah king of judah sent unto babylon to nebuchadnezzar king of babylon saying
thus saith the lord of hosts the god of israel unto all that are carried away captives whom i have caused to be carried away from jerusalem unto babylon
build ye houses and dwell in them and plant gardens and eat the fruit of them
take ye wives and beget sons and daughters and take wives for your sons and give your daughters to husbands that they may bear sons and daughters that ye may be increased there and not diminished
and seek the peace of the city whither i have caused you to be carried away captives and pray unto the lord for it for in the peace thereof shall ye have peace
for thus saith the lord of hosts the god of israel let not your prophets and your diviners that be in the midst of you deceive you neither hearken to your dreams which ye cause to be dreamed
for they prophesy falsely unto you in my name i have not sent them saith the lord
for thus saith the lord that after seventy years be accomplished at babylon i will visit you and perform my good word toward you in causing you to return to this place
for i know the thoughts that i think toward you saith the lord thoughts of peace and not of evil to give you an expected end
then shall ye call upon me and ye shall go and pray unto me and i will hearken unto you
and ye shall seek me and find me when ye shall search for me with all your heart
and i will be found of you saith the lord and i will turn away your captivity and i will gather you from all the nations and from all the places whither i have driven you saith the lord and i will bring you again into the place whence i caused you to be carried away captive
because ye have said the lord hath raised us up prophets in babylon
know that thus saith the lord of the king that sitteth upon the throne of david and of all the people that dwelleth in this city and of your brethren that are not gone forth with you into captivity
thus saith the lord of hosts behold i will send upon them the sword the famine and the pestilence and will make them like vile figs that cannot be eaten they are so evil
and i will persecute them with the sword with the famine and with the pestilence and will deliver them to be removed to all the kingdoms of the earth to be a curse and an astonishment and an hissing and a reproach among all the nations whither i have driven them
because they have not hearkened to my words saith the lord which i sent unto them by my servants the prophets rising up early and sending them but ye would not hear saith the lord
hear ye therefore the word of the lord all ye of the captivity whom i have sent from jerusalem to babylon
thus saith the lord of hosts the god of israel of ahab the son of kolaiah and of zedekiah the son of maaseiah which prophesy a lie unto you in my name behold i will deliver them into the hand of nebuchadrezzar king of babylon and he shall slay them before your eyes
and of them shall be taken up a curse by all the captivity of judah which are in babylon saying the lord make thee like zedekiah and like ahab whom the king of babylon roasted in the fire
because they have committed villany in israel and have committed adultery with their neighbours wives and have spoken lying words in my name which i have not commanded them even i know and am a witness saith the lord
thus shalt thou also speak to shemaiah the nehelamite saying
thus speaketh the lord of hosts the god of israel saying because thou hast sent letters in thy name unto all the people that are at jerusalem and to zephaniah the son of maaseiah the priest and to all the priests saying
the lord hath made thee priest in the stead of jehoiada the priest that ye should be officers in the house of the lord for every man that is mad and maketh himself a prophet that thou shouldest put him in prison and in the stocks
now therefore why hast thou not reproved jeremiah of anathoth which maketh himself a prophet to you
for therefore he sent unto us in babylon saying this captivity is long build ye houses and dwell in them and plant gardens and eat the fruit of them
and zephaniah the priest read this letter in the ears of jeremiah the prophet
then came the word of the lord unto jeremiah saying
send to all them of the captivity saying thus saith the lord concerning shemaiah the nehelamite because that shemaiah hath prophesied unto you and i sent him not and he caused you to trust in a lie
therefore thus saith the lord behold i will punish shemaiah the nehelamite and his seed he shall not have a man to dwell among this people neither shall he behold the good that i will do for my people saith the lord because he hath taught rebellion against the lord
the word that came to jeremiah from the lord saying
thus speaketh the lord god of israel saying write thee all the words that i have spoken unto thee in a book
for lo the days come saith the lord that i will bring again the captivity of my people israel and judah saith the lord and i will cause them to return to the land that i gave to their fathers and they shall possess it
and these are the words that the lord spake concerning israel and concerning judah
for thus saith the lord we have heard a voice of trembling of fear and not of peace
ask ye now and see whether a man doth travail with child wherefore do i see every man with his hands on his loins as a woman in travail and all faces are turned into paleness
alas for that day is great so that none is like it it is even the time of jacob's trouble but he shall be saved out of it
for it shall come to pass in that day saith the lord of hosts that i will break his yoke from off thy neck and will burst thy bonds and strangers shall no more serve themselves of him
but they shall serve the lord their god and david their king whom i will raise up unto them
therefore fear thou not o my servant jacob saith the lord neither be dismayed o israel for lo i will save thee from afar and thy seed from the land of their captivity and jacob shall return and shall be in rest and be quiet and none shall make him afraid
for i am with thee saith the lord to save thee though i make a full end of all nations whither i have scattered thee yet will i not make a full end of thee but i will correct thee in measure and will not leave thee altogether unpunished
for thus saith the lord thy bruise is incurable and thy wound is grievous
there is none to plead thy cause that thou mayest be bound up thou hast no healing medicines
all thy lovers have forgotten thee they seek thee not for i have wounded thee with the wound of an enemy with the chastisement of a cruel one for the multitude of thine iniquity because thy sins were increased
why criest thou for thine affliction thy sorrow is incurable for the multitude of thine iniquity because thy sins were increased i have done these things unto thee
therefore all they that devour thee shall be devoured and all thine adversaries every one of them shall go into captivity and they that spoil thee shall be a spoil and all that prey upon thee will i give for a prey
for i will restore health unto thee and i will heal thee of thy wounds saith the lord because they called thee an outcast saying this is zion whom no man seeketh after
thus saith the lord behold i will bring again the captivity of jacob's tents and have mercy on his dwellingplaces and the city shall be builded upon her own heap and the palace shall remain after the manner thereof
and out of them shall proceed thanksgiving and the voice of them that make merry and i will multiply them and they shall not be few i will also glorify them and they shall not be small
their children also shall be as aforetime and their congregation shall be established before me and i will punish all that oppress them
and their nobles shall be of themselves and their governor shall proceed from the midst of them and i will cause him to draw near and he shall approach unto me for who is this that engaged his heart to approach unto me saith the lord
and ye shall be my people and i will be your god
behold the whirlwind of the lord goeth forth with fury a continuing whirlwind it shall fall with pain upon the head of the wicked
the fierce anger of the lord shall not return until he have done it and until he have performed the intents of his heart in the latter days ye shall consider it
at the same time saith the lord will i be the god of all the families of israel and they shall be my people
thus saith the lord the people which were left of the sword found grace in the wilderness even israel when i went to cause him to rest
the lord hath appeared of old unto me saying yea i have loved thee with an everlasting love therefore with lovingkindness have i drawn thee
again i will build thee and thou shalt be built o virgin of israel thou shalt again be adorned with thy tabrets and shalt go forth in the dances of them that make merry
thou shalt yet plant vines upon the mountains of samaria the planters shall plant and shall eat them as common things
for there shall be a day that the watchmen upon the mount ephraim shall cry arise ye and let us go up to zion unto the lord our god
for thus saith the lord sing with gladness for jacob and shout among the chief of the nations publish ye praise ye and say o lord save thy people the remnant of israel
behold i will bring them from the north country and gather them from the coasts of the earth and with them the blind and the lame the woman with child and her that travaileth with child together a great company shall return thither
they shall come with weeping and with supplications will i lead them i will cause them to walk by the rivers of waters in a straight way wherein they shall not stumble for i am a father to israel and ephraim is my firstborn
hear the word of the lord o ye nations and declare it in the isles afar off and say he that scattered israel will gather him and keep him as a shepherd doth his flock
for the lord hath redeemed jacob and ransomed him from the hand of him that was stronger than he
therefore they shall come and sing in the height of zion and shall flow together to the goodness of the lord for wheat and for wine and for oil and for the young of the flock and of the herd and their soul shall be as a watered garden and they shall not sorrow any more at all
then shall the virgin rejoice in the dance both young men and old together for i will turn their mourning into joy and will comfort them and make them rejoice from their sorrow
and i will satiate the soul of the priests with fatness and my people shall be satisfied with my goodness saith the lord
thus saith the lord a voice was heard in ramah lamentation and bitter weeping rahel weeping for her children refused to be comforted for her children because they were not
thus saith the lord refrain thy voice from weeping and thine eyes from tears for thy work shall be rewarded saith the lord and they shall come again from the land of the enemy
and there is hope in thine end saith the lord that thy children shall come again to their own border
i have surely heard ephraim bemoaning himself thus thou hast chastised me and i was chastised as a bullock unaccustomed to the yoke turn thou me and i shall be turned for thou art the lord my god
surely after that i was turned i repented and after that i was instructed i smote upon my thigh i was ashamed yea even confounded because i did bear the reproach of my youth
is ephraim my dear son is he a pleasant child for since i spake against him i do earnestly remember him still therefore my bowels are troubled for him i will surely have mercy upon him saith the lord
set thee up waymarks make thee high heaps set thine heart toward the highway even the way which thou wentest turn again o virgin of israel turn again to these thy cities
how long wilt thou go about o thou backsliding daughter for the lord hath created a new thing in the earth a woman shall compass a man
thus saith the lord of hosts the god of israel as yet they shall use this speech in the land of judah and in the cities thereof when i shall bring again their captivity the lord bless thee o habitation of justice and mountain of holiness
and there shall dwell in judah itself and in all the cities thereof together husbandmen and they that go forth with flocks
for i have satiated the weary soul and i have replenished every sorrowful soul
upon this i awaked and beheld and my sleep was sweet unto me
behold the days come saith the lord that i will sow the house of israel and the house of judah with the seed of man and with the seed of beast
and it shall come to pass that like as i have watched over them to pluck up and to break down and to throw down and to destroy and to afflict so will i watch over them to build and to plant saith the lord
in those days they shall say no more the fathers have eaten a sour grape and the children's teeth are set on edge
but every one shall die for his own iniquity every man that eateth the sour grape his teeth shall be set on edge
behold the days come saith the lord that i will make a new covenant with the house of israel and with the house of judah
not according to the covenant that i made with their fathers in the day that i took them by the hand to bring them out of the land of egypt which my covenant they brake although i was an husband unto them saith the lord
but this shall be the covenant that i will make with the house of israel after those days saith the lord i will put my law in their inward parts and write it in their hearts and will be their god and they shall be my people
and they shall teach no more every man his neighbour and every man his brother saying know the lord for they shall all know me from the least of them unto the greatest of them saith the lord for i will forgive their iniquity and i will remember their sin no more
thus saith the lord which giveth the sun for a light by day and the ordinances of the moon and of the stars for a light by night which divideth the sea when the waves thereof roar the lord of hosts is his name
if those ordinances depart from before me saith the lord then the seed of israel also shall cease from being a nation before me for ever
thus saith the lord if heaven above can be measured and the foundations of the earth searched out beneath i will also cast off all the seed of israel for all that they have done saith the lord
behold the days come saith the lord that the city shall be built to the lord from the tower of hananeel unto the gate of the corner
and the measuring line shall yet go forth over against it upon the hill gareb and shall compass about to goath
and the whole valley of the dead bodies and of the ashes and all the fields unto the brook of kidron unto the corner of the horse gate toward the east shall be holy unto the lord it shall not be plucked up nor thrown down any more for ever
the word that came to jeremiah from the lord in the tenth year of zedekiah king of judah which was the eighteenth year of nebuchadrezzar
for then the king of babylon's army besieged jerusalem and jeremiah the prophet was shut up in the court of the prison which was in the king of judah's house
for zedekiah king of judah had shut him up saying wherefore dost thou prophesy and say thus saith the lord behold i will give this city into the hand of the king of babylon and he shall take it
and zedekiah king of judah shall not escape out of the hand of the chaldeans but shall surely be delivered into the hand of the king of babylon and shall speak with him mouth to mouth and his eyes shall behold his eyes
and he shall lead zedekiah to babylon and there shall he be until i visit him saith the lord though ye fight with the chaldeans ye shall not prosper
and jeremiah said the word of the lord came unto me saying
behold hanameel the son of shallum thine uncle shall come unto thee saying buy thee my field that is in anathoth for the right of redemption is thine to buy it
so hanameel mine uncle's son came to me in the court of the prison according to the word of the lord and said unto me buy my field i pray thee that is in anathoth which is in the country of benjamin for the right of inheritance is thine and the redemption is thine buy it for thyself then i knew that this was the word of the lord
and i bought the field of hanameel my uncle's son that was in anathoth and weighed him the money even seventeen shekels of silver
and i subscribed the evidence and sealed it and took witnesses and weighed him the money in the balances
so i took the evidence of the purchase both that which was sealed according to the law and custom and that which was open
and i gave the evidence of the purchase unto baruch the son of neriah the son of maaseiah in the sight of hanameel mine uncle's son and in the presence of the witnesses that subscribed the book of the purchase before all the jews that sat in the court of the prison
and i charged baruch before them saying
thus saith the lord of hosts the god of israel take these evidences this evidence of the purchase both which is sealed and this evidence which is open and put them in an earthen vessel that they may continue many days
for thus saith the lord of hosts the god of israel houses and fields and vineyards shall be possessed again in this land
now when i had delivered the evidence of the purchase unto baruch the son of neriah i prayed unto the lord saying
ah lord god behold thou hast made the heaven and the earth by thy great power and stretched out arm and there is nothing too hard for thee
thou shewest lovingkindness unto thousands and recompensest the iniquity of the fathers into the bosom of their children after them the great the mighty god the lord of hosts is his name
great in counsel and mighty in work for thine eyes are open upon all the ways of the sons of men to give every one according to his ways and according to the fruit of his doings
which hast set signs and wonders in the land of egypt even unto this day and in israel and among other men and hast made thee a name as at this day
and hast brought forth thy people israel out of the land of egypt with signs and with wonders and with a strong hand and with a stretched out arm and with great terror
and hast given them this land which thou didst swear to their fathers to give them a land flowing with milk and honey
and they came in and possessed it but they obeyed not thy voice neither walked in thy law they have done nothing of all that thou commandedst them to do therefore thou hast caused all this evil to come upon them
behold the mounts they are come unto the city to take it and the city is given into the hand of the chaldeans that fight against it because of the sword and of the famine and of the pestilence and what thou hast spoken is come to pass and behold thou seest it
and thou hast said unto me o lord god buy thee the field for money and take witnesses for the city is given into the hand of the chaldeans
then came the word of the lord unto jeremiah saying
behold i am the lord the god of all flesh is there any thing too hard for me
therefore thus saith the lord behold i will give this city into the hand of the chaldeans and into the hand of nebuchadrezzar king of babylon and he shall take it
and the chaldeans that fight against this city shall come and set fire on this city and burn it with the houses upon whose roofs they have offered incense unto baal and poured out drink offerings unto other gods to provoke me to anger
for the children of israel and the children of judah have only done evil before me from their youth for the children of israel have only provoked me to anger with the work of their hands saith the lord
for this city hath been to me as a provocation of mine anger and of my fury from the day that they built it even unto this day that i should remove it from before my face
because of all the evil of the children of israel and of the children of judah which they have done to provoke me to anger they their kings their princes their priests and their prophets and the men of judah and the inhabitants of jerusalem
and they have turned unto me the back and not the face though i taught them rising up early and teaching them yet they have not hearkened to receive instruction
but they set their abominations in the house which is called by my name to defile it
and they built the high places of baal which are in the valley of the son of hinnom to cause their sons and their daughters to pass through the fire unto molech which i commanded them not neither came it into my mind that they should do this abomination to cause judah to sin
and now therefore thus saith the lord the god of israel concerning this city whereof ye say it shall be delivered into the hand of the king of babylon by the sword and by the famine and by the pestilence
behold i will gather them out of all countries whither i have driven them in mine anger and in my fury and in great wrath and i will bring them again unto this place and i will cause them to dwell safely
and they shall be my people and i will be their god
and i will give them one heart and one way that they may fear me for ever for the good of them and of their children after them
and i will make an everlasting covenant with them that i will not turn away from them to do them good but i will put my fear in their hearts that they shall not depart from me
yea i will rejoice over them to do them good and i will plant them in this land assuredly with my whole heart and with my whole soul
for thus saith the lord like as i have brought all this great evil upon this people so will i bring upon them all the good that i have promised them
and fields shall be bought in this land whereof ye say it is desolate without man or beast it is given into the hand of the chaldeans
men shall buy fields for money and subscribe evidences and seal them and take witnesses in the land of benjamin and in the places about jerusalem and in the cities of judah and in the cities of the mountains and in the cities of the valley and in the cities of the south for i will cause their captivity to return saith the lord
moreover the word of the lord came unto jeremiah the second time while he was yet shut up in the court of the prison saying
thus saith the lord the maker thereof the lord that formed it to establish it the lord is his name
call unto me and i will answer thee and shew thee great and mighty things which thou knowest not
for thus saith the lord the god of israel concerning the houses of this city and concerning the houses of the kings of judah which are thrown down by the mounts and by the sword
they come to fight with the chaldeans but it is to fill them with the dead bodies of men whom i have slain in mine anger and in my fury and for all whose wickedness i have hid my face from this city
behold i will bring it health and cure and i will cure them and will reveal unto them the abundance of peace and truth
and i will cause the captivity of judah and the captivity of israel to return and will build them as at the first
and i will cleanse them from all their iniquity whereby they have sinned against me and i will pardon all their iniquities whereby they have sinned and whereby they have transgressed against me
and it shall be to me a name of joy a praise and an honour before all the nations of the earth which shall hear all the good that i do unto them and they shall fear and tremble for all the goodness and for all the prosperity that i procure unto it
thus saith the lord again there shall be heard in this place which ye say shall be desolate without man and without beast even in the cities of judah and in the streets of jerusalem that are desolate without man and without inhabitant and without beast
the voice of joy and the voice of gladness the voice of the bridegroom and the voice of the bride the voice of them that shall say praise the lord of hosts for the lord is good for his mercy endureth for ever and of them that shall bring the sacrifice of praise into the house of the lord for i will cause to return the captivity of the land as at the first saith the lord
thus saith the lord of hosts again in this place which is desolate without man and without beast and in all the cities thereof shall be an habitation of shepherds causing their flocks to lie down
in the cities of the mountains in the cities of the vale and in the cities of the south and in the land of benjamin and in the places about jerusalem and in the cities of judah shall the flocks pass again under the hands of him that telleth them saith the lord
behold the days come saith the lord that i will perform that good thing which i have promised unto the house of israel and to the house of judah
in those days and at that time will i cause the branch of righteousness to grow up unto david and he shall execute judgment and righteousness in the land
in those days shall judah be saved and jerusalem shall dwell safely and this is the name wherewith she shall be called the lord our righteousness
for thus saith the lord david shall never want a man to sit upon the throne of the house of israel
neither shall the priests the levites want a man before me to offer burnt offerings and to kindle meat offerings and to do sacrifice continually
and the word of the lord came unto jeremiah saying
thus saith the lord if ye can break my covenant of the day and my covenant of the night and that there should not be day and night in their season
then may also my covenant be broken with david my servant that he should not have a son to reign upon his throne and with the levites the priests my ministers
as the host of heaven cannot be numbered neither the sand of the sea measured so will i multiply the seed of david my servant and the levites that minister unto me
