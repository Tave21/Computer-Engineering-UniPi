 die a bachelor i did not think i should live till i
 were married here comes beatrice by this day
 she's a fair lady i do spy some marks of love in
 her
 enter beatrice
beatrice against my will i am sent to bid you come in to dinner
benedick fair beatrice i thank you for your pains
beatrice i took no more pains for those thanks than you take
 pains to thank me if it had been painful i would
 not have come
benedick you take pleasure then in the message
beatrice yea just so much as you may take upon a knife's
 point and choke a daw withal you have no stomach
 signior fare you well
 exit
benedick ha against my will i am sent to bid you come in
 to dinner there's a double meaning in that i took
 no more pains for those thanks than you took pains
 to thank me that's as much as to say any pains
 that i take for you is as easy as thanks if i do
 not take pity of her i am a villain if i do not
 love her i am a jew i will go get her picture
 exit
 much ado about nothing
act iii
scene i leonato's garden
 enter hero margaret and ursula
hero good margaret run thee to the parlor
 there shalt thou find my cousin beatrice
 proposing with the prince and claudio
 whisper her ear and tell her i and ursula
 walk in the orchard and our whole discourse
 is all of her say that thou overheard'st us
 and bid her steal into the pleached bower
 where honeysuckles ripen'd by the sun
 forbid the sun to enter like favourites
 made proud by princes that advance their pride
 against that power that bred it there will she hide her
 to listen our purpose this is thy office
 bear thee well in it and leave us alone
margaret i'll make her come i warrant you presently
 exit
hero now ursula when beatrice doth come
 as we do trace this alley up and down
 our talk must only be of benedick
 when i do name him let it be thy part
 to praise him more than ever man did merit
 my talk to thee must be how benedick
 is sick in love with beatrice of this matter
 is little cupid's crafty arrow made
 that only wounds by hearsay
 enter beatrice behind
 now begin
 for look where beatrice like a lapwing runs
 close by the ground to hear our conference
ursula the pleasant'st angling is to see the fish
 cut with her golden oars the silver stream
 and greedily devour the treacherous bait
 so angle we for beatrice who even now
 is couched in the woodbine coverture
 fear you not my part of the dialogue
hero then go we near her that her ear lose nothing
 of the false sweet bait that we lay for it
 approaching the bower
 no truly ursula she is too disdainful
 i know her spirits are as coy and wild
 as haggerds of the rock
ursula but are you sure
 that benedick loves beatrice so entirely
hero so says the prince and my newtrothed lord
ursula and did they bid you tell her of it madam
hero they did entreat me to acquaint her of it
 but i persuaded them if they loved benedick
 to wish him wrestle with affection
 and never to let beatrice know of it
ursula why did you so doth not the gentleman
 deserve as full as fortunate a bed
 as ever beatrice shall couch upon
hero o god of love i know he doth deserve
 as much as may be yielded to a man
 but nature never framed a woman's heart
 of prouder stuff than that of beatrice
 disdain and scorn ride sparkling in her eyes
 misprising what they look on and her wit
 values itself so highly that to her
 all matter else seems weak she cannot love
 nor take no shape nor project of affection
 she is so selfendeared
ursula sure i think so
 and therefore certainly it were not good
 she knew his love lest she make sport at it
hero why you speak truth i never yet saw man
 how wise how noble young how rarely featured
 but she would spell him backward if fairfaced
 she would swear the gentleman should be her sister
 if black why nature drawing of an antique
 made a foul blot if tall a lance illheaded
 if low an agate very vilely cut
 if speaking why a vane blown with all winds
 if silent why a block moved with none
 so turns she every man the wrong side out
 and never gives to truth and virtue that
 which simpleness and merit purchaseth
ursula sure sure such carping is not commendable
hero no not to be so odd and from all fashions
 as beatrice is cannot be commendable
 but who dare tell her so if i should speak
 she would mock me into air o she would laugh me
 out of myself press me to death with wit
 therefore let benedick like cover'd fire
 consume away in sighs waste inwardly
 it were a better death than die with mocks
 which is as bad as die with tickling
ursula yet tell her of it hear what she will say
hero no rather i will go to benedick
 and counsel him to fight against his passion
 and truly i'll devise some honest slanders
 to stain my cousin with one doth not know
 how much an ill word may empoison liking
ursula o do not do your cousin such a wrong
 she cannot be so much without true judgment
 having so swift and excellent a wit
 as she is prized to haveas to refuse
 so rare a gentleman as signior benedick
hero he is the only man of italy
 always excepted my dear claudio
ursula i pray you be not angry with me madam
 speaking my fancy signior benedick
 for shape for bearing argument and valour
 goes foremost in report through italy
hero indeed he hath an excellent good name
ursula his excellence did earn it ere he had it
 when are you married madam
hero why every day tomorrow come go in
 i'll show thee some attires and have thy counsel
 which is the best to furnish me tomorrow
ursula she's limed i warrant you we have caught her madam
hero if it proves so then loving goes by haps
 some cupid kills with arrows some with traps
 exeunt hero and ursula
beatrice coming forward
 what fire is in mine ears can this be true
 stand i condemn'd for pride and scorn so much
 contempt farewell and maiden pride adieu
 no glory lives behind the back of such
 and benedick love on i will requite thee
 taming my wild heart to thy loving hand
 if thou dost love my kindness shall incite thee
 to bind our loves up in a holy band
 for others say thou dost deserve and i
 believe it better than reportingly
 exit
 much ado about nothing
act iii
scene ii a room in leonato's house
 enter don pedro claudio benedick and leonato
don pedro i do but stay till your marriage be consummate and
 then go i toward arragon
claudio i'll bring you thither my lord if you'll
 vouchsafe me
don pedro nay that would be as great a soil in the new gloss
 of your marriage as to show a child his new coat
 and forbid him to wear it i will only be bold
 with benedick for his company for from the crown
 of his head to the sole of his foot he is all
 mirth he hath twice or thrice cut cupid's
 bowstring and the little hangman dare not shoot at
 him he hath a heart as sound as a bell and his
 tongue is the clapper for what his heart thinks his
 tongue speaks
benedick gallants i am not as i have been
leonato so say i methinks you are sadder
claudio i hope he be in love
don pedro hang him truant there's no true drop of blood in
 him to be truly touched with love if he be sad
 he wants money
benedick i have the toothache
don pedro draw it
benedick hang it
claudio you must hang it first and draw it afterwards
don pedro what sigh for the toothache
leonato where is but a humour or a worm
benedick well every one can master a grief but he that has
 it
claudio yet say i he is in love
don pedro there is no appearance of fancy in him unless it be
 a fancy that he hath to strange disguises as to be
 a dutchman today a frenchman tomorrow or in the
 shape of two countries at once as a german from
 the waist downward all slops and a spaniard from
 the hip upward no doublet unless he have a fancy
 to this foolery as it appears he hath he is no
 fool for fancy as you would have it appear he is
claudio if he be not in love with some woman there is no
 believing old signs a brushes his hat o'
 mornings what should that bode
don pedro hath any man seen him at the barber's
claudio no but the barber's man hath been seen with him
 and the old ornament of his cheek hath already
 stuffed tennisballs
