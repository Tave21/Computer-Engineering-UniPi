in the beginning god created the heaven and the earth
and the earth was without form and void and darkness was upon the face of the deep and the spirit of god moved upon the face of the waters
and god said let there be light and there was light
and god saw the light that it was good and god divided the light from the darkness
and god called the light day and the darkness he called night and the evening and the morning were the first day
and god said let there be a firmament in the midst of the waters and let it divide the waters from the waters
and god made the firmament and divided the waters which were under the firmament from the waters which were above the firmament and it was so
and god called the firmament heaven and the evening and the morning were the second day
and god said let the waters under the heaven be gathered together unto one place and let the dry land appear and it was so
and god called the dry land earth and the gathering together of the waters called he seas and god saw that it was good
and god said let the earth bring forth grass the herb yielding seed and the fruit tree yielding fruit after his kind whose seed is in itself upon the earth and it was so
and the earth brought forth grass and herb yielding seed after his kind and the tree yielding fruit whose seed was in itself after his kind and god saw that it was good
and the evening and the morning were the third day
and god said let there be lights in the firmament of the heaven to divide the day from the night and let them be for signs and for seasons and for days and years
and let them be for lights in the firmament of the heaven to give light upon the earth and it was so
and god made two great lights the greater light to rule the day and the lesser light to rule the night he made the stars also
and god set them in the firmament of the heaven to give light upon the earth
and to rule over the day and over the night and to divide the light from the darkness and god saw that it was good
and the evening and the morning were the fourth day
and god said let the waters bring forth abundantly the moving creature that hath life and fowl that may fly above the earth in the open firmament of heaven
and god created great whales and every living creature that moveth which the waters brought forth abundantly after their kind and every winged fowl after his kind and god saw that it was good
and god blessed them saying be fruitful and multiply and fill the waters in the seas and let fowl multiply in the earth
and the evening and the morning were the fifth day
and god said let the earth bring forth the living creature after his kind cattle and creeping thing and beast of the earth after his kind and it was so
and god made the beast of the earth after his kind and cattle after their kind and every thing that creepeth upon the earth after his kind and god saw that it was good
and god said let us make man in our image after our likeness and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the fowl of the air and over the cattle and over all the earth and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth
so god created man in his own image in the image of god created he him male and female created he them
and god blessed them and god said unto them be fruitful and multiply and replenish the earth and subdue it and have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the fowl of the air and over every living thing that moveth upon the earth
and god said behold i have given you every herb bearing seed which is upon the face of all the earth and every tree in the which is the fruit of a tree yielding seed to you it shall be for meat
and to every beast of the earth and to every fowl of the air and to every thing that creepeth upon the earth wherein there is life i have given every green herb for meat and it was so
and god saw every thing that he had made and behold it was very good and the evening and the morning were the sixth day
thus the heavens and the earth were finished and all the host of them
and on the seventh day god ended his work which he had made and he rested on the seventh day from all his work which he had made
and god blessed the seventh day and sanctified it because that in it he had rested from all his work which god created and made
these are the generations of the heavens and of the earth when they were created in the day that the lord god made the earth and the heavens
and every plant of the field before it was in the earth and every herb of the field before it grew for the lord god had not caused it to rain upon the earth and there was not a man to till the ground
but there went up a mist from the earth and watered the whole face of the ground
and the lord god formed man of the dust of the ground and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life and man became a living soul
and the lord god planted a garden eastward in eden and there he put the man whom he had formed
and out of the ground made the lord god to grow every tree that is pleasant to the sight and good for food the tree of life also in the midst of the garden and the tree of knowledge of good and evil
and a river went out of eden to water the garden and from thence it was parted and became into four heads
the name of the first is pison that is it which compasseth the whole land of havilah where there is gold
and the gold of that land is good there is bdellium and the onyx stone
and the name of the second river is gihon the same is it that compasseth the whole land of ethiopia
and the name of the third river is hiddekel that is it which goeth toward the east of assyria and the fourth river is euphrates
and the lord god took the man and put him into the garden of eden to dress it and to keep it
and the lord god commanded the man saying of every tree of the garden thou mayest freely eat
but of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil thou shalt not eat of it for in the day that thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely die
and the lord god said it is not good that the man should be alone i will make him an help meet for him
and out of the ground the lord god formed every beast of the field and every fowl of the air and brought them unto adam to see what he would call them and whatsoever adam called every living creature that was the name thereof
and adam gave names to all cattle and to the fowl of the air and to every beast of the field but for adam there was not found an help meet for him
and the lord god caused a deep sleep to fall upon adam and he slept and he took one of his ribs and closed up the flesh instead thereof
and the rib which the lord god had taken from man made he a woman and brought her unto the man
and adam said this is now bone of my bones and flesh of my flesh she shall be called woman because she was taken out of man
therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother and shall cleave unto his wife and they shall be one flesh
and they were both naked the man and his wife and were not ashamed
now the serpent was more subtil than any beast of the field which the lord god had made and he said unto the woman yea hath god said ye shall not eat of every tree of the garden
and the woman said unto the serpent we may eat of the fruit of the trees of the garden
but of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden god hath said ye shall not eat of it neither shall ye touch it lest ye die
and the serpent said unto the woman ye shall not surely die
for god doth know that in the day ye eat thereof then your eyes shall be opened and ye shall be as gods knowing good and evil
and when the woman saw that the tree was good for food and that it was pleasant to the eyes and a tree to be desired to make one wise she took of the fruit thereof and did eat and gave also unto her husband with her and he did eat
and the eyes of them both were opened and they knew that they were naked and they sewed fig leaves together and made themselves aprons
and they heard the voice of the lord god walking in the garden in the cool of the day and adam and his wife hid themselves from the presence of the lord god amongst the trees of the garden
and the lord god called unto adam and said unto him where art thou
and he said i heard thy voice in the garden and i was afraid because i was naked and i hid myself
and he said who told thee that thou wast naked hast thou eaten of the tree whereof i commanded thee that thou shouldest not eat
and the man said the woman whom thou gavest to be with me she gave me of the tree and i did eat
and the lord god said unto the woman what is this that thou hast done and the woman said the serpent beguiled me and i did eat
and the lord god said unto the serpent because thou hast done this thou art cursed above all cattle and above every beast of the field upon thy belly shalt thou go and dust shalt thou eat all the days of thy life
and i will put enmity between thee and the woman and between thy seed and her seed it shall bruise thy head and thou shalt bruise his heel
unto the woman he said i will greatly multiply thy sorrow and thy conception in sorrow thou shalt bring forth children and thy desire shall be to thy husband and he shall rule over thee
and unto adam he said because thou hast hearkened unto the voice of thy wife and hast eaten of the tree of which i commanded thee saying thou shalt not eat of it cursed is the ground for thy sake in sorrow shalt thou eat of it all the days of thy life
thorns also and thistles shall it bring forth to thee and thou shalt eat the herb of the field
in the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread till thou return unto the ground for out of it wast thou taken for dust thou art and unto dust shalt thou return
and adam called his wife's name eve because she was the mother of all living
unto adam also and to his wife did the lord god make coats of skins and clothed them
and the lord god said behold the man is become as one of us to know good and evil and now lest he put forth his hand and take also of the tree of life and eat and live for ever
therefore the lord god sent him forth from the garden of eden to till the ground from whence he was taken
so he drove out the man and he placed at the east of the garden of eden cherubims and a flaming sword which turned every way to keep the way of the tree of life
and adam knew eve his wife and she conceived and bare cain and said i have gotten a man from the lord
and she again bare his brother abel and abel was a keeper of sheep but cain was a tiller of the ground
and in process of time it came to pass that cain brought of the fruit of the ground an offering unto the lord
and abel he also brought of the firstlings of his flock and of the fat thereof and the lord had respect unto abel and to his offering
but unto cain and to his offering he had not respect and cain was very wroth and his countenance fell
and the lord said unto cain why art thou wroth and why is thy countenance fallen
if thou doest well shalt thou not be accepted and if thou doest not well sin lieth at the door and unto thee shall be his desire and thou shalt rule over him
and cain talked with abel his brother and it came to pass when they were in the field that cain rose up against abel his brother and slew him
and the lord said unto cain where is abel thy brother and he said i know not am i my brother's keeper
and he said what hast thou done the voice of thy brother's blood crieth unto me from the ground
and now art thou cursed from the earth which hath opened her mouth to receive thy brother's blood from thy hand
when thou tillest the ground it shall not henceforth yield unto thee her strength a fugitive and a vagabond shalt thou be in the earth
and cain said unto the lord my punishment is greater than i can bear
behold thou hast driven me out this day from the face of the earth and from thy face shall i be hid and i shall be a fugitive and a vagabond in the earth and it shall come to pass that every one that findeth me shall slay me
and the lord said unto him therefore whosoever slayeth cain vengeance shall be taken on him sevenfold and the lord set a mark upon cain lest any finding him should kill him
and cain went out from the presence of the lord and dwelt in the land of nod on the east of eden
and cain knew his wife and she conceived and bare enoch and he builded a city and called the name of the city after the name of his son enoch
and unto enoch was born irad and irad begat mehujael and mehujael begat methusael and methusael begat lamech
and lamech took unto him two wives the name of the one was adah and the name of the other zillah
and adah bare jabal he was the father of such as dwell in tents and of such as have cattle
and his brother's name was jubal he was the father of all such as handle the harp and organ
and zillah she also bare tubalcain an instructer of every artificer in brass and iron and the sister of tubalcain was naamah
and lamech said unto his wives adah and zillah hear my voice ye wives of lamech hearken unto my speech for i have slain a man to my wounding and a young man to my hurt
if cain shall be avenged sevenfold truly lamech seventy and sevenfold
and adam knew his wife again and she bare a son and called his name seth for god said she hath appointed me another seed instead of abel whom cain slew
and to seth to him also there was born a son and he called his name enos then began men to call upon the name of the lord
this is the book of the generations of adam in the day that god created man in the likeness of god made he him
male and female created he them and blessed them and called their name adam in the day when they were created
and adam lived an hundred and thirty years and begat a son in his own likeness after his image and called his name seth
and the days of adam after he had begotten seth were eight hundred years and he begat sons and daughters
and all the days that adam lived were nine hundred and thirty years and he died
and seth lived an hundred and five years and begat enos
and seth lived after he begat enos eight hundred and seven years and begat sons and daughters
and all the days of seth were nine hundred and twelve years and he died
and enos lived ninety years and begat cainan
and enos lived after he begat cainan eight hundred and fifteen years and begat sons and daughters
and all the days of enos were nine hundred and five years and he died
and cainan lived seventy years and begat mahalaleel
and cainan lived after he begat mahalaleel eight hundred and forty years and begat sons and daughters
and all the days of cainan were nine hundred and ten years and he died
and mahalaleel lived sixty and five years and begat jared
and mahalaleel lived after he begat jared eight hundred and thirty years and begat sons and daughters
and all the days of mahalaleel were eight hundred ninety and five years and he died
and jared lived an hundred sixty and two years and he begat enoch
and jared lived after he begat enoch eight hundred years and begat sons and daughters
and all the days of jared were nine hundred sixty and two years and he died
and enoch lived sixty and five years and begat methuselah
and enoch walked with god after he begat methuselah three hundred years and begat sons and daughters
and all the days of enoch were three hundred sixty and five years
and enoch walked with god and he was not for god took him
and methuselah lived an hundred eighty and seven years and begat lamech
and methuselah lived after he begat lamech seven hundred eighty and two years and begat sons and daughters
and all the days of methuselah were nine hundred sixty and nine years and he died
and lamech lived an hundred eighty and two years and begat a son
and he called his name noah saying this same shall comfort us concerning our work and toil of our hands because of the ground which the lord hath cursed
and lamech lived after he begat noah five hundred ninety and five years and begat sons and daughters
and all the days of lamech were seven hundred seventy and seven years and he died
and noah was five hundred years old and noah begat shem ham and japheth
and it came to pass when men began to multiply on the face of the earth and daughters were born unto them
that the sons of god saw the daughters of men that they were fair and they took them wives of all which they chose
and the lord said my spirit shall not always strive with man for that he also is flesh yet his days shall be an hundred and twenty years
there were giants in the earth in those days and also after that when the sons of god came in unto the daughters of men and they bare children to them the same became mighty men which were of old men of renown
and god saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth and that every imagination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually
and it repented the lord that he had made man on the earth and it grieved him at his heart
and the lord said i will destroy man whom i have created from the face of the earth both man and beast and the creeping thing and the fowls of the air for it repenteth me that i have made them
but noah found grace in the eyes of the lord
these are the generations of noah noah was a just man and perfect in his generations and noah walked with god
and noah begat three sons shem ham and japheth
the earth also was corrupt before god and the earth was filled with violence
and god looked upon the earth and behold it was corrupt for all flesh had corrupted his way upon the earth
and god said unto noah the end of all flesh is come before me for the earth is filled with violence through them and behold i will destroy them with the earth
make thee an ark of gopher wood rooms shalt thou make in the ark and shalt pitch it within and without with pitch
and this is the fashion which thou shalt make it of the length of the ark shall be three hundred cubits the breadth of it fifty cubits and the height of it thirty cubits
a window shalt thou make to the ark and in a cubit shalt thou finish it above and the door of the ark shalt thou set in the side thereof with lower second and third stories shalt thou make it
and behold i even i do bring a flood of waters upon the earth to destroy all flesh wherein is the breath of life from under heaven and every thing that is in the earth shall die
but with thee will i establish my covenant and thou shalt come into the ark thou and thy sons and thy wife and thy sons wives with thee
and of every living thing of all flesh two of every sort shalt thou bring into the ark to keep them alive with thee they shall be male and female
of fowls after their kind and of cattle after their kind of every creeping thing of the earth after his kind two of every sort shall come unto thee to keep them alive
and take thou unto thee of all food that is eaten and thou shalt gather it to thee and it shall be for food for thee and for them
thus did noah according to all that god commanded him so did he
and the lord said unto noah come thou and all thy house into the ark for thee have i seen righteous before me in this generation
of every clean beast thou shalt take to thee by sevens the male and his female and of beasts that are not clean by two the male and his female
of fowls also of the air by sevens the male and the female to keep seed alive upon the face of all the earth
for yet seven days and i will cause it to rain upon the earth forty days and forty nights and every living substance that i have made will i destroy from off the face of the earth
and noah did according unto all that the lord commanded him
and noah was six hundred years old when the flood of waters was upon the earth
and noah went in and his sons and his wife and his sons wives with him into the ark because of the waters of the flood
of clean beasts and of beasts that are not clean and of fowls and of every thing that creepeth upon the earth
there went in two and two unto noah into the ark the male and the female as god had commanded noah
and it came to pass after seven days that the waters of the flood were upon the earth
in the six hundredth year of noah's life in the second month the seventeenth day of the month the same day were all the fountains of the great deep broken up and the windows of heaven were opened
and the rain was upon the earth forty days and forty nights
in the selfsame day entered noah and shem and ham and japheth the sons of noah and noah's wife and the three wives of his sons with them into the ark
they and every beast after his kind and all the cattle after their kind and every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth after his kind and every fowl after his kind every bird of every sort
and they went in unto noah into the ark two and two of all flesh wherein is the breath of life
and they that went in went in male and female of all flesh as god had commanded him and the lord shut him in
and the flood was forty days upon the earth and the waters increased and bare up the ark and it was lift up above the earth
and the waters prevailed and were increased greatly upon the earth and the ark went upon the face of the waters
and the waters prevailed exceedingly upon the earth and all the high hills that were under the whole heaven were covered
fifteen cubits upward did the waters prevail and the mountains were covered
and all flesh died that moved upon the earth both of fowl and of cattle and of beast and of every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth and every man
all in whose nostrils was the breath of life of all that was in the dry land died
and every living substance was destroyed which was upon the face of the ground both man and cattle and the creeping things and the fowl of the heaven and they were destroyed from the earth and noah only remained alive and they that were with him in the ark
and the waters prevailed upon the earth an hundred and fifty days
and god remembered noah and every living thing and all the cattle that was with him in the ark and god made a wind to pass over the earth and the waters asswaged
the fountains also of the deep and the windows of heaven were stopped and the rain from heaven was restrained
and the waters returned from off the earth continually and after the end of the hundred and fifty days the waters were abated
and the ark rested in the seventh month on the seventeenth day of the month upon the mountains of ararat
and the waters decreased continually until the tenth month in the tenth month on the first day of the month were the tops of the mountains seen
and it came to pass at the end of forty days that noah opened the window of the ark which he had made
and he sent forth a raven which went forth to and fro until the waters were dried up from off the earth
also he sent forth a dove from him to see if the waters were abated from off the face of the ground
but the dove found no rest for the sole of her foot and she returned unto him into the ark for the waters were on the face of the whole earth then he put forth his hand and took her and pulled her in unto him into the ark
and he stayed yet other seven days and again he sent forth the dove out of the ark
and the dove came in to him in the evening and lo in her mouth was an olive leaf pluckt off so noah knew that the waters were abated from off the earth
and he stayed yet other seven days and sent forth the dove which returned not again unto him any more
and it came to pass in the six hundredth and first year in the first month the first day of the month the waters were dried up from off the earth and noah removed the covering of the ark and looked and behold the face of the ground was dry
and in the second month on the seven and twentieth day of the month was the earth dried
