 woo'd me to steal it but she so loves the token
 for he conjured her she should ever keep it
 that she reserves it evermore about her
 to kiss and talk to i'll have the work ta'en out
 and give't iago what he will do with it
 heaven knows not i
 i nothing but to please his fantasy
 reenter iago
iago how now what do you here alone
emilia do not you chide i have a thing for you
iago a thing for me it is a common thing
emilia ha
iago to have a foolish wife
emilia o is that all what will you give me now
 for the same handkerchief
iago what handkerchief
emilia what handkerchief
 why that the moor first gave to desdemona
 that which so often you did bid me steal
iago hast stol'n it from her
emilia no faith she let it drop by negligence
 and to the advantage i being here took't up
 look here it is
iago a good wench give it me
emilia what will you do with t that you have been
 so earnest
 to have me filch it
iago snatching it why what's that to you
emilia if it be not for some purpose of import
 give't me again poor lady she'll run mad
 when she shall lack it
iago be not acknown on t i have use for it
 go leave me
 exit emilia
 i will in cassio's lodging lose this napkin
 and let him find it trifles light as air
 are to the jealous confirmations strong
 as proofs of holy writ this may do something
 the moor already changes with my poison
 dangerous conceits are in their natures poisons
 which at the first are scarce found to distaste
 but with a little act upon the blood
 burn like the mines of sulphur i did say so
 look where he comes
 reenter othello
 not poppy nor mandragora
 nor all the drowsy syrups of the world
 shall ever medicine thee to that sweet sleep
 which thou owedst yesterday
othello ha ha false to me
iago why how now general no more of that
othello avaunt be gone thou hast set me on the rack
 i swear tis better to be much abused
 than but to know't a little
iago how now my lord
othello what sense had i of her stol'n hours of lust
 i saw't not thought it not it harm'd not me
 i slept the next night well was free and merry
 i found not cassio's kisses on her lips
 he that is robb'd not wanting what is stol'n
 let him not know't and he's not robb'd at all
iago i am sorry to hear this
othello i had been happy if the general camp
 pioners and all had tasted her sweet body
 so i had nothing known o now for ever
 farewell the tranquil mind farewell content
 farewell the plumed troop and the big wars
 that make ambition virtue o farewell
 farewell the neighing steed and the shrill trump
 the spiritstirring drum the earpiercing fife
 the royal banner and all quality
 pride pomp and circumstance of glorious war
 and o you mortal engines whose rude throats
 the immortal jove's dead clamours counterfeit
 farewell othello's occupation's gone
iago is't possible my lord
othello villain be sure thou prove my love a whore
 be sure of it give me the ocular proof
 or by the worth of man's eternal soul
 thou hadst been better have been born a dog
 than answer my waked wrath
iago is't come to this
othello make me to see't or at the least so prove it
 that the probation bear no hinge nor loop
 to hang a doubt on or woe upon thy life
iago my noble lord
othello if thou dost slander her and torture me
 never pray more abandon all remorse
 on horror's head horrors accumulate
 do deeds to make heaven weep all earth amazed
 for nothing canst thou to damnation add
 greater than that
iago o grace o heaven forgive me
 are you a man have you a soul or sense
 god be wi you take mine office o wretched fool
 that livest to make thine honesty a vice
 o monstrous world take note take note o world
 to be direct and honest is not safe
 i thank you for this profit and from hence
 i'll love no friend sith love breeds such offence
othello nay stay thou shouldst be honest
iago i should be wise for honesty's a fool
 and loses that it works for
othello by the world
 i think my wife be honest and think she is not
 i think that thou art just and think thou art not
 i'll have some proof her name that was as fresh
 as dian's visage is now begrimed and black
 as mine own face if there be cords or knives
 poison or fire or suffocating streams
 i'll not endure it would i were satisfied
iago i see sir you are eaten up with passion
 i do repent me that i put it to you
 you would be satisfied
othello would nay i will
iago and may but how how satisfied my lord
 would you the supervisor grossly gape on
 behold her topp'd
othello death and damnation o
iago it were a tedious difficulty i think
 to bring them to that prospect damn them then
 if ever mortal eyes do see them bolster
 more than their own what then how then
 what shall i say where's satisfaction
 it is impossible you should see this
 were they as prime as goats as hot as monkeys
 as salt as wolves in pride and fools as gross
 as ignorance made drunk but yet i say
 if imputation and strong circumstances
 which lead directly to the door of truth
 will give you satisfaction you may have't
othello give me a living reason she's disloyal
iago i do not like the office
 but sith i am enter'd in this cause so far
 prick'd to't by foolish honesty and love
 i will go on i lay with cassio lately
 and being troubled with a raging tooth
 i could not sleep
 there are a kind of men so loose of soul
 that in their sleeps will mutter their affairs
 one of this kind is cassio
 in sleep i heard him say sweet desdemona
 let us be wary let us hide our loves'
 and then sir would he gripe and wring my hand
 cry o sweet creature and then kiss me hard
 as if he pluck'd up kisses by the roots
 that grew upon my lips then laid his leg
 over my thigh and sigh'd and kiss'd and then
 cried cursed fate that gave thee to the moor'
othello o monstrous monstrous
iago nay this was but his dream
othello but this denoted a foregone conclusion
 tis a shrewd doubt though it be but a dream
iago and this may help to thicken other proofs
 that do demonstrate thinly
othello i'll tear her all to pieces
iago nay but be wise yet we see nothing done
 she may be honest yet tell me but this
 have you not sometimes seen a handkerchief
 spotted with strawberries in your wife's hand
othello i gave her such a one twas my first gift
iago i know not that but such a handkerchief
 i am sure it was your wife'sdid i today
 see cassio wipe his beard with
othello if it be that
iago if it be that or any that was hers
 it speaks against her with the other proofs
othello o that the slave had forty thousand lives
 one is too poor too weak for my revenge
 now do i see tis true look here iago
 all my fond love thus do i blow to heaven
 tis gone
 arise black vengeance from thy hollow cell
 yield up o love thy crown and hearted throne
 to tyrannous hate swell bosom with thy fraught
 for tis of aspics tongues
iago yet be content
othello o blood blood blood
iago patience i say your mind perhaps may change
othello never iago like to the pontic sea
 whose icy current and compulsive course
 ne'er feels retiring ebb but keeps due on
 to the propontic and the hellespont
 even so my bloody thoughts with violent pace
 shall ne'er look back ne'er ebb to humble love
 till that a capable and wide revenge
 swallow them up now by yond marble heaven
 kneels
 in the due reverence of a sacred vow
 i here engage my words
iago do not rise yet
 kneels
 witness you everburning lights above
 you elements that clip us round about
 witness that here iago doth give up
 the execution of his wit hands heart
 to wrong'd othello's service let him command
 and to obey shall be in me remorse
 what bloody business ever
 they rise
