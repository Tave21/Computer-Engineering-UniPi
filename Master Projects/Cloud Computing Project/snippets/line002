and when abram was ninety years old and nine the lord appeared to abram and said unto him i am the almighty god walk before me and be thou perfect
and i will make my covenant between me and thee and will multiply thee exceedingly
and abram fell on his face and god talked with him saying
as for me behold my covenant is with thee and thou shalt be a father of many nations
neither shall thy name any more be called abram but thy name shall be abraham for a father of many nations have i made thee
and i will make thee exceeding fruitful and i will make nations of thee and kings shall come out of thee
and i will establish my covenant between me and thee and thy seed after thee in their generations for an everlasting covenant to be a god unto thee and to thy seed after thee
and i will give unto thee and to thy seed after thee the land wherein thou art a stranger all the land of canaan for an everlasting possession and i will be their god
and god said unto abraham thou shalt keep my covenant therefore thou and thy seed after thee in their generations
this is my covenant which ye shall keep between me and you and thy seed after thee every man child among you shall be circumcised
and ye shall circumcise the flesh of your foreskin and it shall be a token of the covenant betwixt me and you
and he that is eight days old shall be circumcised among you every man child in your generations he that is born in the house or bought with money of any stranger which is not of thy seed
he that is born in thy house and he that is bought with thy money must needs be circumcised and my covenant shall be in your flesh for an everlasting covenant
and the uncircumcised man child whose flesh of his foreskin is not circumcised that soul shall be cut off from his people he hath broken my covenant
and god said unto abraham as for sarai thy wife thou shalt not call her name sarai but sarah shall her name be
and i will bless her and give thee a son also of her yea i will bless her and she shall be a mother of nations kings of people shall be of her
then abraham fell upon his face and laughed and said in his heart shall a child be born unto him that is an hundred years old and shall sarah that is ninety years old bear
and abraham said unto god o that ishmael might live before thee
and god said sarah thy wife shall bear thee a son indeed and thou shalt call his name isaac and i will establish my covenant with him for an everlasting covenant and with his seed after him
and as for ishmael i have heard thee behold i have blessed him and will make him fruitful and will multiply him exceedingly twelve princes shall he beget and i will make him a great nation
but my covenant will i establish with isaac which sarah shall bear unto thee at this set time in the next year
and he left off talking with him and god went up from abraham
and abraham took ishmael his son and all that were born in his house and all that were bought with his money every male among the men of abraham's house and circumcised the flesh of their foreskin in the selfsame day as god had said unto him
and abraham was ninety years old and nine when he was circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin
and ishmael his son was thirteen years old when he was circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin
in the selfsame day was abraham circumcised and ishmael his son
and all the men of his house born in the house and bought with money of the stranger were circumcised with him
and the lord appeared unto him in the plains of mamre and he sat in the tent door in the heat of the day
and he lift up his eyes and looked and lo three men stood by him and when he saw them he ran to meet them from the tent door and bowed himself toward the ground
and said my lord if now i have found favour in thy sight pass not away i pray thee from thy servant
let a little water i pray you be fetched and wash your feet and rest yourselves under the tree
and i will fetch a morsel of bread and comfort ye your hearts after that ye shall pass on for therefore are ye come to your servant and they said so do as thou hast said
and abraham hastened into the tent unto sarah and said make ready quickly three measures of fine meal knead it and make cakes upon the hearth
and abraham ran unto the herd and fetcht a calf tender and good and gave it unto a young man and he hasted to dress it
and he took butter and milk and the calf which he had dressed and set it before them and he stood by them under the tree and they did eat
and they said unto him where is sarah thy wife and he said behold in the tent
and he said i will certainly return unto thee according to the time of life and lo sarah thy wife shall have a son and sarah heard it in the tent door which was behind him
now abraham and sarah were old and well stricken in age and it ceased to be with sarah after the manner of women
therefore sarah laughed within herself saying after i am waxed old shall i have pleasure my lord being old also
and the lord said unto abraham wherefore did sarah laugh saying shall i of a surety bear a child which am old
is any thing too hard for the lord at the time appointed i will return unto thee according to the time of life and sarah shall have a son
then sarah denied saying i laughed not for she was afraid and he said nay but thou didst laugh
and the men rose up from thence and looked toward sodom and abraham went with them to bring them on the way
and the lord said shall i hide from abraham that thing which i do
seeing that abraham shall surely become a great and mighty nation and all the nations of the earth shall be blessed in him
for i know him that he will command his children and his household after him and they shall keep the way of the lord to do justice and judgment that the lord may bring upon abraham that which he hath spoken of him
and the lord said because the cry of sodom and gomorrah is great and because their sin is very grievous
i will go down now and see whether they have done altogether according to the cry of it which is come unto me and if not i will know
and the men turned their faces from thence and went toward sodom but abraham stood yet before the lord
and abraham drew near and said wilt thou also destroy the righteous with the wicked
peradventure there be fifty righteous within the city wilt thou also destroy and not spare the place for the fifty righteous that are therein
that be far from thee to do after this manner to slay the righteous with the wicked and that the righteous should be as the wicked that be far from thee shall not the judge of all the earth do right
and the lord said if i find in sodom fifty righteous within the city then i will spare all the place for their sakes
and abraham answered and said behold now i have taken upon me to speak unto the lord which am but dust and ashes
peradventure there shall lack five of the fifty righteous wilt thou destroy all the city for lack of five and he said if i find there forty and five i will not destroy it
and he spake unto him yet again and said peradventure there shall be forty found there and he said i will not do it for forty's sake
and he said unto him oh let not the lord be angry and i will speak peradventure there shall thirty be found there and he said i will not do it if i find thirty there
and he said behold now i have taken upon me to speak unto the lord peradventure there shall be twenty found there and he said i will not destroy it for twenty's sake
and he said oh let not the lord be angry and i will speak yet but this once peradventure ten shall be found there and he said i will not destroy it for ten's sake
and the lord went his way as soon as he had left communing with abraham and abraham returned unto his place
and there came two angels to sodom at even and lot sat in the gate of sodom and lot seeing them rose up to meet them and he bowed himself with his face toward the ground
and he said behold now my lords turn in i pray you into your servant's house and tarry all night and wash your feet and ye shall rise up early and go on your ways and they said nay but we will abide in the street all night
and he pressed upon them greatly and they turned in unto him and entered into his house and he made them a feast and did bake unleavened bread and they did eat
but before they lay down the men of the city even the men of sodom compassed the house round both old and young all the people from every quarter
and they called unto lot and said unto him where are the men which came in to thee this night bring them out unto us that we may know them
and lot went out at the door unto them and shut the door after him
and said i pray you brethren do not so wickedly
behold now i have two daughters which have not known man let me i pray you bring them out unto you and do ye to them as is good in your eyes only unto these men do nothing for therefore came they under the shadow of my roof
and they said stand back and they said again this one fellow came in to sojourn and he will needs be a judge now will we deal worse with thee than with them and they pressed sore upon the man even lot and came near to break the door
but the men put forth their hand and pulled lot into the house to them and shut to the door
and they smote the men that were at the door of the house with blindness both small and great so that they wearied themselves to find the door
and the men said unto lot hast thou here any besides son in law and thy sons and thy daughters and whatsoever thou hast in the city bring them out of this place
for we will destroy this place because the cry of them is waxen great before the face of the lord and the lord hath sent us to destroy it
and lot went out and spake unto his sons in law which married his daughters and said up get you out of this place for the lord will destroy this city but he seemed as one that mocked unto his sons in law
and when the morning arose then the angels hastened lot saying arise take thy wife and thy two daughters which are here lest thou be consumed in the iniquity of the city
and while he lingered the men laid hold upon his hand and upon the hand of his wife and upon the hand of his two daughters the lord being merciful unto him and they brought him forth and set him without the city
and it came to pass when they had brought them forth abroad that he said escape for thy life look not behind thee neither stay thou in all the plain escape to the mountain lest thou be consumed
and lot said unto them oh not so my lord
behold now thy servant hath found grace in thy sight and thou hast magnified thy mercy which thou hast shewed unto me in saving my life and i cannot escape to the mountain lest some evil take me and i die
behold now this city is near to flee unto and it is a little one oh let me escape thither is it not a little one and my soul shall live
and he said unto him see i have accepted thee concerning this thing also that i will not overthrow this city for the which thou hast spoken
haste thee escape thither for i cannot do anything till thou be come thither therefore the name of the city was called zoar
the sun was risen upon the earth when lot entered into zoar
then the lord rained upon sodom and upon gomorrah brimstone and fire from the lord out of heaven
and he overthrew those cities and all the plain and all the inhabitants of the cities and that which grew upon the ground
but his wife looked back from behind him and she became a pillar of salt
and abraham gat up early in the morning to the place where he stood before the lord
and he looked toward sodom and gomorrah and toward all the land of the plain and beheld and lo the smoke of the country went up as the smoke of a furnace
and it came to pass when god destroyed the cities of the plain that god remembered abraham and sent lot out of the midst of the overthrow when he overthrew the cities in the which lot dwelt
and lot went up out of zoar and dwelt in the mountain and his two daughters with him for he feared to dwell in zoar and he dwelt in a cave he and his two daughters
and the firstborn said unto the younger our father is old and there is not a man in the earth to come in unto us after the manner of all the earth
come let us make our father drink wine and we will lie with him that we may preserve seed of our father
and they made their father drink wine that night and the firstborn went in and lay with her father and he perceived not when she lay down nor when she arose
and it came to pass on the morrow that the firstborn said unto the younger behold i lay yesternight with my father let us make him drink wine this night also and go thou in and lie with him that we may preserve seed of our father
and they made their father drink wine that night also and the younger arose and lay with him and he perceived not when she lay down nor when she arose
thus were both the daughters of lot with child by their father
and the first born bare a son and called his name moab the same is the father of the moabites unto this day
and the younger she also bare a son and called his name benammi the same is the father of the children of ammon unto this day
and abraham journeyed from thence toward the south country and dwelled between kadesh and shur and sojourned in gerar
and abraham said of sarah his wife she is my sister and abimelech king of gerar sent and took sarah
but god came to abimelech in a dream by night and said to him behold thou art but a dead man for the woman which thou hast taken for she is a man's wife
but abimelech had not come near her and he said lord wilt thou slay also a righteous nation
said he not unto me she is my sister and she even she herself said he is my brother in the integrity of my heart and innocency of my hands have i done this
and god said unto him in a dream yea i know that thou didst this in the integrity of thy heart for i also withheld thee from sinning against me therefore suffered i thee not to touch her
now therefore restore the man his wife for he is a prophet and he shall pray for thee and thou shalt live and if thou restore her not know thou that thou shalt surely die thou and all that are thine
therefore abimelech rose early in the morning and called all his servants and told all these things in their ears and the men were sore afraid
then abimelech called abraham and said unto him what hast thou done unto us and what have i offended thee that thou hast brought on me and on my kingdom a great sin thou hast done deeds unto me that ought not to be done
and abimelech said unto abraham what sawest thou that thou hast done this thing
and abraham said because i thought surely the fear of god is not in this place and they will slay me for my wife's sake
and yet indeed she is my sister she is the daughter of my father but not the daughter of my mother and she became my wife
and it came to pass when god caused me to wander from my father's house that i said unto her this is thy kindness which thou shalt shew unto me at every place whither we shall come say of me he is my brother
and abimelech took sheep and oxen and menservants and womenservants and gave them unto abraham and restored him sarah his wife
and abimelech said behold my land is before thee dwell where it pleaseth thee
and unto sarah he said behold i have given thy brother a thousand pieces of silver behold he is to thee a covering of the eyes unto all that are with thee and with all other thus she was reproved
so abraham prayed unto god and god healed abimelech and his wife and his maidservants and they bare children
for the lord had fast closed up all the wombs of the house of abimelech because of sarah abraham's wife
and the lord visited sarah as he had said and the lord did unto sarah as he had spoken
for sarah conceived and bare abraham a son in his old age at the set time of which god had spoken to him
and abraham called the name of his son that was born unto him whom sarah bare to him isaac
and abraham circumcised his son isaac being eight days old as god had commanded him
and abraham was an hundred years old when his son isaac was born unto him
and sarah said god hath made me to laugh so that all that hear will laugh with me
and she said who would have said unto abraham that sarah should have given children suck for i have born him a son in his old age
and the child grew and was weaned and abraham made a great feast the same day that isaac was weaned
and sarah saw the son of hagar the egyptian which she had born unto abraham mocking
wherefore she said unto abraham cast out this bondwoman and her son for the son of this bondwoman shall not be heir with my son even with isaac
and the thing was very grievous in abraham's sight because of his son
and god said unto abraham let it not be grievous in thy sight because of the lad and because of thy bondwoman in all that sarah hath said unto thee hearken unto her voice for in isaac shall thy seed be called
and also of the son of the bondwoman will i make a nation because he is thy seed
and abraham rose up early in the morning and took bread and a bottle of water and gave it unto hagar putting it on her shoulder and the child and sent her away and she departed and wandered in the wilderness of beersheba
and the water was spent in the bottle and she cast the child under one of the shrubs
and she went and sat her down over against him a good way off as it were a bow shot for she said let me not see the death of the child and she sat over against him and lift up her voice and wept
and god heard the voice of the lad and the angel of god called to hagar out of heaven and said unto her what aileth thee hagar fear not for god hath heard the voice of the lad where he is
arise lift up the lad and hold him in thine hand for i will make him a great nation
and god opened her eyes and she saw a well of water and she went and filled the bottle with water and gave the lad drink
and god was with the lad and he grew and dwelt in the wilderness and became an archer
and he dwelt in the wilderness of paran and his mother took him a wife out of the land of egypt
and it came to pass at that time that abimelech and phichol the chief captain of his host spake unto abraham saying god is with thee in all that thou doest
now therefore swear unto me here by god that thou wilt not deal falsely with me nor with my son nor with my son's son but according to the kindness that i have done unto thee thou shalt do unto me and to the land wherein thou hast sojourned
and abraham said i will swear
and abraham reproved abimelech because of a well of water which abimelech's servants had violently taken away
and abimelech said i wot not who hath done this thing neither didst thou tell me neither yet heard i of it but to day
and abraham took sheep and oxen and gave them unto abimelech and both of them made a covenant
and abraham set seven ewe lambs of the flock by themselves
and abimelech said unto abraham what mean these seven ewe lambs which thou hast set by themselves
and he said for these seven ewe lambs shalt thou take of my hand that they may be a witness unto me that i have digged this well
wherefore he called that place beersheba because there they sware both of them
thus they made a covenant at beersheba then abimelech rose up and phichol the chief captain of his host and they returned into the land of the philistines
and abraham planted a grove in beersheba and called there on the name of the lord the everlasting god
and abraham sojourned in the philistines land many days
and it came to pass after these things that god did tempt abraham and said unto him abraham and he said behold here i am
and he said take now thy son thine only son isaac whom thou lovest and get thee into the land of moriah and offer him there for a burnt offering upon one of the mountains which i will tell thee of
and abraham rose up early in the morning and saddled his ass and took two of his young men with him and isaac his son and clave the wood for the burnt offering and rose up and went unto the place of which god had told him
then on the third day abraham lifted up his eyes and saw the place afar off
and abraham said unto his young men abide ye here with the ass and i and the lad will go yonder and worship and come again to you
and abraham took the wood of the burnt offering and laid it upon isaac his son and he took the fire in his hand and a knife and they went both of them together
and isaac spake unto abraham his father and said my father and he said here am i my son and he said behold the fire and the wood but where is the lamb for a burnt offering
and abraham said my son god will provide himself a lamb for a burnt offering so they went both of them together
and they came to the place which god had told him of and abraham built an altar there and laid the wood in order and bound isaac his son and laid him on the altar upon the wood
and abraham stretched forth his hand and took the knife to slay his son
and the angel of the lord called unto him out of heaven and said abraham abraham and he said here am i
and he said lay not thine hand upon the lad neither do thou any thing unto him for now i know that thou fearest god seeing thou hast not withheld thy son thine only son from me
and abraham lifted up his eyes and looked and behold behind him a ram caught in a thicket by his horns and abraham went and took the ram and offered him up for a burnt offering in the stead of his son
and abraham called the name of that place jehovahjireh as it is said to this day in the mount of the lord it shall be seen
and the angel of the lord called unto abraham out of heaven the second time
and said by myself have i sworn saith the lord for because thou hast done this thing and hast not withheld thy son thine only son
that in blessing i will bless thee and in multiplying i will multiply thy seed as the stars of the heaven and as the sand which is upon the sea shore and thy seed shall possess the gate of his enemies
and in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed because thou hast obeyed my voice
so abraham returned unto his young men and they rose up and went together to beersheba and abraham dwelt at beersheba
and it came to pass after these things that it was told abraham saying behold milcah she hath also born children unto thy brother nahor
huz his firstborn and buz his brother and kemuel the father of aram
and chesed and hazo and pildash and jidlaph and bethuel
and bethuel begat rebekah these eight milcah did bear to nahor abraham's brother
and his concubine whose name was reumah she bare also tebah and gaham and thahash and maachah
and sarah was an hundred and seven and twenty years old these were the years of the life of sarah
and sarah died in kirjatharba the same is hebron in the land of canaan and abraham came to mourn for sarah and to weep for her
and abraham stood up from before his dead and spake unto the sons of heth saying
i am a stranger and a sojourner with you give me a possession of a buryingplace with you that i may bury my dead out of my sight
and the children of heth answered abraham saying unto him
hear us my lord thou art a mighty prince among us in the choice of our sepulchres bury thy dead none of us shall withhold from thee his sepulchre but that thou mayest bury thy dead
and abraham stood up and bowed himself to the people of the land even to the children of heth
and he communed with them saying if it be your mind that i should bury my dead out of my sight hear me and intreat for me to ephron the son of zohar
that he may give me the cave of machpelah which he hath which is in the end of his field for as much money as it is worth he shall give it me for a possession of a buryingplace amongst you
and ephron dwelt among the children of heth and ephron the hittite answered abraham in the audience of the children of heth even of all that went in at the gate of his city saying
nay my lord hear me the field give i thee and the cave that is therein i give it thee in the presence of the sons of my people give i it thee bury thy dead
and abraham bowed down himself before the people of the land
and he spake unto ephron in the audience of the people of the land saying but if thou wilt give it i pray thee hear me i will give thee money for the field take it of me and i will bury my dead there
and ephron answered abraham saying unto him
my lord hearken unto me the land is worth four hundred shekels of silver what is that betwixt me and thee bury therefore thy dead
and abraham hearkened unto ephron and abraham weighed to ephron the silver which he had named in the audience of the sons of heth four hundred shekels of silver current money with the merchant
and the field of ephron which was in machpelah which was before mamre the field and the cave which was therein and all the trees that were in the field that were in all the borders round about were made sure
unto abraham for a possession in the presence of the children of heth before all that went in at the gate of his city
and after this abraham buried sarah his wife in the cave of the field of machpelah before mamre the same is hebron in the land of canaan
and the field and the cave that is therein were made sure unto abraham for a possession of a buryingplace by the sons of heth
and abraham was old and well stricken in age and the lord had blessed abraham in all things
and abraham said unto his eldest servant of his house that ruled over all that he had put i pray thee thy hand under my thigh
and i will make thee swear by the lord the god of heaven and the god of the earth that thou shalt not take a wife unto my son of the daughters of the canaanites among whom i dwell
but thou shalt go unto my country and to my kindred and take a wife unto my son isaac
and the servant said unto him peradventure the woman will not be willing to follow me unto this land must i needs bring thy son again unto the land from whence thou camest
and abraham said unto him beware thou that thou bring not my son thither again
