richard your right depends not on his life or death
edward now you are heir therefore enjoy it now
 by giving the house of lancaster leave to breathe
 it will outrun you father in the end
york i took an oath that he should quietly reign
edward but for a kingdom any oath may be broken
 i would break a thousand oaths to reign one year
richard no god forbid your grace should be forsworn
york i shall be if i claim by open war
richard i'll prove the contrary if you'll hear me speak
york thou canst not son it is impossible
richard an oath is of no moment being not took
 before a true and lawful magistrate
 that hath authority over him that swears
 henry had none but did usurp the place
 then seeing twas he that made you to depose
 your oath my lord is vain and frivolous
 therefore to arms and father do but think
 how sweet a thing it is to wear a crown
 within whose circuit is elysium
 and all that poets feign of bliss and joy
 why do we finger thus i cannot rest
 until the white rose that i wear be dyed
 even in the lukewarm blood of henry's heart
york richard enough i will be king or die
 brother thou shalt to london presently
 and whet on warwick to this enterprise
 thou richard shalt to the duke of norfolk
 and tell him privily of our intent
 you edward shall unto my lord cobham
 with whom the kentishmen will willingly rise
 in them i trust for they are soldiers
 witty courteous liberal full of spirit
 while you are thus employ'd what resteth more
 but that i seek occasion how to rise
 and yet the king not privy to my drift
 nor any of the house of lancaster
 enter a messenger
 but stay what news why comest thou in such post
messenger the queen with all the northern earls and lords
 intend here to besiege you in your castle
 she is hard by with twenty thousand men
 and therefore fortify your hold my lord
york ay with my sword what think'st thou that we fear them
 edward and richard you shall stay with me
 my brother montague shall post to london
 let noble warwick cobham and the rest
 whom we have left protectors of the king
 with powerful policy strengthen themselves
 and trust not simple henry nor his oaths
montague brother i go i'll win them fear it not
 and thus most humbly i do take my leave
 exit
 enter john mortimer and hugh mortimer
 sir john and sir hugh mortimer mine uncles
 you are come to sandal in a happy hour
 the army of the queen mean to besiege us
john mortimer she shall not need we'll meet her in the field
york what with five thousand men
richard ay with five hundred father for a need
 a woman's general what should we fear
 a march afar off
edward i hear their drums let's set our men in order
 and issue forth and bid them battle straight
york five men to twenty though the odds be great
 i doubt not uncle of our victory
 many a battle have i won in france
 when as the enemy hath been ten to one
 why should i not now have the like success
 alarum exeunt
 3 king henry vi
act i
scene iii field of battle betwixt sandal castle and wakefield
 alarums enter rutland and his tutor
rutland ah whither shall i fly to scape their hands
 ah tutor look where bloody clifford comes
 enter clifford and soldiers
clifford chaplain away thy priesthood saves thy life
 as for the brat of this accursed duke
 whose father slew my father he shall die
tutor and i my lord will bear him company
clifford soldiers away with him
tutor ah clifford murder not this innocent child
 lest thou be hated both of god and man
 exit dragged off by soldiers
clifford how now is he dead already or is it fear
 that makes him close his eyes i'll open them
rutland so looks the pentup lion o'er the wretch
 that trembles under his devouring paws
 and so he walks insulting o'er his prey
 and so he comes to rend his limbs asunder
 ah gentle clifford kill me with thy sword
 and not with such a cruel threatening look
 sweet clifford hear me speak before i die
 i am too mean a subject for thy wrath
 be thou revenged on men and let me live
clifford in vain thou speak'st poor boy my father's blood
 hath stopp'd the passage where thy words should enter
rutland then let my father's blood open it again
 he is a man and clifford cope with him
clifford had thy brethren here their lives and thine
 were not revenge sufficient for me
 no if i digg'd up thy forefathers graves
 and hung their rotten coffins up in chains
 it could not slake mine ire nor ease my heart
 the sight of any of the house of york
 is as a fury to torment my soul
 and till i root out their accursed line
 and leave not one alive i live in hell
 therefore
 lifting his hand
rutland o let me pray before i take my death
 to thee i pray sweet clifford pity me
clifford such pity as my rapier's point affords
rutland i never did thee harm why wilt thou slay me
clifford thy father hath
rutland but twas ere i was born
 thou hast one son for his sake pity me
 lest in revenge thereof sith god is just
 he be as miserably slain as i
 ah let me live in prison all my days
 and when i give occasion of offence
 then let me die for now thou hast no cause
clifford no cause
 thy father slew my father therefore die
 stabs him
rutland di faciant laudis summa sit ista tuae
 dies
clifford plantagenet i come plantagenet
 and this thy son's blood cleaving to my blade
 shall rust upon my weapon till thy blood
 congeal'd with this do make me wipe off both
 exit
 3 king henry vi
act i
scene iv another part of the field
 alarum enter york
york the army of the queen hath got the field
 my uncles both are slain in rescuing me
 and all my followers to the eager foe
 turn back and fly like ships before the wind
 or lambs pursued by hungerstarved wolves
 my sons god knows what hath bechanced them
 but this i know they have demean'd themselves
 like men born to renown by life or death
 three times did richard make a lane to me
 and thrice cried courage father fight it out'
 and full as oft came edward to my side
 with purple falchion painted to the hilt
 in blood of those that had encounter'd him
 and when the hardiest warriors did retire
 richard cried charge and give no foot of ground'
 and cried a crown or else a glorious tomb
 a sceptre or an earthly sepulchre'
 with this we charged again but out alas
 we bodged again as i have seen a swan
 with bootless labour swim against the tide
 and spend her strength with overmatching waves
 a short alarum within
 ah hark the fatal followers do pursue
 and i am faint and cannot fly their fury
 and were i strong i would not shun their fury
 the sands are number'd that make up my life
 here must i stay and here my life must end
 enter queen margaret clifford northumberland
 prince edward and soldiers
 come bloody clifford rough northumberland
 i dare your quenchless fury to more rage
 i am your butt and i abide your shot
northumberland yield to our mercy proud plantagenet
clifford ay to such mercy as his ruthless arm
 with downright payment show'd unto my father
 now phaethon hath tumbled from his car
 and made an evening at the noontide prick
york my ashes as the phoenix may bring forth
 a bird that will revenge upon you all
 and in that hope i throw mine eyes to heaven
 scorning whate'er you can afflict me with
 why come you not what multitudes and fear
clifford so cowards fight when they can fly no further
 so doves do peck the falcon's piercing talons
 so desperate thieves all hopeless of their lives
 breathe out invectives gainst the officers
york o clifford but bethink thee once again
 and in thy thought o'errun my former time
 and if though canst for blushing view this face
 and bite thy tongue that slanders him with cowardice
 whose frown hath made thee faint and fly ere this
clifford i will not bandy with thee word for word
 but buckle with thee blows twice two for one
queen margaret hold valiant clifford for a thousand causes
 i would prolong awhile the traitor's life
 wrath makes him deaf speak thou northumberland
northumberland hold clifford do not honour him so much
 to prick thy finger though to wound his heart
 what valour were it when a cur doth grin
 for one to thrust his hand between his teeth
 when he might spurn him with his foot away
 it is war's prize to take all vantages
 and ten to one is no impeach of valour
