 exeunt
 love's labours lost
act v
scene ii the same
 enter the princess katharine rosaline and maria
princess sweet hearts we shall be rich ere we depart
 if fairings come thus plentifully in
 a lady wall'd about with diamonds
 look you what i have from the loving king
rosaline madame came nothing else along with that
princess nothing but this yes as much love in rhyme
 as would be cramm'd up in a sheet of paper
 writ o both sides the leaf margent and all
 that he was fain to seal on cupid's name
rosaline that was the way to make his godhead wax
 for he hath been five thousand years a boy
katharine ay and a shrewd unhappy gallows too
rosaline you'll ne'er be friends with him a kill'd your sister
katharine he made her melancholy sad and heavy
 and so she died had she been light like you
 of such a merry nimble stirring spirit
 she might ha been a grandam ere she died
 and so may you for a light heart lives long
rosaline what's your dark meaning mouse of this light word
katharine a light condition in a beauty dark
rosaline we need more light to find your meaning out
katharine you'll mar the light by taking it in snuff
 therefore i'll darkly end the argument
rosaline look what you do you do it still i the dark
katharine so do not you for you are a light wench
rosaline indeed i weigh not you and therefore light
katharine you weigh me not o that's you care not for me
rosaline great reason for past cure is still past care'
princess well bandied both a set of wit well play'd
 but rosaline you have a favour too
 who sent it and what is it
rosaline i would you knew
 an if my face were but as fair as yours
 my favour were as great be witness this
 nay i have verses too i thank biron
 the numbers true and were the numbering too
 i were the fairest goddess on the ground
 i am compared to twenty thousand fairs
 o he hath drawn my picture in his letter
princess any thing like
rosaline much in the letters nothing in the praise
princess beauteous as ink a good conclusion
katharine fair as a text b in a copybook
rosaline ware pencils ho let me not die your debtor
 my red dominical my golden letter
 o that your face were not so full of o's
katharine a pox of that jest and i beshrew all shrows
princess but katharine what was sent to you from fair dumain
katharine madam this glove
princess did he not send you twain
katharine yes madam and moreover
 some thousand verses of a faithful lover
 a huge translation of hypocrisy
 vilely compiled profound simplicity
maria this and these pearls to me sent longaville
 the letter is too long by half a mile
princess i think no less dost thou not wish in heart
 the chain were longer and the letter short
maria ay or i would these hands might never part
princess we are wise girls to mock our lovers so
rosaline they are worse fools to purchase mocking so
 that same biron i'll torture ere i go
 o that i knew he were but in by the week
 how i would make him fawn and beg and seek
 and wait the season and observe the times
 and spend his prodigal wits in bootless rhymes
 and shape his service wholly to my hests
 and make him proud to make me proud that jests
 so perttauntlike would i o'ersway his state
 that he should be my fool and i his fate
princess none are so surely caught when they are catch'd
 as wit turn'd fool folly in wisdom hatch'd
 hath wisdom's warrant and the help of school
 and wit's own grace to grace a learned fool
rosaline the blood of youth burns not with such excess
 as gravity's revolt to wantonness
maria folly in fools bears not so strong a note
 as foolery in the wise when wit doth dote
 since all the power thereof it doth apply
 to prove by wit worth in simplicity
princess here comes boyet and mirth is in his face
 enter boyet
boyet o i am stabb'd with laughter where's her grace
princess thy news boyet
boyet prepare madam prepare
 arm wenches arm encounters mounted are
 against your peace love doth approach disguised
 armed in arguments you'll be surprised
 muster your wits stand in your own defence
 or hide your heads like cowards and fly hence
princess saint denis to saint cupid what are they
 that charge their breath against us say scout say
boyet under the cool shade of a sycamore
 i thought to close mine eyes some half an hour
 when lo to interrupt my purposed rest
 toward that shade i might behold addrest
 the king and his companions warily
 i stole into a neighbour thicket by
 and overheard what you shall overhear
 that by and by disguised they will be here
 their herald is a pretty knavish page
 that well by heart hath conn'd his embassage
 action and accent did they teach him there
 thus must thou speak and thus thy body bear'
 and ever and anon they made a doubt
 presence majestical would put him out
 for quoth the king an angel shalt thou see
 yet fear not thou but speak audaciously'
 the boy replied an angel is not evil
 i should have fear'd her had she been a devil'
 with that all laugh'd and clapp'd him on the shoulder
 making the bold wag by their praises bolder
 one rubb'd his elbow thus and fleer'd and swore
 a better speech was never spoke before
 another with his finger and his thumb
 cried via we will do't come what will come'
 the third he caper'd and cried all goes well'
 the fourth turn'd on the toe and down he fell
 with that they all did tumble on the ground
 with such a zealous laughter so profound
 that in this spleen ridiculous appears
 to cheque their folly passion's solemn tears
princess but what but what come they to visit us
boyet they do they do and are apparell'd thus
 like muscovites or russians as i guess
 their purpose is to parle to court and dance
 and every one his lovefeat will advance
 unto his several mistress which they'll know
 by favours several which they did bestow
princess and will they so the gallants shall be task'd
 for ladies we shall every one be mask'd
 and not a man of them shall have the grace
 despite of suit to see a lady's face
 hold rosaline this favour thou shalt wear
 and then the king will court thee for his dear
 hold take thou this my sweet and give me thine
 so shall biron take me for rosaline
 and change your favours too so shall your loves
 woo contrary deceived by these removes
rosaline come on then wear the favours most in sight
katharine but in this changing what is your intent
princess the effect of my intent is to cross theirs
 they do it but in mocking merriment
 and mock for mock is only my intent
 their several counsels they unbosom shall
 to loves mistook and so be mock'd withal
 upon the next occasion that we meet
 with visages displayed to talk and greet
rosaline but shall we dance if they desire to't
princess no to the death we will not move a foot
 nor to their penn'd speech render we no grace
 but while tis spoke each turn away her face
