the young lions do lack and suffer hunger but they that seek the lord shall not want any good thing
come ye children hearken unto me i will teach you the fear of the lord
what man is he that desireth life and loveth many days that he may see good
keep thy tongue from evil and thy lips from speaking guile
depart from evil and do good seek peace and pursue it
the eyes of the lord are upon the righteous and his ears are open unto their cry
the face of the lord is against them that do evil to cut off the remembrance of them from the earth
the righteous cry and the lord heareth and delivereth them out of all their troubles
the lord is nigh unto them that are of a broken heart and saveth such as be of a contrite spirit
many are the afflictions of the righteous but the lord delivereth him out of them all
he keepeth all his bones not one of them is broken
evil shall slay the wicked and they that hate the righteous shall be desolate
the lord redeemeth the soul of his servants and none of them that trust in him shall be desolate
plead my cause o lord with them that strive with me fight against them that fight against me
take hold of shield and buckler and stand up for mine help
draw out also the spear and stop the way against them that persecute me say unto my soul i am thy salvation
let them be confounded and put to shame that seek after my soul let them be turned back and brought to confusion that devise my hurt
let them be as chaff before the wind and let the angel of the lord chase them
let their way be dark and slippery and let the angel of the lord persecute them
for without cause have they hid for me their net in a pit which without cause they have digged for my soul
let destruction come upon him at unawares and let his net that he hath hid catch himself into that very destruction let him fall
and my soul shall be joyful in the lord it shall rejoice in his salvation
all my bones shall say lord who is like unto thee which deliverest the poor from him that is too strong for him yea the poor and the needy from him that spoileth him
false witnesses did rise up they laid to my charge things that i knew not
they rewarded me evil for good to the spoiling of my soul
but as for me when they were sick my clothing was sackcloth i humbled my soul with fasting and my prayer returned into mine own bosom
i behaved myself as though he had been my friend or brother i bowed down heavily as one that mourneth for his mother
but in mine adversity they rejoiced and gathered themselves together yea the abjects gathered themselves together against me and i knew it not they did tear me and ceased not
with hypocritical mockers in feasts they gnashed upon me with their teeth
lord how long wilt thou look on rescue my soul from their destructions my darling from the lions
i will give thee thanks in the great congregation i will praise thee among much people
let not them that are mine enemies wrongfully rejoice over me neither let them wink with the eye that hate me without a cause
for they speak not peace but they devise deceitful matters against them that are quiet in the land
yea they opened their mouth wide against me and said aha aha our eye hath seen it
this thou hast seen o lord keep not silence o lord be not far from me
stir up thyself and awake to my judgment even unto my cause my god and my lord
judge me o lord my god according to thy righteousness and let them not rejoice over me
let them not say in their hearts ah so would we have it let them not say we have swallowed him up
let them be ashamed and brought to confusion together that rejoice at mine hurt let them be clothed with shame and dishonour that magnify themselves against me
let them shout for joy and be glad that favour my righteous cause yea let them say continually let the lord be magnified which hath pleasure in the prosperity of his servant
and my tongue shall speak of thy righteousness and of thy praise all the day long
the transgression of the wicked saith within my heart that there is no fear of god before his eyes
for he flattereth himself in his own eyes until his iniquity be found to be hateful
the words of his mouth are iniquity and deceit he hath left off to be wise and to do good
he deviseth mischief upon his bed he setteth himself in a way that is not good he abhorreth not evil
thy mercy o lord is in the heavens and thy faithfulness reacheth unto the clouds
thy righteousness is like the great mountains thy judgments are a great deep o lord thou preservest man and beast
how excellent is thy lovingkindness o god therefore the children of men put their trust under the shadow of thy wings
they shall be abundantly satisfied with the fatness of thy house and thou shalt make them drink of the river of thy pleasures
for with thee is the fountain of life in thy light shall we see light
o continue thy lovingkindness unto them that know thee and thy righteousness to the upright in heart
let not the foot of pride come against me and let not the hand of the wicked remove me
there are the workers of iniquity fallen they are cast down and shall not be able to rise
fret not thyself because of evildoers neither be thou envious against the workers of iniquity
for they shall soon be cut down like the grass and wither as the green herb
trust in the lord and do good so shalt thou dwell in the land and verily thou shalt be fed
delight thyself also in the lord and he shall give thee the desires of thine heart
commit thy way unto the lord trust also in him and he shall bring it to pass
and he shall bring forth thy righteousness as the light and thy judgment as the noonday
rest in the lord and wait patiently for him fret not thyself because of him who prospereth in his way because of the man who bringeth wicked devices to pass
cease from anger and forsake wrath fret not thyself in any wise to do evil
for evildoers shall be cut off but those that wait upon the lord they shall inherit the earth
for yet a little while and the wicked shall not be yea thou shalt diligently consider his place and it shall not be
but the meek shall inherit the earth and shall delight themselves in the abundance of peace
the wicked plotteth against the just and gnasheth upon him with his teeth
the lord shall laugh at him for he seeth that his day is coming
the wicked have drawn out the sword and have bent their bow to cast down the poor and needy and to slay such as be of upright conversation
their sword shall enter into their own heart and their bows shall be broken
a little that a righteous man hath is better than the riches of many wicked
for the arms of the wicked shall be broken but the lord upholdeth the righteous
the lord knoweth the days of the upright and their inheritance shall be for ever
they shall not be ashamed in the evil time and in the days of famine they shall be satisfied
but the wicked shall perish and the enemies of the lord shall be as the fat of lambs they shall consume into smoke shall they consume away
the wicked borroweth and payeth not again but the righteous sheweth mercy and giveth
for such as be blessed of him shall inherit the earth and they that be cursed of him shall be cut off
the steps of a good man are ordered by the lord and he delighteth in his way
though he fall he shall not be utterly cast down for the lord upholdeth him with his hand
i have been young and now am old yet have i not seen the righteous forsaken nor his seed begging bread
he is ever merciful and lendeth and his seed is blessed
depart from evil and do good and dwell for evermore
for the lord loveth judgment and forsaketh not his saints they are preserved for ever but the seed of the wicked shall be cut off
the righteous shall inherit the land and dwell therein for ever
the mouth of the righteous speaketh wisdom and his tongue talketh of judgment
the law of his god is in his heart none of his steps shall slide
the wicked watcheth the righteous and seeketh to slay him
the lord will not leave him in his hand nor condemn him when he is judged
wait on the lord and keep his way and he shall exalt thee to inherit the land when the wicked are cut off thou shalt see it
i have seen the wicked in great power and spreading himself like a green bay tree
yet he passed away and lo he was not yea i sought him but he could not be found
mark the perfect man and behold the upright for the end of that man is peace
but the transgressors shall be destroyed together the end of the wicked shall be cut off
but the salvation of the righteous is of the lord he is their strength in the time of trouble
and the lord shall help them and deliver them he shall deliver them from the wicked and save them because they trust in him
o lord rebuke me not in thy wrath neither chasten me in thy hot displeasure
for thine arrows stick fast in me and thy hand presseth me sore
there is no soundness in my flesh because of thine anger neither is there any rest in my bones because of my sin
for mine iniquities are gone over mine head as an heavy burden they are too heavy for me
my wounds stink and are corrupt because of my foolishness
i am troubled i am bowed down greatly i go mourning all the day long
for my loins are filled with a loathsome disease and there is no soundness in my flesh
i am feeble and sore broken i have roared by reason of the disquietness of my heart
lord all my desire is before thee and my groaning is not hid from thee
my heart panteth my strength faileth me as for the light of mine eyes it also is gone from me
my lovers and my friends stand aloof from my sore and my kinsmen stand afar off
they also that seek after my life lay snares for me and they that seek my hurt speak mischievous things and imagine deceits all the day long
but i as a deaf man heard not and i was as a dumb man that openeth not his mouth
thus i was as a man that heareth not and in whose mouth are no reproofs
for in thee o lord do i hope thou wilt hear o lord my god
for i said hear me lest otherwise they should rejoice over me when my foot slippeth they magnify themselves against me
for i am ready to halt and my sorrow is continually before me
for i will declare mine iniquity i will be sorry for my sin
but mine enemies are lively and they are strong and they that hate me wrongfully are multiplied
they also that render evil for good are mine adversaries because i follow the thing that good is
forsake me not o lord o my god be not far from me
make haste to help me o lord my salvation
i said i will take heed to my ways that i sin not with my tongue i will keep my mouth with a bridle while the wicked is before me
i was dumb with silence i held my peace even from good and my sorrow was stirred
my heart was hot within me while i was musing the fire burned then spake i with my tongue
lord make me to know mine end and the measure of my days what it is that i may know how frail i am
behold thou hast made my days as an handbreadth and mine age is as nothing before thee verily every man at his best state is altogether vanity selah
surely every man walketh in a vain shew surely they are disquieted in vain he heapeth up riches and knoweth not who shall gather them
and now lord what wait i for my hope is in thee
deliver me from all my transgressions make me not the reproach of the foolish
i was dumb i opened not my mouth because thou didst it
remove thy stroke away from me i am consumed by the blow of thine hand
when thou with rebukes dost correct man for iniquity thou makest his beauty to consume away like a moth surely every man is vanity selah
hear my prayer o lord and give ear unto my cry hold not thy peace at my tears for i am a stranger with thee and a sojourner as all my fathers were
o spare me that i may recover strength before i go hence and be no more
i waited patiently for the lord and he inclined unto me and heard my cry
he brought me up also out of an horrible pit out of the miry clay and set my feet upon a rock and established my goings
and he hath put a new song in my mouth even praise unto our god many shall see it and fear and shall trust in the lord
blessed is that man that maketh the lord his trust and respecteth not the proud nor such as turn aside to lies
many o lord my god are thy wonderful works which thou hast done and thy thoughts which are to usward they cannot be reckoned up in order unto thee if i would declare and speak of them they are more than can be numbered
sacrifice and offering thou didst not desire mine ears hast thou opened burnt offering and sin offering hast thou not required
then said i lo i come in the volume of the book it is written of me
i delight to do thy will o my god yea thy law is within my heart
i have preached righteousness in the great congregation lo i have not refrained my lips o lord thou knowest
i have not hid thy righteousness within my heart i have declared thy faithfulness and thy salvation i have not concealed thy lovingkindness and thy truth from the great congregation
withhold not thou thy tender mercies from me o lord let thy lovingkindness and thy truth continually preserve me
for innumerable evils have compassed me about mine iniquities have taken hold upon me so that i am not able to look up they are more than the hairs of mine head therefore my heart faileth me
be pleased o lord to deliver me o lord make haste to help me
let them be ashamed and confounded together that seek after my soul to destroy it let them be driven backward and put to shame that wish me evil
let them be desolate for a reward of their shame that say unto me aha aha
let all those that seek thee rejoice and be glad in thee let such as love thy salvation say continually the lord be magnified
but i am poor and needy yet the lord thinketh upon me thou art my help and my deliverer make no tarrying o my god
blessed is he that considereth the poor the lord will deliver him in time of trouble
the lord will preserve him and keep him alive and he shall be blessed upon the earth and thou wilt not deliver him unto the will of his enemies
the lord will strengthen him upon the bed of languishing thou wilt make all his bed in his sickness
i said lord be merciful unto me heal my soul for i have sinned against thee
mine enemies speak evil of me when shall he die and his name perish
and if he come to see me he speaketh vanity his heart gathereth iniquity to itself when he goeth abroad he telleth it
all that hate me whisper together against me against me do they devise my hurt
an evil disease say they cleaveth fast unto him and now that he lieth he shall rise up no more
yea mine own familiar friend in whom i trusted which did eat of my bread hath lifted up his heel against me
but thou o lord be merciful unto me and raise me up that i may requite them
by this i know that thou favourest me because mine enemy doth not triumph over me
and as for me thou upholdest me in mine integrity and settest me before thy face for ever
blessed be the lord god of israel from everlasting and to everlasting amen and amen
as the hart panteth after the water brooks so panteth my soul after thee o god
my soul thirsteth for god for the living god when shall i come and appear before god
my tears have been my meat day and night while they continually say unto me where is thy god
when i remember these things i pour out my soul in me for i had gone with the multitude i went with them to the house of god with the voice of joy and praise with a multitude that kept holyday
why art thou cast down o my soul and why art thou disquieted in me hope thou in god for i shall yet praise him for the help of his countenance
o my god my soul is cast down within me therefore will i remember thee from the land of jordan and of the hermonites from the hill mizar
deep calleth unto deep at the noise of thy waterspouts all thy waves and thy billows are gone over me
yet the lord will command his lovingkindness in the day time and in the night his song shall be with me and my prayer unto the god of my life
i will say unto god my rock why hast thou forgotten me why go i mourning because of the oppression of the enemy
as with a sword in my bones mine enemies reproach me while they say daily unto me where is thy god
why art thou cast down o my soul and why art thou disquieted within me hope thou in god for i shall yet praise him who is the health of my countenance and my god
judge me o god and plead my cause against an ungodly nation o deliver me from the deceitful and unjust man
for thou art the god of my strength why dost thou cast me off why go i mourning because of the oppression of the enemy
o send out thy light and thy truth let them lead me let them bring me unto thy holy hill and to thy tabernacles
then will i go unto the altar of god unto god my exceeding joy yea upon the harp will i praise thee o god my god
why art thou cast down o my soul and why art thou disquieted within me hope in god for i shall yet praise him who is the health of my countenance and my god
we have heard with our ears o god our fathers have told us what work thou didst in their days in the times of old
how thou didst drive out the heathen with thy hand and plantedst them how thou didst afflict the people and cast them out
for they got not the land in possession by their own sword neither did their own arm save them but thy right hand and thine arm and the light of thy countenance because thou hadst a favour unto them
thou art my king o god command deliverances for jacob
through thee will we push down our enemies through thy name will we tread them under that rise up against us
for i will not trust in my bow neither shall my sword save me
but thou hast saved us from our enemies and hast put them to shame that hated us
in god we boast all the day long and praise thy name for ever selah
but thou hast cast off and put us to shame and goest not forth with our armies
thou makest us to turn back from the enemy and they which hate us spoil for themselves
thou hast given us like sheep appointed for meat and hast scattered us among the heathen
thou sellest thy people for nought and dost not increase thy wealth by their price
thou makest us a reproach to our neighbours a scorn and a derision to them that are round about us
thou makest us a byword among the heathen a shaking of the head among the people
my confusion is continually before me and the shame of my face hath covered me
for the voice of him that reproacheth and blasphemeth by reason of the enemy and avenger
all this is come upon us yet have we not forgotten thee neither have we dealt falsely in thy covenant
our heart is not turned back neither have our steps declined from thy way
though thou hast sore broken us in the place of dragons and covered us with the shadow of death
if we have forgotten the name of our god or stretched out our hands to a strange god
shall not god search this out for he knoweth the secrets of the heart
yea for thy sake are we killed all the day long we are counted as sheep for the slaughter
awake why sleepest thou o lord arise cast us not off for ever
wherefore hidest thou thy face and forgettest our affliction and our oppression
for our soul is bowed down to the dust our belly cleaveth unto the earth
arise for our help and redeem us for thy mercies sake
