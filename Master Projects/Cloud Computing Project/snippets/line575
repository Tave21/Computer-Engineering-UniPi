olivia my servant sir twas never merry world
 since lowly feigning was call'd compliment
 you're servant to the count orsino youth
viola and he is yours and his must needs be yours
 your servant's servant is your servant madam
olivia for him i think not on him for his thoughts
 would they were blanks rather than fill'd with me
viola madam i come to whet your gentle thoughts
 on his behalf
olivia o by your leave i pray you
 i bade you never speak again of him
 but would you undertake another suit
 i had rather hear you to solicit that
 than music from the spheres
viola dear lady
olivia give me leave beseech you i did send
 after the last enchantment you did here
 a ring in chase of you so did i abuse
 myself my servant and i fear me you
 under your hard construction must i sit
 to force that on you in a shameful cunning
 which you knew none of yours what might you think
 have you not set mine honour at the stake
 and baited it with all the unmuzzled thoughts
 that tyrannous heart can think to one of your receiving
 enough is shown a cypress not a bosom
 hideth my heart so let me hear you speak
viola i pity you
olivia that's a degree to love
viola no not a grize for tis a vulgar proof
 that very oft we pity enemies
olivia why then methinks tis time to smile again
 o world how apt the poor are to be proud
 if one should be a prey how much the better
 to fall before the lion than the wolf
 clock strikes
 the clock upbraids me with the waste of time
 be not afraid good youth i will not have you
 and yet when wit and youth is come to harvest
 your were is alike to reap a proper man
 there lies your way due west
viola then westwardho grace and good disposition
 attend your ladyship
 you'll nothing madam to my lord by me
olivia stay
 i prithee tell me what thou thinkest of me
viola that you do think you are not what you are
olivia if i think so i think the same of you
viola then think you right i am not what i am
olivia i would you were as i would have you be
viola would it be better madam than i am
 i wish it might for now i am your fool
olivia o what a deal of scorn looks beautiful
 in the contempt and anger of his lip
 a murderous guilt shows not itself more soon
 than love that would seem hid love's night is noon
 cesario by the roses of the spring
 by maidhood honour truth and every thing
 i love thee so that maugre all thy pride
 nor wit nor reason can my passion hide
 do not extort thy reasons from this clause
 for that i woo thou therefore hast no cause
 but rather reason thus with reason fetter
 love sought is good but given unsought better
viola by innocence i swear and by my youth
 i have one heart one bosom and one truth
 and that no woman has nor never none
 shall mistress be of it save i alone
 and so adieu good madam never more
 will i my master's tears to you deplore
olivia yet come again for thou perhaps mayst move
 that heart which now abhors to like his love

scene ii olivia's house
 enter sir toby belch sir andrew and fabian
sir andrew no faith i'll not stay a jot longer
sir toby belch thy reason dear venom give thy reason
fabian you must needs yield your reason sir andrew
sir andrew marry i saw your niece do more favours to the
 count's servingman than ever she bestowed upon me
 i saw't i the orchard
sir toby belch did she see thee the while old boy tell me that
sir andrew as plain as i see you now
fabian this was a great argument of love in her toward you
sir andrew slight will you make an ass o me
fabian i will prove it legitimate sir upon the oaths of
 judgment and reason
sir toby belch and they have been grandjurymen since before noah
 was a sailor
fabian she did show favour to the youth in your sight only
 to exasperate you to awake your dormouse valour to
 put fire in your heart and brimstone in your liver
 you should then have accosted her and with some
 excellent jests firenew from the mint you should
 have banged the youth into dumbness this was
 looked for at your hand and this was balked the
 double gilt of this opportunity you let time wash
 off and you are now sailed into the north of my
 lady's opinion where you will hang like an icicle
 on a dutchman's beard unless you do redeem it by
 some laudable attempt either of valour or policy
sir andrew an't be any way it must be with valour for policy
 i hate i had as lief be a brownist as a
 politician
sir toby belch why then build me thy fortunes upon the basis of
 valour challenge me the count's youth to fight
 with him hurt him in eleven places my niece shall
 take note of it and assure thyself there is no
 lovebroker in the world can more prevail in man's
 commendation with woman than report of valour
fabian there is no way but this sir andrew
sir andrew will either of you bear me a challenge to him
sir toby belch go write it in a martial hand be curst and brief
 it is no matter how witty so it be eloquent and fun
 of invention taunt him with the licence of ink
 if thou thou'st him some thrice it shall not be
 amiss and as many lies as will lie in thy sheet of
 paper although the sheet were big enough for the
 bed of ware in england set em down go about it
 let there be gall enough in thy ink though thou
 write with a goosepen no matter about it
sir andrew where shall i find you
sir toby belch we'll call thee at the cubiculo go
 exit sir andrew
fabian this is a dear manikin to you sir toby
sir toby belch i have been dear to him lad some two thousand
 strong or so
fabian we shall have a rare letter from him but you'll
 not deliver't
sir toby belch never trust me then and by all means stir on the
 youth to an answer i think oxen and wainropes
 cannot hale them together for andrew if he were
 opened and you find so much blood in his liver as
 will clog the foot of a flea i'll eat the rest of
 the anatomy
fabian and his opposite the youth bears in his visage no
 great presage of cruelty
 enter maria
sir toby belch look where the youngest wren of nine comes
maria if you desire the spleen and will laugh yourself
 into stitches follow me yond gull malvolio is
 turned heathen a very renegado for there is no
 christian that means to be saved by believing
 rightly can ever believe such impossible passages
 of grossness he's in yellow stockings
sir toby belch and crossgartered
maria most villanously like a pedant that keeps a school
 i the church i have dogged him like his
 murderer he does obey every point of the letter
 that i dropped to betray him he does smile his
 face into more lines than is in the new map with the
 augmentation of the indies you have not seen such
 a thing as tis i can hardly forbear hurling things
 at him i know my lady will strike him if she do
 he'll smile and take't for a great favour
sir toby belch come bring us bring us where he is
 exeunt
 twelfth night
act iii
scene iii a street
 enter sebastian and antonio
sebastian i would not by my will have troubled you
 but since you make your pleasure of your pains
 i will no further chide you
antonio i could not stay behind you my desire
 more sharp than filed steel did spur me forth
 and not all love to see you though so much
 as might have drawn one to a longer voyage
 but jealousy what might befall your travel
 being skilless in these parts which to a stranger
 unguided and unfriended often prove
 rough and unhospitable my willing love
 the rather by these arguments of fear
 set forth in your pursuit
sebastian my kind antonio
