likewise i say unto you there is joy in the presence of the angels of god over one sinner that repenteth
and he said a certain man had two sons
and the younger of them said to his father father give me the portion of goods that falleth to me and he divided unto them his living
and not many days after the younger son gathered all together and took his journey into a far country and there wasted his substance with riotous living
and when he had spent all there arose a mighty famine in that land and he began to be in want
and he went and joined himself to a citizen of that country and he sent him into his fields to feed swine
and he would fain have filled his belly with the husks that the swine did eat and no man gave unto him
and when he came to himself he said how many hired servants of my father's have bread enough and to spare and i perish with hunger
i will arise and go to my father and will say unto him father i have sinned against heaven and before thee
and am no more worthy to be called thy son make me as one of thy hired servants
and he arose and came to his father but when he was yet a great way off his father saw him and had compassion and ran and fell on his neck and kissed him
and the son said unto him father i have sinned against heaven and in thy sight and am no more worthy to be called thy son
but the father said to his servants bring forth the best robe and put it on him and put a ring on his hand and shoes on his feet
and bring hither the fatted calf and kill it and let us eat and be merry
for this my son was dead and is alive again he was lost and is found and they began to be merry
now his elder son was in the field and as he came and drew nigh to the house he heard musick and dancing
and he called one of the servants and asked what these things meant
and he said unto him thy brother is come and thy father hath killed the fatted calf because he hath received him safe and sound
and he was angry and would not go in therefore came his father out and intreated him
and he answering said to his father lo these many years do i serve thee neither transgressed i at any time thy commandment and yet thou never gavest me a kid that i might make merry with my friends
but as soon as this thy son was come which hath devoured thy living with harlots thou hast killed for him the fatted calf
and he said unto him son thou art ever with me and all that i have is thine
it was meet that we should make merry and be glad for this thy brother was dead and is alive again and was lost and is found
and he said also unto his disciples there was a certain rich man which had a steward and the same was accused unto him that he had wasted his goods
and he called him and said unto him how is it that i hear this of thee give an account of thy stewardship for thou mayest be no longer steward
then the steward said within himself what shall i do for my lord taketh away from me the stewardship i cannot dig to beg i am ashamed
i am resolved what to do that when i am put out of the stewardship they may receive me into their houses
so he called every one of his lord's debtors unto him and said unto the first how much owest thou unto my lord
and he said an hundred measures of oil and he said unto him take thy bill and sit down quickly and write fifty
then said he to another and how much owest thou and he said an hundred measures of wheat and he said unto him take thy bill and write fourscore
and the lord commended the unjust steward because he had done wisely for the children of this world are in their generation wiser than the children of light
and i say unto you make to yourselves friends of the mammon of unrighteousness that when ye fail they may receive you into everlasting habitations
he that is faithful in that which is least is faithful also in much and he that is unjust in the least is unjust also in much
if therefore ye have not been faithful in the unrighteous mammon who will commit to your trust the true riches
and if ye have not been faithful in that which is another man's who shall give you that which is your own
no servant can serve two masters for either he will hate the one and love the other or else he will hold to the one and despise the other ye cannot serve god and mammon
and the pharisees also who were covetous heard all these things and they derided him
and he said unto them ye are they which justify yourselves before men but god knoweth your hearts for that which is highly esteemed among men is abomination in the sight of god
the law and the prophets were until john since that time the kingdom of god is preached and every man presseth into it
and it is easier for heaven and earth to pass than one tittle of the law to fail
whosoever putteth away his wife and marrieth another committeth adultery and whosoever marrieth her that is put away from her husband committeth adultery
there was a certain rich man which was clothed in purple and fine linen and fared sumptuously every day
and there was a certain beggar named lazarus which was laid at his gate full of sores
and desiring to be fed with the crumbs which fell from the rich man's table moreover the dogs came and licked his sores
and it came to pass that the beggar died and was carried by the angels into abraham's bosom the rich man also died and was buried
and in hell he lift up his eyes being in torments and seeth abraham afar off and lazarus in his bosom
and he cried and said father abraham have mercy on me and send lazarus that he may dip the tip of his finger in water and cool my tongue for i am tormented in this flame
but abraham said son remember that thou in thy lifetime receivedst thy good things and likewise lazarus evil things but now he is comforted and thou art tormented
and beside all this between us and you there is a great gulf fixed so that they which would pass from hence to you cannot neither can they pass to us that would come from thence
then he said i pray thee therefore father that thou wouldest send him to my father's house
for i have five brethren that he may testify unto them lest they also come into this place of torment
abraham saith unto him they have moses and the prophets let them hear them
and he said nay father abraham but if one went unto them from the dead they will repent
and he said unto him if they hear not moses and the prophets neither will they be persuaded though one rose from the dead
then said he unto the disciples it is impossible but that offences will come but woe unto him through whom they come
it were better for him that a millstone were hanged about his neck and he cast into the sea than that he should offend one of these little ones
take heed to yourselves if thy brother trespass against thee rebuke him and if he repent forgive him
and if he trespass against thee seven times in a day and seven times in a day turn again to thee saying i repent thou shalt forgive him
and the apostles said unto the lord increase our faith
and the lord said if ye had faith as a grain of mustard seed ye might say unto this sycamine tree be thou plucked up by the root and be thou planted in the sea and it should obey you
but which of you having a servant plowing or feeding cattle will say unto him by and by when he is come from the field go and sit down to meat
and will not rather say unto him make ready wherewith i may sup and gird thyself and serve me till i have eaten and drunken and afterward thou shalt eat and drink
doth he thank that servant because he did the things that were commanded him i trow not
so likewise ye when ye shall have done all those things which are commanded you say we are unprofitable servants we have done that which was our duty to do
and it came to pass as he went to jerusalem that he passed through the midst of samaria and galilee
and as he entered into a certain village there met him ten men that were lepers which stood afar off
and they lifted up their voices and said jesus master have mercy on us
and when he saw them he said unto them go shew yourselves unto the priests and it came to pass that as they went they were cleansed
and one of them when he saw that he was healed turned back and with a loud voice glorified god
and fell down on his face at his feet giving him thanks and he was a samaritan
and jesus answering said were there not ten cleansed but where are the nine
there are not found that returned to give glory to god save this stranger
and he said unto him arise go thy way thy faith hath made thee whole
and when he was demanded of the pharisees when the kingdom of god should come he answered them and said the kingdom of god cometh not with observation
neither shall they say lo here or lo there for behold the kingdom of god is within you
and he said unto the disciples the days will come when ye shall desire to see one of the days of the son of man and ye shall not see it
and they shall say to you see here or see there go not after them nor follow them
for as the lightning that lighteneth out of the one part under heaven shineth unto the other part under heaven so shall also the son of man be in his day
but first must he suffer many things and be rejected of this generation
and as it was in the days of noe so shall it be also in the days of the son of man
they did eat they drank they married wives they were given in marriage until the day that noe entered into the ark and the flood came and destroyed them all
likewise also as it was in the days of lot they did eat they drank they bought they sold they planted they builded
but the same day that lot went out of sodom it rained fire and brimstone from heaven and destroyed them all
even thus shall it be in the day when the son of man is revealed
in that day he which shall be upon the housetop and his stuff in the house let him not come down to take it away and he that is in the field let him likewise not return back
remember lot's wife
whosoever shall seek to save his life shall lose it and whosoever shall lose his life shall preserve it
i tell you in that night there shall be two men in one bed the one shall be taken and the other shall be left
two women shall be grinding together the one shall be taken and the other left
two men shall be in the field the one shall be taken and the other left
and they answered and said unto him where lord and he said unto them wheresoever the body is thither will the eagles be gathered together
and he spake a parable unto them to this end that men ought always to pray and not to faint
saying there was in a city a judge which feared not god neither regarded man
and there was a widow in that city and she came unto him saying avenge me of mine adversary
and he would not for a while but afterward he said within himself though i fear not god nor regard man
yet because this widow troubleth me i will avenge her lest by her continual coming she weary me
and the lord said hear what the unjust judge saith
and shall not god avenge his own elect which cry day and night unto him though he bear long with them
i tell you that he will avenge them speedily nevertheless when the son of man cometh shall he find faith on the earth
and he spake this parable unto certain which trusted in themselves that they were righteous and despised others
two men went up into the temple to pray the one a pharisee and the other a publican
the pharisee stood and prayed thus with himself god i thank thee that i am not as other men are extortioners unjust adulterers or even as this publican
i fast twice in the week i give tithes of all that i possess
and the publican standing afar off would not lift up so much as his eyes unto heaven but smote upon his breast saying god be merciful to me a sinner
i tell you this man went down to his house justified rather than the other for every one that exalteth himself shall be abased and he that humbleth himself shall be exalted
and they brought unto him also infants that he would touch them but when his disciples saw it they rebuked them
but jesus called them unto him and said suffer little children to come unto me and forbid them not for of such is the kingdom of god
verily i say unto you whosoever shall not receive the kingdom of god as a little child shall in no wise enter therein
and a certain ruler asked him saying good master what shall i do to inherit eternal life
and jesus said unto him why callest thou me good none is good save one that is god
thou knowest the commandments do not commit adultery do not kill do not steal do not bear false witness honour thy father and thy mother
and he said all these have i kept from my youth up
now when jesus heard these things he said unto him yet lackest thou one thing sell all that thou hast and distribute unto the poor and thou shalt have treasure in heaven and come follow me
and when he heard this he was very sorrowful for he was very rich
and when jesus saw that he was very sorrowful he said how hardly shall they that have riches enter into the kingdom of god
for it is easier for a camel to go through a needle's eye than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of god
and they that heard it said who then can be saved
and he said the things which are impossible with men are possible with god
then peter said lo we have left all and followed thee
and he said unto them verily i say unto you there is no man that hath left house or parents or brethren or wife or children for the kingdom of god's sake
who shall not receive manifold more in this present time and in the world to come life everlasting
then he took unto him the twelve and said unto them behold we go up to jerusalem and all things that are written by the prophets concerning the son of man shall be accomplished
for he shall be delivered unto the gentiles and shall be mocked and spitefully entreated and spitted on
and they shall scourge him and put him to death and the third day he shall rise again
and they understood none of these things and this saying was hid from them neither knew they the things which were spoken
and it came to pass that as he was come nigh unto jericho a certain blind man sat by the way side begging
and hearing the multitude pass by he asked what it meant
and they told him that jesus of nazareth passeth by
and he cried saying jesus thou son of david have mercy on me
and they which went before rebuked him that he should hold his peace but he cried so much the more thou son of david have mercy on me
and jesus stood and commanded him to be brought unto him and when he was come near he asked him
saying what wilt thou that i shall do unto thee and he said lord that i may receive my sight
and jesus said unto him receive thy sight thy faith hath saved thee
and immediately he received his sight and followed him glorifying god and all the people when they saw it gave praise unto god
and jesus entered and passed through jericho
and behold there was a man named zacchaeus which was the chief among the publicans and he was rich
and he sought to see jesus who he was and could not for the press because he was little of stature
and he ran before and climbed up into a sycomore tree to see him for he was to pass that way
and when jesus came to the place he looked up and saw him and said unto him zacchaeus make haste and come down for to day i must abide at thy house
and he made haste and came down and received him joyfully
and when they saw it they all murmured saying that he was gone to be guest with a man that is a sinner
and zacchaeus stood and said unto the lord behold lord the half of my goods i give to the poor and if i have taken any thing from any man by false accusation i restore him fourfold
and jesus said unto him this day is salvation come to this house forsomuch as he also is a son of abraham
for the son of man is come to seek and to save that which was lost
and as they heard these things he added and spake a parable because he was nigh to jerusalem and because they thought that the kingdom of god should immediately appear
he said therefore a certain nobleman went into a far country to receive for himself a kingdom and to return
and he called his ten servants and delivered them ten pounds and said unto them occupy till i come
but his citizens hated him and sent a message after him saying we will not have this man to reign over us
and it came to pass that when he was returned having received the kingdom then he commanded these servants to be called unto him to whom he had given the money that he might know how much every man had gained by trading
then came the first saying lord thy pound hath gained ten pounds
and he said unto him well thou good servant because thou hast been faithful in a very little have thou authority over ten cities
and the second came saying lord thy pound hath gained five pounds
and he said likewise to him be thou also over five cities
and another came saying lord behold here is thy pound which i have kept laid up in a napkin
for i feared thee because thou art an austere man thou takest up that thou layedst not down and reapest that thou didst not sow
and he saith unto him out of thine own mouth will i judge thee thou wicked servant thou knewest that i was an austere man taking up that i laid not down and reaping that i did not sow
wherefore then gavest not thou my money into the bank that at my coming i might have required mine own with usury
and he said unto them that stood by take from him the pound and give it to him that hath ten pounds
and they said unto him lord he hath ten pounds
for i say unto you that unto every one which hath shall be given and from him that hath not even that he hath shall be taken away from him
but those mine enemies which would not that i should reign over them bring hither and slay them before me
and when he had thus spoken he went before ascending up to jerusalem
and it came to pass when he was come nigh to bethphage and bethany at the mount called the mount of olives he sent two of his disciples
saying go ye into the village over against you in the which at your entering ye shall find a colt tied whereon yet never man sat loose him and bring him hither
and if any man ask you why do ye loose him thus shall ye say unto him because the lord hath need of him
and they that were sent went their way and found even as he had said unto them
and as they were loosing the colt the owners thereof said unto them why loose ye the colt
and they said the lord hath need of him
and they brought him to jesus and they cast their garments upon the colt and they set jesus thereon
and as he went they spread their clothes in the way
and when he was come nigh even now at the descent of the mount of olives the whole multitude of the disciples began to rejoice and praise god with a loud voice for all the mighty works that they had seen
saying blessed be the king that cometh in the name of the lord peace in heaven and glory in the highest
and some of the pharisees from among the multitude said unto him master rebuke thy disciples
and he answered and said unto them i tell you that if these should hold their peace the stones would immediately cry out
and when he was come near he beheld the city and wept over it
saying if thou hadst known even thou at least in this thy day the things which belong unto thy peace but now they are hid from thine eyes
for the days shall come upon thee that thine enemies shall cast a trench about thee and compass thee round and keep thee in on every side
and shall lay thee even with the ground and thy children within thee and they shall not leave in thee one stone upon another because thou knewest not the time of thy visitation
and he went into the temple and began to cast out them that sold therein and them that bought
saying unto them it is written my house is the house of prayer but ye have made it a den of thieves
and he taught daily in the temple but the chief priests and the scribes and the chief of the people sought to destroy him
and could not find what they might do for all the people were very attentive to hear him
and it came to pass that on one of those days as he taught the people in the temple and preached the gospel the chief priests and the scribes came upon him with the elders
and spake unto him saying tell us by what authority doest thou these things or who is he that gave thee this authority
and he answered and said unto them i will also ask you one thing and answer me
the baptism of john was it from heaven or of men
and they reasoned with themselves saying if we shall say from heaven he will say why then believed ye him not
but and if we say of men all the people will stone us for they be persuaded that john was a prophet
and they answered that they could not tell whence it was
and jesus said unto them neither tell i you by what authority i do these things
then began he to speak to the people this parable a certain man planted a vineyard and let it forth to husbandmen and went into a far country for a long time
and at the season he sent a servant to the husbandmen that they should give him of the fruit of the vineyard but the husbandmen beat him and sent him away empty
and again he sent another servant and they beat him also and entreated him shamefully and sent him away empty
and again he sent a third and they wounded him also and cast him out
then said the lord of the vineyard what shall i do i will send my beloved son it may be they will reverence him when they see him
but when the husbandmen saw him they reasoned among themselves saying this is the heir come let us kill him that the inheritance may be ours
so they cast him out of the vineyard and killed him what therefore shall the lord of the vineyard do unto them
he shall come and destroy these husbandmen and shall give the vineyard to others and when they heard it they said god forbid
and he beheld them and said what is this then that is written the stone which the builders rejected the same is become the head of the corner
whosoever shall fall upon that stone shall be broken but on whomsoever it shall fall it will grind him to powder
