 staves and strong ones these are but switches to
 em i'll scratch your heads you must be seeing
 christenings do you look for ale and cakes here

 to scatter em as tis to make em sleep
 on mayday morning which will never be
 we may as well push against powle's as stir em

 to mow em down before me but if i spared any
 that had a head to hit either young or old

 dozens is this moorfields to muster in or have
 we some strange indian with the great tool come to
 court the women so besiege us bless me what a
 fry of fornication is at door on my christian
 conscience this one christening will beget a
 thousand here will be father godfather and all together
man the spoons will be the bigger sir there is a
 fellow somewhat near the door he should be a
 brazier by his face for o my conscience twenty
 of the dogdays now reign in's nose all that stand
 about him are under the line they need no other
 penance that firedrake did i hit three times on
 the head and three times was his nose discharged
 against me he stands there like a mortarpiece to
 blow us there was a haberdasher's wife of small
 wit near him that railed upon me till her pinked
 porringer fell off her head for kindling such a
 combustion in the state i missed the meteor once
 and hit that woman who cried out clubs when i
 might see from far some forty truncheoners draw to
 her succor which were the hope o the strand where
 she was quartered they fell on i made good my
 place at length they came to the broomstaff to
 me i defied em still when suddenly a file of
 boys behind em loose shot delivered such a shower
 of pebbles that i was fain to draw mine honour in
 and let em win the work the devil was amongst
 em i think surely
porter these are the youths that thunder at a playhouse
 and fight for bitten apples that no audience but
 the tribulation of towerhill or the limbs of
 limehouse their dear brothers are able to endure
 i have some of em in limbo patrum and there they
 are like to dance these three days besides the
 running banquet of two beadles that is to come
 enter chamberlain
chamberlain mercy o me what a multitude are here
 they grow still too from all parts they are coming
 as if we kept a fair here where are these porters
 these lazy knaves ye have made a fine hand fellows
 there's a trim rabble let in are all these
 your faithful friends o the suburbs we shall have
 great store of room no doubt left for the ladies
 when they pass back from the christening
porter an't please
 your honour
 we are but men and what so many may do
 not being torn apieces we have done
 an army cannot rule em
chamberlain as i live
 if the king blame me for't i'll lay ye all
 by the heels and suddenly and on your heads
 clap round fines for neglect ye are lazy knaves
 and here ye lie baiting of bombards when
 ye should do service hark the trumpets sound
 they're come already from the christening
 go break among the press and find a way out
 to let the troop pass fairly or i'll find
 a marshalsea shall hold ye play these two months
porter make way there for the princess
man you great fellow
 stand close up or i'll make your head ache
porter you i the camlet get up o the rail
 i'll peck you o'er the pales else

cranmer let me speak sir
 for heaven now bids me and the words i utter
 let none think flattery for they'll find em truth
 this royal infantheaven still move about her
 though in her cradle yet now promises
 upon this land a thousand thousand blessings
 which time shall bring to ripeness she shall be
 but few now living can behold that goodness
 a pattern to all princes living with her
 and all that shall succeed saba was never
 more covetous of wisdom and fair virtue
 than this pure soul shall be all princely graces
 that mould up such a mighty piece as this is
 with all the virtues that attend the good

 holy and heavenly thoughts still counsel her
 she shall be loved and fear'd her own shall bless her
 her foes shake like a field of beaten corn
 and hang their heads with sorrow good grows with her
 in her days every man shall eat in safety
 under his own vine what he plants and sing
 the merry songs of peace to all his neighbours
 god shall be truly known and those about her
 from her shall read the perfect ways of honour
 and by those claim their greatness not by blood
 nor shall this peace sleep with her but as when
 the bird of wonder dies the maiden phoenix
 her ashes new create another heir
 as great in admiration as herself
 so shall she leave her blessedness to one
 when heaven shall call her from this cloud of darkness
 who from the sacred ashes of her honour
 shall starlike rise as great in fame as she was
 and so stand fix'd peace plenty love truth terror
 that were the servants to this chosen infant
 shall then be his and like a vine grow to him
 wherever the bright sun of heaven shall shine
 his honour and the greatness of his name
 shall be and make new nations he shall flourish
 and like a mountain cedar reach his branches
 to all the plains about him our children's children
 shall see this and bless heaven
king henry viii thou speakest wonders
cranmer she shall be to the happiness of england
 an aged princess many days shall see her
 and yet no day without a deed to crown it
 would i had known no more but she must die
 she must the saints must have her yet a virgin
 a most unspotted lily shall she pass
 to the ground and all the world shall mourn her
king henry viii o lord archbishop
