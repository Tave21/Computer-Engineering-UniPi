 when majesty stoops to folly reverse thy doom
 and in thy best consideration cheque
 this hideous rashness answer my life my judgment
 thy youngest daughter does not love thee least
 nor are those emptyhearted whose low sound
 reverbs no hollowness
king lear kent on thy life no more
kent my life i never held but as a pawn
 to wage against thy enemies nor fear to lose it
 thy safety being the motive
king lear out of my sight
kent see better lear and let me still remain
 the true blank of thine eye
king lear now by apollo
kent now by apollo king
 thou swear'st thy gods in vain
king lear o vassal miscreant
 laying his hand on his sword
albany 
 dear sir forbear
cornwall 
kent do
 kill thy physician and the fee bestow
 upon thy foul disease revoke thy doom
 or whilst i can vent clamour from my throat
 i'll tell thee thou dost evil
king lear hear me recreant
 on thine allegiance hear me
 since thou hast sought to make us break our vow
 which we durst never yet and with strain'd pride
 to come between our sentence and our power
 which nor our nature nor our place can bear
 our potency made good take thy reward
 five days we do allot thee for provision
 to shield thee from diseases of the world
 and on the sixth to turn thy hated back
 upon our kingdom if on the tenth day following
 thy banish'd trunk be found in our dominions
 the moment is thy death away by jupiter
 this shall not be revoked
kent fare thee well king sith thus thou wilt appear
 freedom lives hence and banishment is here
 to cordelia
 the gods to their dear shelter take thee maid
 that justly think'st and hast most rightly said
 to regan and goneril
 and your large speeches may your deeds approve
 that good effects may spring from words of love
 thus kent o princes bids you all adieu
 he'll shape his old course in a country new
 exit
 flourish reenter gloucester with king of france
 burgundy and attendants
gloucester here's france and burgundy my noble lord
king lear my lord of burgundy
 we first address towards you who with this king
 hath rivall'd for our daughter what in the least
 will you require in present dower with her
 or cease your quest of love
burgundy most royal majesty
 i crave no more than what your highness offer'd
 nor will you tender less
king lear right noble burgundy
 when she was dear to us we did hold her so
 but now her price is fall'n sir there she stands
 if aught within that little seeming substance
 or all of it with our displeasure pieced
 and nothing more may fitly like your grace
 she's there and she is yours
burgundy i know no answer
king lear will you with those infirmities she owes
 unfriended newadopted to our hate
 dower'd with our curse and stranger'd with our oath
 take her or leave her
burgundy pardon me royal sir
 election makes not up on such conditions
king lear then leave her sir for by the power that made me
 i tell you all her wealth
 to king of france
 for you great king
 i would not from your love make such a stray
 to match you where i hate therefore beseech you
 to avert your liking a more worthier way
 than on a wretch whom nature is ashamed
 almost to acknowledge hers
king of france this is most strange
 that she that even but now was your best object
 the argument of your praise balm of your age
 most best most dearest should in this trice of time
 commit a thing so monstrous to dismantle
 so many folds of favour sure her offence
 must be of such unnatural degree
 that monsters it or your forevouch'd affection
 fall'n into taint which to believe of her
 must be a faith that reason without miracle
 could never plant in me
cordelia i yet beseech your majesty
 if for i want that glib and oily art
 to speak and purpose not since what i well intend
 i'll do't before i speakthat you make known
 it is no vicious blot murder or foulness
 no unchaste action or dishonour'd step
 that hath deprived me of your grace and favour
 but even for want of that for which i am richer
 a stillsoliciting eye and such a tongue
 as i am glad i have not though not to have it
 hath lost me in your liking
king lear better thou
 hadst not been born than not to have pleased me better
king of france is it but thisa tardiness in nature
 which often leaves the history unspoke
 that it intends to do my lord of burgundy
 what say you to the lady love's not love
 when it is mingled with regards that stand
 aloof from the entire point will you have her
 she is herself a dowry
burgundy royal lear
 give but that portion which yourself proposed
 and here i take cordelia by the hand
 duchess of burgundy
king lear nothing i have sworn i am firm
burgundy i am sorry then you have so lost a father
 that you must lose a husband
cordelia peace be with burgundy
 since that respects of fortune are his love
 i shall not be his wife
king of france fairest cordelia that art most rich being poor
 most choice forsaken and most loved despised
 thee and thy virtues here i seize upon
 be it lawful i take up what's cast away
 gods gods tis strange that from their cold'st neglect
 my love should kindle to inflamed respect
 thy dowerless daughter king thrown to my chance
 is queen of us of ours and our fair france
 not all the dukes of waterish burgundy
 can buy this unprized precious maid of me
 bid them farewell cordelia though unkind
 thou losest here a better where to find
king lear thou hast her france let her be thine for we
 have no such daughter nor shall ever see
 that face of hers again therefore be gone
 without our grace our love our benison
 come noble burgundy
 flourish exeunt all but king of france goneril
 regan and cordelia
king of france bid farewell to your sisters
cordelia the jewels of our father with wash'd eyes
 cordelia leaves you i know you what you are
 and like a sister am most loath to call
 your faults as they are named use well our father
 to your professed bosoms i commit him
 but yet alas stood i within his grace
 i would prefer him to a better place
 so farewell to you both
regan prescribe not us our duties
goneril let your study
 be to content your lord who hath received you
 at fortune's alms you have obedience scanted
 and well are worth the want that you have wanted
cordelia time shall unfold what plaited cunning hides
 who cover faults at last shame them derides
 well may you prosper
king of france come my fair cordelia
 exeunt king of france and cordelia
goneril sister it is not a little i have to say of what
 most nearly appertains to us both i think our
 father will hence tonight
regan that's most certain and with you next month with us
goneril you see how full of changes his age is the
 observation we have made of it hath not been
 little he always loved our sister most and
 with what poor judgment he hath now cast her off
 appears too grossly
regan tis the infirmity of his age yet he hath ever
 but slenderly known himself
goneril the best and soundest of his time hath been but
 rash then must we look to receive from his age
 not alone the imperfections of longengraffed
 condition but therewithal the unruly waywardness
 that infirm and choleric years bring with them
regan such unconstant starts are we like to have from
 him as this of kent's banishment
goneril there is further compliment of leavetaking
 between france and him pray you let's hit
 together if our father carry authority with
 such dispositions as he bears this last
 surrender of his will but offend us
regan we shall further think on't
goneril we must do something and i the heat
