 win you this city without stroke or wound
 rescue those breathing lives to die in beds
 that here come sacrifices for the field
 persever not but hear me mighty kings
king john speak on with favour we are bent to hear
first citizen that daughter there of spain the lady blanch
 is niece to england look upon the years
 of lewis the dauphin and that lovely maid
 if lusty love should go in quest of beauty
 where should he find it fairer than in blanch
 if zealous love should go in search of virtue
 where should he find it purer than in blanch
 if love ambitious sought a match of birth
 whose veins bound richer blood than lady blanch
 such as she is in beauty virtue birth
 is the young dauphin every way complete
 if not complete of say he is not she
 and she again wants nothing to name want
 if want it be not that she is not he
 he is the half part of a blessed man
 left to be finished by such as she
 and she a fair divided excellence
 whose fulness of perfection lies in him
 o two such silver currents when they join
 do glorify the banks that bound them in
 and two such shores to two such streams made one
 two such controlling bounds shall you be kings
 to these two princes if you marry them
 this union shall do more than battery can
 to our fastclosed gates for at this match
 with swifter spleen than powder can enforce
 the mouth of passage shall we fling wide ope
 and give you entrance but without this match
 the sea enraged is not half so deaf
 lions more confident mountains and rocks
 more free from motion no not death himself
 in moral fury half so peremptory
 as we to keep this city
bastard here's a stay
 that shakes the rotten carcass of old death
 out of his rags here's a large mouth indeed
 that spits forth death and mountains rocks and seas
 talks as familiarly of roaring lions
 as maids of thirteen do of puppydogs
 what cannoneer begot this lusty blood
 he speaks plain cannon fire and smoke and bounce
 he gives the bastinado with his tongue
 our ears are cudgell'd not a word of his
 but buffets better than a fist of france
 zounds i was never so bethump'd with words
 since i first call'd my brother's father dad
queen elinor son list to this conjunction make this match
 give with our niece a dowry large enough
 for by this knot thou shalt so surely tie
 thy now unsured assurance to the crown
 that yon green boy shall have no sun to ripe
 the bloom that promiseth a mighty fruit
 i see a yielding in the looks of france
 mark how they whisper urge them while their souls
 are capable of this ambition
 lest zeal now melted by the windy breath
 of soft petitions pity and remorse
 cool and congeal again to what it was
first citizen why answer not the double majesties
 this friendly treaty of our threaten'd town
king philip speak england first that hath been forward first
 to speak unto this city what say you
king john if that the dauphin there thy princely son
 can in this book of beauty read i love'
 her dowry shall weigh equal with a queen
 for anjou and fair touraine maine poictiers
 and all that we upon this side the sea
 except this city now by us besieged
 find liable to our crown and dignity
 shall gild her bridal bed and make her rich
 in titles honours and promotions
 as she in beauty education blood
 holds hand with any princess of the world
king philip what say'st thou boy look in the lady's face
lewis i do my lord and in her eye i find
 a wonder or a wondrous miracle
 the shadow of myself form'd in her eye
 which being but the shadow of your son
 becomes a sun and makes your son a shadow
 i do protest i never loved myself
 till now infixed i beheld myself
 drawn in the flattering table of her eye
 whispers with blanch
bastard drawn in the flattering table of her eye
 hang'd in the frowning wrinkle of her brow
 and quarter'd in her heart he doth espy
 himself love's traitor this is pity now
 that hang'd and drawn and quartered there should be
 in such a love so vile a lout as he
blanch my uncle's will in this respect is mine
 if he see aught in you that makes him like
 that any thing he sees which moves his liking
 i can with ease translate it to my will
 or if you will to speak more properly
 i will enforce it easily to my love
 further i will not flatter you my lord
 that all i see in you is worthy love
 than this that nothing do i see in you
 though churlish thoughts themselves should be your judge
 that i can find should merit any hate
king john what say these young ones what say you my niece
blanch that she is bound in honour still to do
 what you in wisdom still vouchsafe to say
king john speak then prince dauphin can you love this lady
lewis nay ask me if i can refrain from love
 for i do love her most unfeignedly
king john then do i give volquessen touraine maine
 poictiers and anjou these five provinces
 with her to thee and this addition more
 full thirty thousand marks of english coin
 philip of france if thou be pleased withal
 command thy son and daughter to join hands
king philip it likes us well young princes close your hands
austria and your lips too for i am well assured
 that i did so when i was first assured
king philip now citizens of angiers ope your gates
 let in that amity which you have made
 for at saint mary's chapel presently
 the rites of marriage shall be solemnized
 is not the lady constance in this troop
 i know she is not for this match made up
 her presence would have interrupted much
 where is she and her son tell me who knows
lewis she is sad and passionate at your highness tent
king philip and by my faith this league that we have made
 will give her sadness very little cure
 brother of england how may we content
 this widow lady in her right we came
 which we god knows have turn'd another way
 to our own vantage
king john we will heal up all
 for we'll create young arthur duke of bretagne
 and earl of richmond and this rich fair town
 we make him lord of call the lady constance
 some speedy messenger bid her repair
 to our solemnity i trust we shall
 if not fill up the measure of her will
 yet in some measure satisfy her so
 that we shall stop her exclamation
 go we as well as haste will suffer us
 to this unlook'd for unprepared pomp
 exeunt all but the bastard
bastard mad world mad kings mad composition
 john to stop arthur's title in the whole
 hath willingly departed with a part
 and france whose armour conscience buckled on
 whom zeal and charity brought to the field
 as god's own soldier rounded in the ear
 with that same purposechanger that sly devil
 that broker that still breaks the pate of faith
 that daily breakvow he that wins of all
 of kings of beggars old men young men maids
 who having no external thing to lose
 but the word maid cheats the poor maid of that
 that smoothfaced gentleman tickling commodity
 commodity the bias of the world
 the world who of itself is peised well
 made to run even upon even ground
 till this advantage this viledrawing bias
 this sway of motion this commodity
 makes it take head from all indifferency
 from all direction purpose course intent
 and this same bias this commodity
 this bawd this broker this allchanging word
 clapp'd on the outward eye of fickle france
 hath drawn him from his own determined aid
 from a resolved and honourable war
 to a most base and vileconcluded peace
 and why rail i on this commodity
 but for because he hath not woo'd me yet
 not that i have the power to clutch my hand
 when his fair angels would salute my palm
 but for my hand as unattempted yet
 like a poor beggar raileth on the rich
 well whiles i am a beggar i will rail
 and say there is no sin but to be rich
 and being rich my virtue then shall be
 to say there is no vice but beggary
 since kings break faith upon commodity
 gain be my lord for i will worship thee
 exit
 king john
act iii
scene i the french king's pavilion
 enter constance arthur and salisbury
constance gone to be married gone to swear a peace
 false blood to false blood join'd gone to be friends
 shall lewis have blanch and blanch those provinces
 it is not so thou hast misspoke misheard
 be well advised tell o'er thy tale again
 it cannot be thou dost but say tis so
 i trust i may not trust thee for thy word
 is but the vain breath of a common man
 believe me i do not believe thee man
 i have a king's oath to the contrary
