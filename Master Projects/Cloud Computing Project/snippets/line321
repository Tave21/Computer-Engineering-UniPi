 whose mouth is cover'd with rudegrowing briers
 upon whose leaves are drops of newshed blood
 as fresh as morning dew distill'd on flowers
 a very fatal place it seems to me
 speak brother hast thou hurt thee with the fall
martius o brother with the dismall'st object hurt
 that ever eye with sight made heart lament
aaron aside now will i fetch the king to find them here
 that he thereby may give a likely guess
 how these were they that made away his brother
 exit
martius why dost not comfort me and help me out
 from this unhallowed and bloodstained hole
quintus i am surprised with an uncouth fear
 a chilling sweat o'erruns my trembling joints
 my heart suspects more than mine eye can see
martius to prove thou hast a truedivining heart
 aaron and thou look down into this den
 and see a fearful sight of blood and death
quintus aaron is gone and my compassionate heart
 will not permit mine eyes once to behold
 the thing whereat it trembles by surmise
 o tell me how it is for ne'er till now
 was i a child to fear i know not what
martius lord bassianus lies embrewed here
 all on a heap like to a slaughter'd lamb
 in this detested dark blooddrinking pit
quintus if it be dark how dost thou know tis he
martius upon his bloody finger he doth wear
 a precious ring that lightens all the hole
 which like a taper in some monument
 doth shine upon the dead man's earthy cheeks
 and shows the ragged entrails of the pit
 so pale did shine the moon on pyramus
 when he by night lay bathed in maiden blood
 o brother help me with thy fainting hand
 if fear hath made thee faint as me it hath
 out of this fell devouring receptacle
 as hateful as cocytus misty mouth
quintus reach me thy hand that i may help thee out
 or wanting strength to do thee so much good
 i may be pluck'd into the swallowing womb
 of this deep pit poor bassianus grave
 i have no strength to pluck thee to the brink
martius nor i no strength to climb without thy help
quintus thy hand once more i will not loose again
 till thou art here aloft or i below
 thou canst not come to me i come to thee
 falls in
 enter saturninus with aaron
saturninus along with me i'll see what hole is here
 and what he is that now is leap'd into it
 say who art thou that lately didst descend
 into this gaping hollow of the earth
martius the unhappy son of old andronicus
 brought hither in a most unlucky hour
 to find thy brother bassianus dead
saturninus my brother dead i know thou dost but jest
 he and his lady both are at the lodge
 upon the north side of this pleasant chase
 tis not an hour since i left him there
martius we know not where you left him all alive
 but out alas here have we found him dead
 reenter tamora with attendants titus
 andronicus and lucius
tamora where is my lord the king
saturninus here tamora though grieved with killing grief
tamora where is thy brother bassianus
saturninus now to the bottom dost thou search my wound
 poor bassianus here lies murdered
tamora then all too late i bring this fatal writ
 the complot of this timeless tragedy
 and wonder greatly that man's face can fold
 in pleasing smiles such murderous tyranny
 she giveth saturninus a letter
saturninus reads an if we miss to meet him handsomely
 sweet huntsman bassianus tis we mean
 do thou so much as dig the grave for him
 thou know'st our meaning look for thy reward
 among the nettles at the eldertree
 which overshades the mouth of that same pit
 where we decreed to bury bassianus
 do this and purchase us thy lasting friends'
 o tamora was ever heard the like
 this is the pit and this the eldertree
 look sirs if you can find the huntsman out
 that should have murdered bassianus here
aaron my gracious lord here is the bag of gold
saturninus to titus two of thy whelps fell curs of
 bloody kind
 have here bereft my brother of his life
 sirs drag them from the pit unto the prison
 there let them bide until we have devised
 some neverheardof torturing pain for them
tamora what are they in this pit o wondrous thing
 how easily murder is discovered
titus andronicus high emperor upon my feeble knee
 i beg this boon with tears not lightly shed
 that this fell fault of my accursed sons
 accursed if the fault be proved in them
saturninus if it be proved you see it is apparent
 who found this letter tamora was it you
tamora andronicus himself did take it up
titus andronicus i did my lord yet let me be their bail
 for by my father's reverend tomb i vow
 they shall be ready at your highness will
 to answer their suspicion with their lives
saturninus thou shalt not bail them see thou follow me
 some bring the murder'd body some the murderers
 let them not speak a word the guilt is plain
 for by my soul were there worse end than death
 that end upon them should be executed
tamora andronicus i will entreat the king
 fear not thy sons they shall do well enough
titus andronicus come lucius come stay not to talk with them

scene iv another part of the forest
 enter demetrius and chiron with lavinia ravished
 her hands cut off and her tongue cut out
demetrius so now go tell an if thy tongue can speak
 who twas that cut thy tongue and ravish'd thee
chiron write down thy mind bewray thy meaning so
 an if thy stumps will let thee play the scribe
demetrius see how with signs and tokens she can scrowl
chiron go home call for sweet water wash thy hands
demetrius she hath no tongue to call nor hands to wash
 and so let's leave her to her silent walks
chiron an twere my case i should go hang myself
demetrius if thou hadst hands to help thee knit the cord
 exeunt demetrius and chiron
 enter marcus
marcus who is this my niece that flies away so fast
 cousin a word where is your husband
 if i do dream would all my wealth would wake me
 if i do wake some planet strike me down
 that i may slumber in eternal sleep
 speak gentle niece what stern ungentle hands
 have lopp'd and hew'd and made thy body bare
 of her two branches those sweet ornaments
 whose circling shadows kings have sought to sleep in
 and might not gain so great a happiness
 as have thy love why dost not speak to me
 alas a crimson river of warm blood
 like to a bubbling fountain stirr'd with wind
 doth rise and fall between thy rosed lips
 coming and going with thy honey breath
 but sure some tereus hath deflowered thee
 and lest thou shouldst detect him cut thy tongue
 ah now thou turn'st away thy face for shame
 and notwithstanding all this loss of blood
 as from a conduit with three issuing spouts
 yet do thy cheeks look red as titan's face
 blushing to be encountered with a cloud
 shall i speak for thee shall i say tis so
 o that i knew thy heart and knew the beast
 that i might rail at him to ease my mind
 sorrow concealed like an oven stopp'd
 doth burn the heart to cinders where it is
 fair philomela she but lost her tongue
 and in a tedious sampler sew'd her mind
 but lovely niece that mean is cut from thee
 a craftier tereus cousin hast thou met
 and he hath cut those pretty fingers off
 that could have better sew'd than philomel
 o had the monster seen those lily hands
 tremble like aspenleaves upon a lute
 and make the silken strings delight to kiss them
 he would not then have touch'd them for his life
 or had he heard the heavenly harmony
 which that sweet tongue hath made
 he would have dropp'd his knife and fell asleep
 as cerberus at the thracian poet's feet
 come let us go and make thy father blind
 for such a sight will blind a father's eye
 one hour's storm will drown the fragrant meads
 what will whole months of tears thy father's eyes
 do not draw back for we will mourn with thee
 o could our mourning ease thy misery

act iii
scene i rome a street
 enter judges senators and tribunes with martius
 and quintus bound passing on to the place of
 execution titus going before pleading
titus andronicus hear me grave fathers noble tribunes stay
 for pity of mine age whose youth was spent
 in dangerous wars whilst you securely slept
 for all my blood in rome's great quarrel shed
 for all the frosty nights that i have watch'd
 and for these bitter tears which now you see
 filling the aged wrinkles in my cheeks
 be pitiful to my condemned sons
 whose souls are not corrupted as tis thought
 for two and twenty sons i never wept
 because they died in honour's lofty bed
 lieth down the judges &c pass by him and exeunt
 for these these tribunes in the dust i write
