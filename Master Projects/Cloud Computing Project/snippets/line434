boyet why that contempt will kill the speaker's heart
 and quite divorce his memory from his part
princess therefore i do it and i make no doubt
 the rest will ne'er come in if he be out
 there's no such sport as sport by sport o'erthrown
 to make theirs ours and ours none but our own
 so shall we stay mocking intended game
 and they well mock'd depart away with shame
 trumpets sound within
boyet the trumpet sounds be mask'd the maskers come
 the ladies mask
 enter blackamoors with music moth ferdinand
 biron longaville and dumain in russian habits
 and masked
moth all hail the richest beauties on the earth
boyet beauties no richer than rich taffeta
moth a holy parcel of the fairest dames
 the ladies turn their backs to him
 that ever turn'd theirbacksto mortal views
biron aside to moth their eyes villain their eyes
moth that ever turn'd their eyes to mortal viewsout
boyet true out indeed
moth out of your favours heavenly spirits vouchsafe
 not to behold
biron aside to moth once to behold rogue
moth once to behold with your sunbeamed eyes
 with your sunbeamed eyes
boyet they will not answer to that epithet
 you were best call it daughterbeamed eyes'
moth they do not mark me and that brings me out
biron is this your perfectness be gone you rogue
 exit moth
rosaline what would these strangers know their minds boyet
 if they do speak our language tis our will
 that some plain man recount their purposes
 know what they would
boyet what would you with the princess
biron nothing but peace and gentle visitation
rosaline what would they say they
boyet nothing but peace and gentle visitation
rosaline why that they have and bid them so be gone
boyet she says you have it and you may be gone
ferdinand say to her we have measured many miles
 to tread a measure with her on this grass
boyet they say that they have measured many a mile
 to tread a measure with you on this grass
rosaline it is not so ask them how many inches
 is in one mile if they have measured many
 the measure then of one is easily told
boyet if to come hither you have measured miles
 and many miles the princess bids you tell
 how many inches doth fill up one mile
biron tell her we measure them by weary steps
boyet she hears herself
rosaline how many weary steps
 of many weary miles you have o'ergone
 are number'd in the travel of one mile
biron we number nothing that we spend for you
 our duty is so rich so infinite
 that we may do it still without accompt
 vouchsafe to show the sunshine of your face
 that we like savages may worship it
rosaline my face is but a moon and clouded too
ferdinand blessed are clouds to do as such clouds do
 vouchsafe bright moon and these thy stars to shine
 those clouds removed upon our watery eyne
rosaline o vain petitioner beg a greater matter
 thou now request'st but moonshine in the water
ferdinand then in our measure do but vouchsafe one change
 thou bid'st me beg this begging is not strange
rosaline play music then nay you must do it soon
 music plays
 not yet no dance thus change i like the moon
ferdinand will you not dance how come you thus estranged
rosaline you took the moon at full but now she's changed
ferdinand yet still she is the moon and i the man
 the music plays vouchsafe some motion to it
rosaline our ears vouchsafe it
ferdinand but your legs should do it
rosaline since you are strangers and come here by chance
 we'll not be nice take hands we will not dance
ferdinand why take we hands then
rosaline only to part friends
 curtsy sweet hearts and so the measure ends
ferdinand more measure of this measure be not nice
rosaline we can afford no more at such a price
ferdinand prize you yourselves what buys your company
rosaline your absence only
ferdinand that can never be
rosaline then cannot we be bought and so adieu
 twice to your visor and half once to you
ferdinand if you deny to dance let's hold more chat
rosaline in private then
ferdinand i am best pleased with that
 they converse apart
biron whitehanded mistress one sweet word with thee
princess honey and milk and sugar there is three
biron nay then two treys and if you grow so nice
 metheglin wort and malmsey well run dice
 there's halfadozen sweets
princess seventh sweet adieu
 since you can cog i'll play no more with you
biron one word in secret
princess let it not be sweet
biron thou grievest my gall
princess gall bitter
biron therefore meet
 they converse apart
dumain will you vouchsafe with me to change a word
maria name it
dumain fair lady
maria say you so fair lord
 take that for your fair lady
dumain please it you
 as much in private and i'll bid adieu
 they converse apart
katharine what was your vizard made without a tongue
longaville i know the reason lady why you ask
katharine o for your reason quickly sir i long
longaville you have a double tongue within your mask
 and would afford my speechless vizard half
katharine veal quoth the dutchman is not veal a calf
longaville a calf fair lady
katharine no a fair lord calf
longaville let's part the word
katharine no i'll not be your half
 take all and wean it it may prove an ox
longaville look how you butt yourself in these sharp mocks
 will you give horns chaste lady do not so
katharine then die a calf before your horns do grow
longaville one word in private with you ere i die
katharine bleat softly then the butcher hears you cry
 they converse apart
boyet the tongues of mocking wenches are as keen
 as is the razor's edge invisible
 cutting a smaller hair than may be seen
 above the sense of sense so sensible
 seemeth their conference their conceits have wings
 fleeter than arrows bullets wind thought swifter things
rosaline not one word more my maids break off break off
biron by heaven all drybeaten with pure scoff
ferdinand farewell mad wenches you have simple wits
princess twenty adieus my frozen muscovits
 exeunt ferdinand lords and blackamoors
 are these the breed of wits so wonder'd at
boyet tapers they are with your sweet breaths puff'd out
rosaline wellliking wits they have gross gross fat fat
princess o poverty in wit kinglypoor flout
 will they not think you hang themselves tonight
 or ever but in vizards show their faces
 this pert biron was out of countenance quite
rosaline o they were all in lamentable cases
 the king was weepingripe for a good word
princess biron did swear himself out of all suit
maria dumain was at my service and his sword
 no point quoth i my servant straight was mute
katharine lord longaville said i came o'er his heart
 and trow you what he called me
princess qualm perhaps
katharine yes in good faith
princess go sickness as thou art
rosaline well better wits have worn plain statutecaps
 but will you hear the king is my love sworn
princess and quick biron hath plighted faith to me
katharine and longaville was for my service born
maria dumain is mine as sure as bark on tree
boyet madam and pretty mistresses give ear
 immediately they will again be here
 in their own shapes for it can never be
 they will digest this harsh indignity
princess will they return
boyet they will they will god knows
 and leap for joy though they are lame with blows
 therefore change favours and when they repair
 blow like sweet roses in this summer air
princess how blow how blow speak to be understood
boyet fair ladies mask'd are roses in their bud
 dismask'd their damask sweet commixture shown
 are angels vailing clouds or roses blown
princess avaunt perplexity what shall we do
 if they return in their own shapes to woo
rosaline good madam if by me you'll be advised
 let's mock them still as well known as disguised
 let us complain to them what fools were here
 disguised like muscovites in shapeless gear
 and wonder what they were and to what end
 their shallow shows and prologue vilely penn'd
 and their rough carriage so ridiculous
 should be presented at our tent to us
boyet ladies withdraw the gallants are at hand
princess whip to our tents as roes run o'er land
 exeunt princess rosaline katharine and maria
 reenter ferdinand biron longaville and dumain
 in their proper habits
ferdinand fair sir god save you where's the princess
boyet gone to her tent please it your majesty
 command me any service to her thither
ferdinand that she vouchsafe me audience for one word
boyet i will and so will she i know my lord
 exit
