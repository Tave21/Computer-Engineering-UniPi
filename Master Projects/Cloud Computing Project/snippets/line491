 see'st thou this sweet sight
 her dotage now i do begin to pity
 for meeting her of late behind the wood
 seeking sweet favours from this hateful fool
 i did upbraid her and fall out with her
 for she his hairy temples then had rounded
 with a coronet of fresh and fragrant flowers
 and that same dew which sometime on the buds
 was wont to swell like round and orient pearls
 stood now within the pretty flowerets eyes
 like tears that did their own disgrace bewail
 when i had at my pleasure taunted her
 and she in mild terms begg'd my patience
 i then did ask of her her changeling child
 which straight she gave me and her fairy sent
 to bear him to my bower in fairy land
 and now i have the boy i will undo
 this hateful imperfection of her eyes
 and gentle puck take this transformed scalp
 from off the head of this athenian swain
 that he awaking when the other do
 may all to athens back again repair
 and think no more of this night's accidents
 but as the fierce vexation of a dream
 but first i will release the fairy queen
 be as thou wast wont to be
 see as thou wast wont to see
 dian's bud o'er cupid's flower
 hath such force and blessed power
 now my titania wake you my sweet queen
titania my oberon what visions have i seen
 methought i was enamour'd of an ass
oberon there lies your love
titania how came these things to pass
 o how mine eyes do loathe his visage now
oberon silence awhile robin take off this head
 titania music call and strike more dead
 than common sleep of all these five the sense
titania music ho music such as charmeth sleep
 music still
puck now when thou wakest with thine
 own fool's eyes peep
oberon sound music come my queen take hands with me
 and rock the ground whereon these sleepers be
 now thou and i are new in amity
 and will tomorrow midnight solemnly
 dance in duke theseus house triumphantly
 and bless it to all fair prosperity
 there shall the pairs of faithful lovers be
 wedded with theseus all in jollity
puck fairy king attend and mark
 i do hear the morning lark
oberon then my queen in silence sad
 trip we after the night's shade
 we the globe can compass soon
 swifter than the wandering moon
titania come my lord and in our flight
 tell me how it came this night
 that i sleeping here was found
 with these mortals on the ground
 exeunt
 horns winded within
 enter theseus hippolyta egeus and train
theseus go one of you find out the forester
 for now our observation is perform'd
 and since we have the vaward of the day
 my love shall hear the music of my hounds
 uncouple in the western valley let them go
 dispatch i say and find the forester
 exit an attendant
 we will fair queen up to the mountain's top
 and mark the musical confusion
 of hounds and echo in conjunction
hippolyta i was with hercules and cadmus once
 when in a wood of crete they bay'd the bear
 with hounds of sparta never did i hear
 such gallant chiding for besides the groves
 the skies the fountains every region near
 seem'd all one mutual cry i never heard
 so musical a discord such sweet thunder
theseus my hounds are bred out of the spartan kind
 so flew'd so sanded and their heads are hung
 with ears that sweep away the morning dew
 crookknee'd and dewlapp'd like thessalian bulls
 slow in pursuit but match'd in mouth like bells
 each under each a cry more tuneable
 was never holla'd to nor cheer'd with horn
 in crete in sparta nor in thessaly
 judge when you hear but soft what nymphs are these
egeus my lord this is my daughter here asleep
 and this lysander this demetrius is
 this helena old nedar's helena
 i wonder of their being here together
theseus no doubt they rose up early to observe
 the rite of may and hearing our intent
 came here in grace our solemnity
 but speak egeus is not this the day
 that hermia should give answer of her choice
egeus it is my lord
theseus go bid the huntsmen wake them with their horns
 horns and shout within lysander demetrius
 helena and hermia wake and start up
 good morrow friends saint valentine is past
 begin these woodbirds but to couple now
lysander pardon my lord
theseus i pray you all stand up
 i know you two are rival enemies
 how comes this gentle concord in the world
 that hatred is so far from jealousy
 to sleep by hate and fear no enmity
lysander my lord i shall reply amazedly
 half sleep half waking but as yet i swear
 i cannot truly say how i came here
 but as i thinkfor truly would i speak
 and now do i bethink me so it is
 i came with hermia hither our intent
 was to be gone from athens where we might
 without the peril of the athenian law
egeus enough enough my lord you have enough
 i beg the law the law upon his head
 they would have stolen away they would demetrius
 thereby to have defeated you and me
 you of your wife and me of my consent
 of my consent that she should be your wife
demetrius my lord fair helen told me of their stealth
 of this their purpose hither to this wood
 and i in fury hither follow'd them
 fair helena in fancy following me
 but my good lord i wot not by what power
 but by some power it ismy love to hermia
 melted as the snow seems to me now
 as the remembrance of an idle gaud
 which in my childhood i did dote upon
 and all the faith the virtue of my heart
 the object and the pleasure of mine eye
 is only helena to her my lord
 was i betroth'd ere i saw hermia
 but like in sickness did i loathe this food
 but as in health come to my natural taste
 now i do wish it love it long for it
 and will for evermore be true to it
theseus fair lovers you are fortunately met
 of this discourse we more will hear anon
 egeus i will overbear your will
 for in the temple by and by with us
 these couples shall eternally be knit
 and for the morning now is something worn
 our purposed hunting shall be set aside
 away with us to athens three and three
 we'll hold a feast in great solemnity
 come hippolyta
 exeunt theseus hippolyta egeus and train
demetrius these things seem small and undistinguishable
hermia methinks i see these things with parted eye
 when every thing seems double
helena so methinks
 and i have found demetrius like a jewel
 mine own and not mine own
demetrius are you sure
 that we are awake it seems to me
 that yet we sleep we dream do not you think
 the duke was here and bid us follow him
hermia yea and my father
helena and hippolyta
lysander and he did bid us follow to the temple
demetrius why then we are awake let's follow him
 and by the way let us recount our dreams
 exeunt
bottom awaking when my cue comes call me and i will
 answer my next is most fair pyramus heighho
 peter quince flute the bellowsmender snout
 the tinker starveling god's my life stolen
 hence and left me asleep i have had a most rare
 vision i have had a dream past the wit of man to
 say what dream it was man is but an ass if he go
 about to expound this dream methought i wasthere
 is no man can tell what methought i wasand
 methought i hadbut man is but a patched fool if
 he will offer to say what methought i had the eye
 of man hath not heard the ear of man hath not
 seen man's hand is not able to taste his tongue
 to conceive nor his heart to report what my dream
 was i will get peter quince to write a ballad of
 this dream it shall be called bottom's dream
 because it hath no bottom and i will sing it in the
 latter end of a play before the duke
 peradventure to make it the more gracious i shall
 sing it at her death

quince have you sent to bottom's house is he come home yet
starveling he cannot be heard of out of doubt he is
