 show me thy thought
iago my lord you know i love you
othello i think thou dost
 and for i know thou'rt full of love and honesty
 and weigh'st thy words before thou givest them breath
 therefore these stops of thine fright me the more
 for such things in a false disloyal knave
 are tricks of custom but in a man that's just
 they are close delations working from the heart
 that passion cannot rule
iago for michael cassio
 i dare be sworn i think that he is honest
othello i think so too
iago men should be what they seem
 or those that be not would they might seem none
othello certain men should be what they seem
iago why then i think cassio's an honest man
othello nay yet there's more in this
 i prithee speak to me as to thy thinkings
 as thou dost ruminate and give thy worst of thoughts
 the worst of words
iago good my lord pardon me
 though i am bound to every act of duty
 i am not bound to that all slaves are free to
 utter my thoughts why say they are vile and false
 as where's that palace whereinto foul things
 sometimes intrude not who has a breast so pure
 but some uncleanly apprehensions
 keep leets and lawdays and in session sit
 with meditations lawful
othello thou dost conspire against thy friend iago
 if thou but think'st him wrong'd and makest his ear
 a stranger to thy thoughts
iago i do beseech you
 though i perchance am vicious in my guess
 as i confess it is my nature's plague
 to spy into abuses and oft my jealousy
 shapes faults that are notthat your wisdom yet
 from one that so imperfectly conceits
 would take no notice nor build yourself a trouble
 out of his scattering and unsure observance
 it were not for your quiet nor your good
 nor for my manhood honesty or wisdom
 to let you know my thoughts
othello what dost thou mean
iago good name in man and woman dear my lord
 is the immediate jewel of their souls
 who steals my purse steals trash tis something nothing
 twas mine tis his and has been slave to thousands
 but he that filches from me my good name
 robs me of that which not enriches him
 and makes me poor indeed
othello by heaven i'll know thy thoughts
iago you cannot if my heart were in your hand
 nor shall not whilst tis in my custody
othello ha
iago o beware my lord of jealousy
 it is the greeneyed monster which doth mock
 the meat it feeds on that cuckold lives in bliss
 who certain of his fate loves not his wronger
 but o what damned minutes tells he o'er
 who dotes yet doubts suspects yet strongly loves
othello o misery
iago poor and content is rich and rich enough
 but riches fineless is as poor as winter
 to him that ever fears he shall be poor
 good heaven the souls of all my tribe defend
 from jealousy
othello why why is this
 think'st thou i'ld make a lie of jealousy
 to follow still the changes of the moon
 with fresh suspicions no to be once in doubt
 is once to be resolved exchange me for a goat
 when i shall turn the business of my soul
 to such exsufflicate and blown surmises
 matching thy inference tis not to make me jealous
 to say my wife is fair feeds well loves company
 is free of speech sings plays and dances well
 where virtue is these are more virtuous
 nor from mine own weak merits will i draw
 the smallest fear or doubt of her revolt
 for she had eyes and chose me no iago
 i'll see before i doubt when i doubt prove
 and on the proof there is no more but this
 away at once with love or jealousy
iago i am glad of it for now i shall have reason
 to show the love and duty that i bear you
 with franker spirit therefore as i am bound
 receive it from me i speak not yet of proof
 look to your wife observe her well with cassio
 wear your eye thus not jealous nor secure
 i would not have your free and noble nature
 out of selfbounty be abused look to't
 i know our country disposition well
 in venice they do let heaven see the pranks
 they dare not show their husbands their best conscience
 is not to leave't undone but keep't unknown
othello dost thou say so
iago she did deceive her father marrying you
 and when she seem'd to shake and fear your looks
 she loved them most
othello and so she did
iago why go to then
 she that so young could give out such a seeming
 to seal her father's eyes up close as oak
 he thought twas witchcraftbut i am much to blame
 i humbly do beseech you of your pardon
 for too much loving you
othello i am bound to thee for ever
iago i see this hath a little dash'd your spirits
othello not a jot not a jot
iago i faith i fear it has
 i hope you will consider what is spoke
 comes from my love but i do see you're moved
 i am to pray you not to strain my speech
 to grosser issues nor to larger reach
 than to suspicion
othello i will not
iago should you do so my lord
 my speech should fall into such vile success
 as my thoughts aim not at cassio's my worthy friend
 my lord i see you're moved
othello no not much moved
 i do not think but desdemona's honest
iago long live she so and long live you to think so
othello and yet how nature erring from itself
iago ay there's the point asto be bold with you
 not to affect many proposed matches
 of her own clime complexion and degree
 whereto we see in all things nature tends
 foh one may smell in such a will most rank
 foul disproportion thoughts unnatural
 but pardon me i do not in position
 distinctly speak of her though i may fear
 her will recoiling to her better judgment
 may fall to match you with her country forms
 and happily repent
othello farewell farewell
 if more thou dost perceive let me know more
 set on thy wife to observe leave me iago
iago going my lord i take my leave
othello why did i marry this honest creature doubtless
 sees and knows more much more than he unfolds
iago returning my lord i would i might entreat
 your honour
 to scan this thing no further leave it to time
 though it be fit that cassio have his place
 for sure he fills it up with great ability
 yet if you please to hold him off awhile
 you shall by that perceive him and his means
 note if your lady strain his entertainment
 with any strong or vehement importunity
 much will be seen in that in the mean time
 let me be thought too busy in my fears
 as worthy cause i have to fear i am
 and hold her free i do beseech your honour
othello fear not my government
iago i once more take my leave
 exit
othello this fellow's of exceeding honesty
 and knows all qualities with a learned spirit
 of human dealings if i do prove her haggard
 though that her jesses were my dear heartstrings
 i'ld whistle her off and let her down the wind
 to pray at fortune haply for i am black
 and have not those soft parts of conversation
 that chamberers have or for i am declined
 into the vale of yearsyet that's not much
 she's gone i am abused and my relief
 must be to loathe her o curse of marriage
 that we can call these delicate creatures ours
 and not their appetites i had rather be a toad
 and live upon the vapour of a dungeon
 than keep a corner in the thing i love
 for others uses yet tis the plague of great ones
 prerogatived are they less than the base
 tis destiny unshunnable like death
 even then this forked plague is fated to us
 when we do quicken desdemona comes
 reenter desdemona and emilia
 if she be false o then heaven mocks itself
 i'll not believe't
desdemona how now my dear othello
 your dinner and the generous islanders
 by you invited do attend your presence
othello i am to blame
desdemona why do you speak so faintly
 are you not well
othello i have a pain upon my forehead here
desdemona faith that's with watching twill away again
 let me but bind it hard within this hour
 it will be well
othello your napkin is too little
 he puts the handkerchief from him and it drops
 let it alone come i'll go in with you
desdemona i am very sorry that you are not well
 exeunt othello and desdemona
emilia i am glad i have found this napkin
 this was her first remembrance from the moor
 my wayward husband hath a hundred times
