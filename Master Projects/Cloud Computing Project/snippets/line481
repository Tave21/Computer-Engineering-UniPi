mistress quickly fairies black grey green and white
 you moonshine revellers and shades of night
 you orphan heirs of fixed destiny
 attend your office and your quality
 crier hobgoblin make the fairy oyes
pistol elves list your names silence you airy toys
 cricket to windsor chimneys shalt thou leap
 where fires thou find'st unraked and hearths unswept
 there pinch the maids as blue as bilberry
 our radiant queen hates sluts and sluttery
falstaff they are fairies he that speaks to them shall die
 i'll wink and couch no man their works must eye
 lies down upon his face
sir hugh evans where's bede go you and where you find a maid
 that ere she sleep has thrice her prayers said

 but those as sleep and think not on their sins
 pinch them arms legs backs shoulders sides and shins
mistress quickly about about
 search windsor castle elves within and out
 strew good luck ouphes on every sacred room
 that it may stand till the perpetual doom
 in state as wholesome as in state tis fit
 worthy the owner and the owner it
 the several chairs of order look you scour
 with juice of balm and every precious flower
 each fair instalment coat and several crest
 with loyal blazon evermore be blest
 and nightly meadowfairies look you sing
 like to the garter's compass in a ring
 the expressure that it bears green let it be
 more fertilefresh than all the field to see
 and honi soit qui mal y pense write
 in emerald tufts flowers purple blue and white
 let sapphire pearl and rich embroidery
 buckled below fair knighthood's bending knee
 fairies use flowers for their charactery
 away disperse but till tis one o'clock
 our dance of custom round about the oak
 of herne the hunter let us not forget
sir hugh evans pray you lock hand in hand yourselves in order set
 and twenty glowworms shall our lanterns be
 to guide our measure round about the tree
 but stay i smell a man of middleearth
falstaff heavens defend me from that welsh fairy lest he
 transform me to a piece of cheese
pistol vile worm thou wast o'erlook'd even in thy birth
mistress quickly with trialfire touch me his fingerend
 if he be chaste the flame will back descend
 and turn him to no pain but if he start
 it is the flesh of a corrupted heart
pistol a trial come
sir hugh evans come will this wood take fire
 they burn him with their tapers
falstaff oh oh oh
mistress quickly corrupt corrupt and tainted in desire
 about him fairies sing a scornful rhyme
 and as you trip still pinch him to your time
 
 song
 fie on sinful fantasy
 fie on lust and luxury
 lust is but a bloody fire
