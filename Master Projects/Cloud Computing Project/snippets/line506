 dare and when you dare do me right or i will
 protest your cowardice you have killed a sweet
 lady and her death shall fall heavy on you let me
 hear from you
claudio well i will meet you so i may have good cheer
don pedro what a feast a feast
claudio i faith i thank him he hath bid me to a calf's
 head and a capon the which if i do not carve most
 curiously say my knife's naught shall i not find
 a woodcock too
benedick sir your wit ambles well it goes easily
don pedro i'll tell thee how beatrice praised thy wit the
 other day i said thou hadst a fine wit true'
 said she a fine little one no said i a
 great wit right says she a great gross one'
 nay said i a good wit just said she it
 hurts nobody nay said i the gentleman
 is wise certain said she a wise gentleman'
 nay said i he hath the tongues that i
 believe said she for he swore a thing to me on
 monday night which he forswore on tuesday morning
 there's a double tongue there's two tongues thus
 did she an hour together transshape thy particular
 virtues yet at last she concluded with a sigh thou
 wast the properest man in italy
claudio for the which she wept heartily and said she cared
 not
don pedro yea that she did but yet for all that an if she
 did not hate him deadly she would love him dearly
 the old man's daughter told us all
claudio all all and moreover god saw him when he was
 hid in the garden
don pedro but when shall we set the savage bull's horns on
 the sensible benedick's head
claudio yea and text underneath here dwells benedick the
 married man'
benedick fare you well boy you know my mind i will leave
 you now to your gossiplike humour you break jests
 as braggarts do their blades which god be thanked
 hurt not my lord for your many courtesies i thank
 you i must discontinue your company your brother
 the bastard is fled from messina you have among
 you killed a sweet and innocent lady for my lord
 lackbeard there he and i shall meet and till
 then peace be with him
 exit
don pedro he is in earnest
claudio in most profound earnest and i'll warrant you for
 the love of beatrice
don pedro and hath challenged thee
claudio most sincerely
don pedro what a pretty thing man is when he goes in his
 doublet and hose and leaves off his wit
claudio he is then a giant to an ape but then is an ape a
 doctor to such a man
don pedro but soft you let me be pluck up my heart and
 be sad did he not say my brother was fled
 enter dogberry verges and the watch with conrade
 and borachio
dogberry come you sir if justice cannot tame you she
 shall ne'er weigh more reasons in her balance nay
 an you be a cursing hypocrite once you must be looked to
don pedro how now two of my brother's men bound borachio
 one
claudio hearken after their offence my lord
don pedro officers what offence have these men done
dogberry marry sir they have committed false report
 moreover they have spoken untruths secondarily
 they are slanders sixth and lastly they have
 belied a lady thirdly they have verified unjust
 things and to conclude they are lying knaves
don pedro first i ask thee what they have done thirdly i
 ask thee what's their offence sixth and lastly why
 they are committed and to conclude what you lay
 to their charge
claudio rightly reasoned and in his own division and by
 my troth there's one meaning well suited
don pedro who have you offended masters that you are thus
 bound to your answer this learned constable is
 too cunning to be understood what's your offence
borachio sweet prince let me go no farther to mine answer
 do you hear me and let this count kill me i have
 deceived even your very eyes what your wisdoms
 could not discover these shallow fools have brought
 to light who in the night overheard me confessing
 to this man how don john your brother incensed me
 to slander the lady hero how you were brought into
 the orchard and saw me court margaret in hero's
 garments how you disgraced her when you should
 marry her my villany they have upon record which
 i had rather seal with my death than repeat over
 to my shame the lady is dead upon mine and my
 master's false accusation and briefly i desire
 nothing but the reward of a villain
don pedro runs not this speech like iron through your blood
claudio i have drunk poison whiles he utter'd it
don pedro but did my brother set thee on to this
borachio yea and paid me richly for the practise of it
don pedro he is composed and framed of treachery
 and fled he is upon this villany
claudio sweet hero now thy image doth appear
 in the rare semblance that i loved it first
dogberry come bring away the plaintiffs by this time our
 sexton hath reformed signior leonato of the matter
 and masters do not forget to specify when time
 and place shall serve that i am an ass
verges here here comes master signior leonato and the
 sexton too
 reenter leonato and antonio with the sexton
leonato which is the villain let me see his eyes
 that when i note another man like him
 i may avoid him which of these is he
borachio if you would know your wronger look on me
leonato art thou the slave that with thy breath hast kill'd
 mine innocent child
borachio yea even i alone
leonato no not so villain thou beliest thyself
 here stand a pair of honourable men
 a third is fled that had a hand in it
 i thank you princes for my daughter's death
 record it with your high and worthy deeds
 twas bravely done if you bethink you of it
claudio i know not how to pray your patience
 yet i must speak choose your revenge yourself
 impose me to what penance your invention
 can lay upon my sin yet sinn'd i not
 but in mistaking
don pedro by my soul nor i
 and yet to satisfy this good old man
 i would bend under any heavy weight
 that he'll enjoin me to
leonato i cannot bid you bid my daughter live
 that were impossible but i pray you both
 possess the people in messina here
 how innocent she died and if your love
 can labour ought in sad invention
 hang her an epitaph upon her tomb
 and sing it to her bones sing it tonight
 tomorrow morning come you to my house
 and since you could not be my soninlaw
 be yet my nephew my brother hath a daughter
 almost the copy of my child that's dead
 and she alone is heir to both of us

 and so dies my revenge
claudio o noble sir
 your overkindness doth wring tears from me
 i do embrace your offer and dispose
 for henceforth of poor claudio
leonato tomorrow then i will expect your coming
 tonight i take my leave this naughty man
 shall face to face be brought to margaret
 who i believe was pack'd in all this wrong
 hired to it by your brother
borachio no by my soul she was not
 nor knew not what she did when she spoke to me
 but always hath been just and virtuous
 in any thing that i do know by her
dogberry moreover sir which indeed is not under white and
 black this plaintiff here the offender did call
 me ass i beseech you let it be remembered in his
 punishment and also the watch heard them talk of
 one deformed they say be wears a key in his ear and
 a lock hanging by it and borrows money in god's
 name the which he hath used so long and never paid
 that now men grow hardhearted and will lend nothing
 for god's sake pray you examine him upon that point

 reverend youth and i praise god for you
