banquo ay my good lord our time does call upon s
macbeth i wish your horses swift and sure of foot
 and so i do commend you to their backs farewell
 exit banquo
 let every man be master of his time
 till seven at night to make society
 the sweeter welcome we will keep ourself
 till suppertime alone while then god be with you
 exeunt all but macbeth and an attendant
 sirrah a word with you attend those men
 our pleasure
attendant they are my lord without the palace gate
macbeth bring them before us
 exit attendant
 to be thus is nothing
 but to be safely thusour fears in banquo
 stick deep and in his royalty of nature
 reigns that which would be fear'd tis much he dares
 and to that dauntless temper of his mind
 he hath a wisdom that doth guide his valour
 to act in safety there is none but he
 whose being i do fear and under him
 my genius is rebuked as it is said
 mark antony's was by caesar he chid the sisters
 when first they put the name of king upon me
 and bade them speak to him then prophetlike
 they hail'd him father to a line of kings
 upon my head they placed a fruitless crown
 and put a barren sceptre in my gripe
 thence to be wrench'd with an unlineal hand
 no son of mine succeeding if t be so
 for banquo's issue have i filed my mind
 for them the gracious duncan have i murder'd
 put rancours in the vessel of my peace
 only for them and mine eternal jewel
 given to the common enemy of man
 to make them kings the seed of banquo kings
 rather than so come fate into the list
 and champion me to the utterance who's there
 reenter attendant with two murderers
 now go to the door and stay there till we call
 exit attendant
 was it not yesterday we spoke together
first murderer it was so please your highness
macbeth well then now
 have you consider'd of my speeches know
 that it was he in the times past which held you
 so under fortune which you thought had been
 our innocent self this i made good to you
 in our last conference pass'd in probation with you
 how you were borne in hand how cross'd
 the instruments
 who wrought with them and all things else that might
 to half a soul and to a notion crazed
 say thus did banquo'
first murderer you made it known to us
macbeth i did so and went further which is now
 our point of second meeting do you find
 your patience so predominant in your nature
 that you can let this go are you so gospell'd
 to pray for this good man and for his issue
 whose heavy hand hath bow'd you to the grave
 and beggar'd yours for ever
first murderer we are men my liege
macbeth ay in the catalogue ye go for men
 as hounds and greyhounds mongrels spaniels curs
 shoughs waterrugs and demiwolves are clept
 all by the name of dogs the valued file
 distinguishes the swift the slow the subtle
 the housekeeper the hunter every one
 according to the gift which bounteous nature
 hath in him closed whereby he does receive
 particular addition from the bill
 that writes them all alike and so of men
 now if you have a station in the file
 not i the worst rank of manhood say t
 and i will put that business in your bosoms
 whose execution takes your enemy off
 grapples you to the heart and love of us
 who wear our health but sickly in his life
 which in his death were perfect
second murderer i am one my liege
 whom the vile blows and buffets of the world
 have so incensed that i am reckless what
 i do to spite the world
first murderer and i another
 so weary with disasters tugg'd with fortune
 that i would set my lie on any chance
 to mend it or be rid on't
macbeth both of you
 know banquo was your enemy
both murderers true my lord
macbeth so is he mine and in such bloody distance
 that every minute of his being thrusts
 against my near'st of life and though i could
 with barefaced power sweep him from my sight
 and bid my will avouch it yet i must not
 for certain friends that are both his and mine
 whose loves i may not drop but wail his fall
 who i myself struck down and thence it is
 that i to your assistance do make love
 masking the business from the common eye
 for sundry weighty reasons
second murderer we shall my lord
 perform what you command us
first murderer though our lives
macbeth your spirits shine through you within this hour at most
 i will advise you where to plant yourselves
 acquaint you with the perfect spy o the time
 the moment on't for't must be done tonight
 and something from the palace always thought
 that i require a clearness and with him
 to leave no rubs nor botches in the work
 fleance his son that keeps him company
 whose absence is no less material to me
 than is his father's must embrace the fate
 of that dark hour resolve yourselves apart
 i'll come to you anon
both murderers we are resolved my lord
macbeth i'll call upon you straight abide within
 exeunt murderers
 it is concluded banquo thy soul's flight
 if it find heaven must find it out tonight
 exit
 macbeth
act iii
scene ii the palace
 enter lady macbeth and a servant
lady macbeth is banquo gone from court
servant ay madam but returns again tonight
lady macbeth say to the king i would attend his leisure
 for a few words
servant madam i will
 exit
lady macbeth nought's had all's spent
 where our desire is got without content
 tis safer to be that which we destroy
 than by destruction dwell in doubtful joy
 enter macbeth
 how now my lord why do you keep alone
 of sorriest fancies your companions making
 using those thoughts which should indeed have died
 with them they think on things without all remedy
 should be without regard what's done is done
macbeth we have scotch'd the snake not kill'd it
 she'll close and be herself whilst our poor malice
 remains in danger of her former tooth
 but let the frame of things disjoint both the
 worlds suffer
 ere we will eat our meal in fear and sleep
 in the affliction of these terrible dreams
 that shake us nightly better be with the dead
 whom we to gain our peace have sent to peace
 than on the torture of the mind to lie
 in restless ecstasy duncan is in his grave
 after life's fitful fever he sleeps well
 treason has done his worst nor steel nor poison
 malice domestic foreign levy nothing
 can touch him further
lady macbeth come on
 gentle my lord sleek o'er your rugged looks
 be bright and jovial among your guests tonight
macbeth so shall i love and so i pray be you
 let your remembrance apply to banquo
 present him eminence both with eye and tongue
 unsafe the while that we
 must lave our honours in these flattering streams
 and make our faces vizards to our hearts
 disguising what they are
lady macbeth you must leave this
macbeth o full of scorpions is my mind dear wife
 thou know'st that banquo and his fleance lives
lady macbeth but in them nature's copy's not eterne
macbeth there's comfort yet they are assailable
 then be thou jocund ere the bat hath flown
 his cloister'd flight ere to black hecate's summons
 the shardborne beetle with his drowsy hums
 hath rung night's yawning peal there shall be done
 a deed of dreadful note
lady macbeth what's to be done
macbeth be innocent of the knowledge dearest chuck
 till thou applaud the deed come seeling night
 scarf up the tender eye of pitiful day
 and with thy bloody and invisible hand
 cancel and tear to pieces that great bond
 which keeps me pale light thickens and the crow
 makes wing to the rooky wood
 good things of day begin to droop and drowse
 while night's black agents to their preys do rouse
 thou marvell'st at my words but hold thee still
 things bad begun make strong themselves by ill
 so prithee go with me
 exeunt
 macbeth
act iii
scene iii a park near the palace
