aaron here lacks but your mother for to say amen
chiron and that would she for twenty thousand more
demetrius come let us go and pray to all the gods
 for our beloved mother in her pains
aaron aside pray to the devils the gods have given us over
 trumpets sound within
demetrius why do the emperor's trumpets flourish thus
chiron belike for joy the emperor hath a son
demetrius soft who comes here
 enter a nurse with a blackamoor child in her arms
nurse good morrow lords
 o tell me did you see aaron the moor
aaron well more or less or ne'er a whit at all
 here aaron is and what with aaron now
nurse o gentle aaron we are all undone
 now help or woe betide thee evermore
aaron why what a caterwauling dost thou keep
 what dost thou wrap and fumble in thine arms
nurse o that which i would hide from heaven's eye
 our empress shame and stately rome's disgrace
 she is deliver'd lords she is deliver'd
aaron to whom
nurse i mean she is brought abed
aaron well god give her good rest what hath he sent her
nurse a devil
aaron why then she is the devil's dam a joyful issue
nurse a joyless dismal black and sorrowful issue
 here is the babe as loathsome as a toad
 amongst the fairest breeders of our clime
 the empress sends it thee thy stamp thy seal
 and bids thee christen it with thy dagger's point
aaron zounds ye whore is black so base a hue
 sweet blowse you are a beauteous blossom sure
demetrius villain what hast thou done
aaron that which thou canst not undo
chiron thou hast undone our mother
aaron villain i have done thy mother
demetrius and therein hellish dog thou hast undone
 woe to her chance and damn'd her loathed choice
 accursed the offspring of so foul a fiend
chiron it shall not live
aaron it shall not die
nurse aaron it must the mother wills it so
aaron what must it nurse then let no man but i
 do execution on my flesh and blood
demetrius i'll broach the tadpole on my rapier's point
 nurse give it me my sword shall soon dispatch it
aaron sooner this sword shall plough thy bowels up
 takes the child from the nurse and draws
 stay murderous villains will you kill your brother
 now by the burning tapers of the sky
 that shone so brightly when this boy was got
 he dies upon my scimitar's sharp point
 that touches this my firstborn son and heir
 i tell you younglings not enceladus
 with all his threatening band of typhon's brood
 nor great alcides nor the god of war
 shall seize this prey out of his father's hands
 what what ye sanguine shallowhearted boys
 ye whitelimed walls ye alehouse painted signs
 coalblack is better than another hue
 in that it scorns to bear another hue
 for all the water in the ocean
 can never turn the swan's black legs to white
 although she lave them hourly in the flood
 tell the empress from me i am of age
 to keep mine own excuse it how she can
demetrius wilt thou betray thy noble mistress thus
aaron my mistress is my mistress this myself
 the vigour and the picture of my youth
 this before all the world do i prefer
 this maugre all the world will i keep safe
 or some of you shall smoke for it in rome
demetrius by this our mother is forever shamed
chiron rome will despise her for this foul escape
nurse the emperor in his rage will doom her death
chiron i blush to think upon this ignomy
aaron why there's the privilege your beauty bears
 fie treacherous hue that will betray with blushing
 the close enacts and counsels of the heart
 here's a young lad framed of another leer
 look how the black slave smiles upon the father
 as who should say old lad i am thine own'
 he is your brother lords sensibly fed
 of that selfblood that first gave life to you
 and from that womb where you imprison'd were
 he is enfranchised and come to light
 nay he is your brother by the surer side
 although my seal be stamped in his face
nurse aaron what shall i say unto the empress
demetrius advise thee aaron what is to be done
 and we will all subscribe to thy advice
 save thou the child so we may all be safe
aaron then sit we down and let us all consult
 my son and i will have the wind of you
 keep there now talk at pleasure of your safety
 they sit
demetrius how many women saw this child of his
aaron why so brave lords when we join in league
 i am a lamb but if you brave the moor
 the chafed boar the mountain lioness
 the ocean swells not so as aaron storms
 but say again how many saw the child
nurse cornelia the midwife and myself
 and no one else but the deliver'd empress
aaron the empress the midwife and yourself
 two may keep counsel when the third's away
 go to the empress tell her this i said
 he kills the nurse
 weke weke so cries a pig prepared to the spit
demetrius what mean'st thou aaron wherefore didst thou this
aaron o lord sir tis a deed of policy
 shall she live to betray this guilt of ours
 a longtongued babbling gossip no lords no
 and now be it known to you my full intent
 not far one muli lives my countryman
 his wife but yesternight was brought to bed
 his child is like to her fair as you are
 go pack with him and give the mother gold
 and tell them both the circumstance of all
 and how by this their child shall be advanced
 and be received for the emperor's heir
 and substituted in the place of mine
 to calm this tempest whirling in the court
 and let the emperor dandle him for his own
 hark ye lords ye see i have given her physic
 pointing to the nurse
 and you must needs bestow her funeral
 the fields are near and you are gallant grooms
 this done see that you take no longer days
 but send the midwife presently to me
 the midwife and the nurse well made away
 then let the ladies tattle what they please
chiron aaron i see thou wilt not trust the air
 with secrets
demetrius for this care of tamora
 herself and hers are highly bound to thee
 exeunt demetrius and chiron bearing off the
 nurse's body
aaron now to the goths as swift as swallow flies
 there to dispose this treasure in mine arms
 and secretly to greet the empress friends
 come on you thick lipp'd slave i'll bear you hence
 for it is you that puts us to our shifts
 i'll make you feed on berries and on roots
 and feed on curds and whey and suck the goat
 and cabin in a cave and bring you up
 to be a warrior and command a camp
 exit
 titus andronicus
act iv
scene iii the same a public place
 enter titus bearing arrows with letters at the
 ends of them with him marcus young lucius
 publius sempronius caius and other gentlemen
 with bows
titus andronicus come marcus come kinsmen this is the way
 sir boy now let me see your archery
 look ye draw home enough and tis there straight
 terras astraea reliquit
 be you remember'd marcus she's gone she's fled
 sirs take you to your tools you cousins shall
 go sound the ocean and cast your nets
 happily you may catch her in the sea
 yet there's as little justice as at land
 no publius and sempronius you must do it
 tis you must dig with mattock and with spade
 and pierce the inmost centre of the earth
 then when you come to pluto's region
 i pray you deliver him this petition
 tell him it is for justice and for aid
 and that it comes from old andronicus
 shaken with sorrows in ungrateful rome
 ah rome well well i made thee miserable
 what time i threw the people's suffrages
 on him that thus doth tyrannize o'er me
 go get you gone and pray be careful all
 and leave you not a manofwar unsearch'd
 this wicked emperor may have shipp'd her hence
 and kinsmen then we may go pipe for justice
marcus andronicus o publius is not this a heavy case
 to see thy noble uncle thus distract
publius therefore my lord it highly us concerns
 by day and night to attend him carefully
 and feed his humour kindly as we may
 till time beget some careful remedy
marcus andronicus kinsmen his sorrows are past remedy
 join with the goths and with revengeful war
 take wreak on rome for this ingratitude
 and vengeance on the traitor saturnine
titus andronicus publius how now how now my masters
 what have you met with her
publius no my good lord but pluto sends you word
 if you will have revenge from hell you shall
 marry for justice she is so employ'd
 he thinks with jove in heaven or somewhere else
 so that perforce you must needs stay a time
titus andronicus he doth me wrong to feed me with delays
 i'll dive into the burning lake below
 and pull her out of acheron by the heels
