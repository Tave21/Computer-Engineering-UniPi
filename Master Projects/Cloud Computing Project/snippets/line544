 sorcerer that by his cunning hath cheated me of the island
ariel thou liest
caliban thou liest thou jesting monkey thou i would my
 valiant master would destroy thee i do not lie
stephano trinculo if you trouble him any more in's tale by
 this hand i will supplant some of your teeth
trinculo why i said nothing
stephano mum then and no more proceed
caliban i say by sorcery he got this isle
 from me he got it if thy greatness will
 revenge it on himfor i know thou darest
 but this thing dare not
stephano that's most certain
caliban thou shalt be lord of it and i'll serve thee
stephano how now shall this be compassed
 canst thou bring me to the party
caliban yea yea my lord i'll yield him thee asleep
 where thou mayst knock a nail into his bead
ariel thou liest thou canst not
caliban what a pied ninny's this thou scurvy patch
 i do beseech thy greatness give him blows
 and take his bottle from him when that's gone
 he shall drink nought but brine for i'll not show him
 where the quick freshes are
stephano trinculo run into no further danger
 interrupt the monster one word further and
 by this hand i'll turn my mercy out o doors
 and make a stockfish of thee

 wits and bearing too a pox o your bottle

 off
caliban beat him enough after a little time
 i'll beat him too
stephano stand farther come proceed
caliban why as i told thee tis a custom with him
 i th afternoon to sleep there thou mayst brain him
 having first seized his books or with a log
 batter his skull or paunch him with a stake
 or cut his wezand with thy knife remember
 first to possess his books for without them
 he's but a sot as i am nor hath not
 one spirit to command they all do hate him
 as rootedly as i burn but his books
 he has brave utensilsfor so he calls them
 which when he has a house he'll deck withal
 and that most deeply to consider is
 the beauty of his daughter he himself
 calls her a nonpareil i never saw a woman
 but only sycorax my dam and she
 but she as far surpasseth sycorax
 as great'st does least
stephano is it so brave a lass
caliban ay lord she will become thy bed i warrant
 and bring thee forth brave brood
stephano monster i will kill this man his daughter and i
 will be king and queensave our gracesand
 trinculo and thyself shall be viceroys dost thou
 like the plot trinculo
trinculo excellent
stephano give me thy hand i am sorry i beat thee but
 while thou livest keep a good tongue in thy head
caliban within this half hour will he be asleep
 wilt thou destroy him then
stephano ay on mine honour
ariel this will i tell my master
caliban thou makest me merry i am full of pleasure
 let us be jocund will you troll the catch
 you taught me but whileere
stephano at thy request monster i will do reason any
 reason come on trinculo let us sing
 sings
 flout em and scout em
 and scout em and flout em
 thought is free
caliban that's not the tune
 ariel plays the tune on a tabour and pipe
stephano what is this same
trinculo this is the tune of our catch played by the picture
 of nobody
stephano if thou beest a man show thyself in thy likeness
 if thou beest a devil take't as thou list
trinculo o forgive me my sins
stephano he that dies pays all debts i defy thee mercy upon us
caliban art thou afeard
stephano no monster not i
caliban be not afeard the isle is full of noises
 sounds and sweet airs that give delight and hurt not
 sometimes a thousand twangling instruments
 will hum about mine ears and sometime voices
 that if i then had waked after long sleep
 will make me sleep again and then in dreaming
 the clouds methought would open and show riches
 ready to drop upon me that when i waked
 i cried to dream again
stephano this will prove a brave kingdom to me where i shall
 have my music for nothing
caliban when prospero is destroyed
stephano that shall be by and by i remember the story
trinculo the sound is going away let's follow it and
 after do our work
stephano lead monster we'll follow i would i could see
 this tabourer he lays it on
trinculo wilt come i'll follow stephano

 the tempest
act iii
scene iii another part of the island
 enter alonso sebastian antonio gonzalo
 adrian francisco and others
gonzalo by'r lakin i can go no further sir
 my old bones ache here's a maze trod indeed
 through forthrights and meanders by your patience
 i needs must rest me
alonso old lord i cannot blame thee
 who am myself attach'd with weariness
 to the dulling of my spirits sit down and rest
 even here i will put off my hope and keep it
 no longer for my flatterer he is drown'd
 whom thus we stray to find and the sea mocks
 our frustrate search on land well let him go
antonio aside to sebastian i am right glad that he's so
 out of hope
 do not for one repulse forego the purpose
 that you resolved to effect
sebastian aside to antonio the next advantage
 will we take throughly
antonio aside to sebastian let it be tonight
 for now they are oppress'd with travel they
 will not nor cannot use such vigilance
 as when they are fresh
sebastian aside to antonio i say tonight no more
 solemn and strange music
alonso what harmony is this my good friends hark
gonzalo marvellous sweet music
 enter prospero above invisible enter several
 strange shapes bringing in a banquet
 they dance about it with gentle actions of
 salutation and inviting the king &c to
 eat they depart
alonso give us kind keepers heavens what were these
sebastian a living drollery now i will believe
 that there are unicorns that in arabia
 there is one tree the phoenix throne one phoenix
 at this hour reigning there
antonio i'll believe both
 and what does else want credit come to me
 and i'll be sworn tis true travellers ne'er did
 lie
 though fools at home condemn em
gonzalo if in naples
 i should report this now would they believe me
 if i should say i saw such islanders
 for certes these are people of the island
 who though they are of monstrous shape yet note
 their manners are more gentlekind than of
 our human generation you shall find
 many nay almost any
prospero aside honest lord
 thou hast said well for some of you there present
 are worse than devils
alonso i cannot too much muse
 such shapes such gesture and such sound expressing
 although they want the use of tongue a kind
 of excellent dumb discourse
prospero aside praise in departing
francisco they vanish'd strangely
sebastian no matter since
 they have left their viands behind for we have stomachs
 will't please you taste of what is here
