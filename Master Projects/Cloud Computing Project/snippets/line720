queen katharine sir i desire you do me right and justice
 and to bestow your pity on me for
 i am a most poor woman and a stranger
 born out of your dominions having here
 no judge indifferent nor no more assurance
 of equal friendship and proceeding alas sir
 in what have i offended you what cause
 hath my behavior given to your displeasure
 that thus you should proceed to put me off
 and take your good grace from me heaven witness
 i have been to you a true and humble wife
 at all times to your will conformable
 ever in fear to kindle your dislike
 yea subject to your countenance glad or sorry
 as i saw it inclined when was the hour
 i ever contradicted your desire
 or made it not mine too or which of your friends
 have i not strove to love although i knew
 he were mine enemy what friend of mine
 that had to him derived your anger did i
 continue in my liking nay gave notice
 he was from thence discharged sir call to mind
 that i have been your wife in this obedience

 with many children by you if in the course
 and process of this time you can report
 and prove it too against mine honour aught
 my bond to wedlock or my love and duty
 against your sacred person in god's name
 turn me away and let the foul'st contempt
 shut door upon me and so give me up
 to the sharp'st kind of justice please you sir
 the king your father was reputed for
 a prince most prudent of an excellent
 and unmatch'd wit and judgment ferdinand
 my father king of spain was reckon'd one
 the wisest prince that there had reign'd by many
 a year before it is not to be question'd
 that they had gather'd a wise council to them
 of every realm that did debate this business
 who deem'd our marriage lawful wherefore i humbly
 beseech you sir to spare me till i may
 be by my friends in spain advised whose counsel
 i will implore if not i the name of god
 your pleasure be fulfill'd
cardinal wolsey you have here lady
 and of your choice these reverend fathers men
 of singular integrity and learning
 yea the elect o the land who are assembled
 to plead your cause it shall be therefore bootless
 that longer you desire the court as well
 for your own quiet as to rectify
 what is unsettled in the king
cardinal campeius his grace
 hath spoken well and justly therefore madam
 it's fit this royal session do proceed
 and that without delay their arguments
 be now produced and heard
queen katharine lord cardinal
 to you i speak
cardinal wolsey your pleasure madam
queen katharine sir
 i am about to weep but thinking that
 we are a queen or long have dream'd so certain
 the daughter of a king my drops of tears
 i'll turn to sparks of fire
cardinal wolsey be patient yet
queen katharine i will when you are humble nay before
 or god will punish me i do believe
 induced by potent circumstances that
 you are mine enemy and make my challenge
 you shall not be my judge for it is you
 have blown this coal betwixt my lord and me
 which god's dew quench therefore i say again
 i utterly abhor yea from my soul
 refuse you for my judge whom yet once more
 i hold my most malicious foe and think not
 at all a friend to truth
cardinal wolsey i do profess
 you speak not like yourself who ever yet
 have stood to charity and display'd the effects
 of disposition gentle and of wisdom
 o'ertopping woman's power madam you do me wrong
 i have no spleen against you nor injustice
 for you or any how far i have proceeded
 or how far further shall is warranted
 by a commission from the consistory
 yea the whole consistory of rome you charge me
 that i have blown this coal i do deny it
 the king is present if it be known to him
 that i gainsay my deed how may he wound
 and worthily my falsehood yea as much
 as you have done my truth if he know
 that i am free of your report he knows
 i am not of your wrong therefore in him
 it lies to cure me and the cure is to
 remove these thoughts from you the which before
 his highness shall speak in i do beseech
 you gracious madam to unthink your speaking
 and to say so no more
queen katharine my lord my lord
 i am a simple woman much too weak
 to oppose your cunning you're meek and
 humblemouth'd
 you sign your place and calling in full seeming
 with meekness and humility but your heart
 is cramm'd with arrogancy spleen and pride
