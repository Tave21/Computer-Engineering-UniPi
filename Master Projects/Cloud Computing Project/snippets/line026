and now israel what doth the lord thy god require of thee but to fear the lord thy god to walk in all his ways and to love him and to serve the lord thy god with all thy heart and with all thy soul
to keep the commandments of the lord and his statutes which i command thee this day for thy good
behold the heaven and the heaven of heavens is the lord's thy god the earth also with all that therein is
only the lord had a delight in thy fathers to love them and he chose their seed after them even you above all people as it is this day
circumcise therefore the foreskin of your heart and be no more stiffnecked
for the lord your god is god of gods and lord of lords a great god a mighty and a terrible which regardeth not persons nor taketh reward
he doth execute the judgment of the fatherless and widow and loveth the stranger in giving him food and raiment
love ye therefore the stranger for ye were strangers in the land of egypt
thou shalt fear the lord thy god him shalt thou serve and to him shalt thou cleave and swear by his name
he is thy praise and he is thy god that hath done for thee these great and terrible things which thine eyes have seen
thy fathers went down into egypt with threescore and ten persons and now the lord thy god hath made thee as the stars of heaven for multitude
therefore thou shalt love the lord thy god and keep his charge and his statutes and his judgments and his commandments alway
and know ye this day for i speak not with your children which have not known and which have not seen the chastisement of the lord your god his greatness his mighty hand and his stretched out arm
and his miracles and his acts which he did in the midst of egypt unto pharaoh the king of egypt and unto all his land
and what he did unto the army of egypt unto their horses and to their chariots how he made the water of the red sea to overflow them as they pursued after you and how the lord hath destroyed them unto this day
and what he did unto you in the wilderness until ye came into this place
and what he did unto dathan and abiram the sons of eliab the son of reuben how the earth opened her mouth and swallowed them up and their households and their tents and all the substance that was in their possession in the midst of all israel
but your eyes have seen all the great acts of the lord which he did
therefore shall ye keep all the commandments which i command you this day that ye may be strong and go in and possess the land whither ye go to possess it
and that ye may prolong your days in the land which the lord sware unto your fathers to give unto them and to their seed a land that floweth with milk and honey
for the land whither thou goest in to possess it is not as the land of egypt from whence ye came out where thou sowedst thy seed and wateredst it with thy foot as a garden of herbs
but the land whither ye go to possess it is a land of hills and valleys and drinketh water of the rain of heaven
a land which the lord thy god careth for the eyes of the lord thy god are always upon it from the beginning of the year even unto the end of the year
and it shall come to pass if ye shall hearken diligently unto my commandments which i command you this day to love the lord your god and to serve him with all your heart and with all your soul
that i will give you the rain of your land in his due season the first rain and the latter rain that thou mayest gather in thy corn and thy wine and thine oil
and i will send grass in thy fields for thy cattle that thou mayest eat and be full
take heed to yourselves that your heart be not deceived and ye turn aside and serve other gods and worship them
and then the lord's wrath be kindled against you and he shut up the heaven that there be no rain and that the land yield not her fruit and lest ye perish quickly from off the good land which the lord giveth you
therefore shall ye lay up these my words in your heart and in your soul and bind them for a sign upon your hand that they may be as frontlets between your eyes
and ye shall teach them your children speaking of them when thou sittest in thine house and when thou walkest by the way when thou liest down and when thou risest up
and thou shalt write them upon the door posts of thine house and upon thy gates
that your days may be multiplied and the days of your children in the land which the lord sware unto your fathers to give them as the days of heaven upon the earth
for if ye shall diligently keep all these commandments which i command you to do them to love the lord your god to walk in all his ways and to cleave unto him
then will the lord drive out all these nations from before you and ye shall possess greater nations and mightier than yourselves
every place whereon the soles of your feet shall tread shall be yours from the wilderness and lebanon from the river the river euphrates even unto the uttermost sea shall your coast be
there shall no man be able to stand before you for the lord your god shall lay the fear of you and the dread of you upon all the land that ye shall tread upon as he hath said unto you
behold i set before you this day a blessing and a curse
a blessing if ye obey the commandments of the lord your god which i command you this day
and a curse if ye will not obey the commandments of the lord your god but turn aside out of the way which i command you this day to go after other gods which ye have not known
and it shall come to pass when the lord thy god hath brought thee in unto the land whither thou goest to possess it that thou shalt put the blessing upon mount gerizim and the curse upon mount ebal
are they not on the other side jordan by the way where the sun goeth down in the land of the canaanites which dwell in the champaign over against gilgal beside the plains of moreh
for ye shall pass over jordan to go in to possess the land which the lord your god giveth you and ye shall possess it and dwell therein
and ye shall observe to do all the statutes and judgments which i set before you this day
these are the statutes and judgments which ye shall observe to do in the land which the lord god of thy fathers giveth thee to possess it all the days that ye live upon the earth
ye shall utterly destroy all the places wherein the nations which ye shall possess served their gods upon the high mountains and upon the hills and under every green tree
and ye shall overthrow their altars and break their pillars and burn their groves with fire and ye shall hew down the graven images of their gods and destroy the names of them out of that place
ye shall not do so unto the lord your god
but unto the place which the lord your god shall choose out of all your tribes to put his name there even unto his habitation shall ye seek and thither thou shalt come
and thither ye shall bring your burnt offerings and your sacrifices and your tithes and heave offerings of your hand and your vows and your freewill offerings and the firstlings of your herds and of your flocks
and there ye shall eat before the lord your god and ye shall rejoice in all that ye put your hand unto ye and your households wherein the lord thy god hath blessed thee
ye shall not do after all the things that we do here this day every man whatsoever is right in his own eyes
for ye are not as yet come to the rest and to the inheritance which the lord your god giveth you
but when ye go over jordan and dwell in the land which the lord your god giveth you to inherit and when he giveth you rest from all your enemies round about so that ye dwell in safety
then there shall be a place which the lord your god shall choose to cause his name to dwell there thither shall ye bring all that i command you your burnt offerings and your sacrifices your tithes and the heave offering of your hand and all your choice vows which ye vow unto the lord
and ye shall rejoice before the lord your god ye and your sons and your daughters and your menservants and your maidservants and the levite that is within your gates forasmuch as he hath no part nor inheritance with you
take heed to thyself that thou offer not thy burnt offerings in every place that thou seest
but in the place which the lord shall choose in one of thy tribes there thou shalt offer thy burnt offerings and there thou shalt do all that i command thee
notwithstanding thou mayest kill and eat flesh in all thy gates whatsoever thy soul lusteth after according to the blessing of the lord thy god which he hath given thee the unclean and the clean may eat thereof as of the roebuck and as of the hart
only ye shall not eat the blood ye shall pour it upon the earth as water
thou mayest not eat within thy gates the tithe of thy corn or of thy wine or of thy oil or the firstlings of thy herds or of thy flock nor any of thy vows which thou vowest nor thy freewill offerings or heave offering of thine hand
but thou must eat them before the lord thy god in the place which the lord thy god shall choose thou and thy son and thy daughter and thy manservant and thy maidservant and the levite that is within thy gates and thou shalt rejoice before the lord thy god in all that thou puttest thine hands unto
take heed to thyself that thou forsake not the levite as long as thou livest upon the earth
when the lord thy god shall enlarge thy border as he hath promised thee and thou shalt say i will eat flesh because thy soul longeth to eat flesh thou mayest eat flesh whatsoever thy soul lusteth after
if the place which the lord thy god hath chosen to put his name there be too far from thee then thou shalt kill of thy herd and of thy flock which the lord hath given thee as i have commanded thee and thou shalt eat in thy gates whatsoever thy soul lusteth after
even as the roebuck and the hart is eaten so thou shalt eat them the unclean and the clean shall eat of them alike
only be sure that thou eat not the blood for the blood is the life and thou mayest not eat the life with the flesh
thou shalt not eat it thou shalt pour it upon the earth as water
thou shalt not eat it that it may go well with thee and with thy children after thee when thou shalt do that which is right in the sight of the lord
only thy holy things which thou hast and thy vows thou shalt take and go unto the place which the lord shall choose
and thou shalt offer thy burnt offerings the flesh and the blood upon the altar of the lord thy god and the blood of thy sacrifices shall be poured out upon the altar of the lord thy god and thou shalt eat the flesh
observe and hear all these words which i command thee that it may go well with thee and with thy children after thee for ever when thou doest that which is good and right in the sight of the lord thy god
when the lord thy god shall cut off the nations from before thee whither thou goest to possess them and thou succeedest them and dwellest in their land
take heed to thyself that thou be not snared by following them after that they be destroyed from before thee and that thou enquire not after their gods saying how did these nations serve their gods even so will i do likewise
thou shalt not do so unto the lord thy god for every abomination to the lord which he hateth have they done unto their gods for even their sons and their daughters they have burnt in the fire to their gods
what thing soever i command you observe to do it thou shalt not add thereto nor diminish from it
if there arise among you a prophet or a dreamer of dreams and giveth thee a sign or a wonder
and the sign or the wonder come to pass whereof he spake unto thee saying let us go after other gods which thou hast not known and let us serve them
thou shalt not hearken unto the words of that prophet or that dreamer of dreams for the lord your god proveth you to know whether ye love the lord your god with all your heart and with all your soul
ye shall walk after the lord your god and fear him and keep his commandments and obey his voice and ye shall serve him and cleave unto him
and that prophet or that dreamer of dreams shall be put to death because he hath spoken to turn you away from the lord your god which brought you out of the land of egypt and redeemed you out of the house of bondage to thrust thee out of the way which the lord thy god commanded thee to walk in so shalt thou put the evil away from the midst of thee
if thy brother the son of thy mother or thy son or thy daughter or the wife of thy bosom or thy friend which is as thine own soul entice thee secretly saying let us go and serve other gods which thou hast not known thou nor thy fathers
namely of the gods of the people which are round about you nigh unto thee or far off from thee from the one end of the earth even unto the other end of the earth
thou shalt not consent unto him nor hearken unto him neither shall thine eye pity him neither shalt thou spare neither shalt thou conceal him
but thou shalt surely kill him thine hand shall be first upon him to put him to death and afterwards the hand of all the people
and thou shalt stone him with stones that he die because he hath sought to thrust thee away from the lord thy god which brought thee out of the land of egypt from the house of bondage
and all israel shall hear and fear and shall do no more any such wickedness as this is among you
if thou shalt hear say in one of thy cities which the lord thy god hath given thee to dwell there saying
certain men the children of belial are gone out from among you and have withdrawn the inhabitants of their city saying let us go and serve other gods which ye have not known
then shalt thou enquire and make search and ask diligently and behold if it be truth and the thing certain that such abomination is wrought among you
thou shalt surely smite the inhabitants of that city with the edge of the sword destroying it utterly and all that is therein and the cattle thereof with the edge of the sword
and thou shalt gather all the spoil of it into the midst of the street thereof and shalt burn with fire the city and all the spoil thereof every whit for the lord thy god and it shall be an heap for ever it shall not be built again
and there shall cleave nought of the cursed thing to thine hand that the lord may turn from the fierceness of his anger and shew thee mercy and have compassion upon thee and multiply thee as he hath sworn unto thy fathers
when thou shalt hearken to the voice of the lord thy god to keep all his commandments which i command thee this day to do that which is right in the eyes of the lord thy god
ye are the children of the lord your god ye shall not cut yourselves nor make any baldness between your eyes for the dead
for thou art an holy people unto the lord thy god and the lord hath chosen thee to be a peculiar people unto himself above all the nations that are upon the earth
thou shalt not eat any abominable thing
these are the beasts which ye shall eat the ox the sheep and the goat
the hart and the roebuck and the fallow deer and the wild goat and the pygarg and the wild ox and the chamois
and every beast that parteth the hoof and cleaveth the cleft into two claws and cheweth the cud among the beasts that ye shall eat
nevertheless these ye shall not eat of them that chew the cud or of them that divide the cloven hoof as the camel and the hare and the coney for they chew the cud but divide not the hoof therefore they are unclean unto you
and the swine because it divideth the hoof yet cheweth not the cud it is unclean unto you ye shall not eat of their flesh nor touch their dead carcase
these ye shall eat of all that are in the waters all that have fins and scales shall ye eat
and whatsoever hath not fins and scales ye may not eat it is unclean unto you

and if the way be too long for thee so that thou art not able to carry it or if the place be too far from thee which the lord thy god shall choose to set his name there when the lord thy god hath blessed thee
then shalt thou turn it into money and bind up the money in thine hand and shalt go unto the place which the lord thy god shall choose
and thou shalt bestow that money for whatsoever thy soul lusteth after for oxen or for sheep or for wine or for strong drink or for whatsoever thy soul desireth and thou shalt eat there before the lord thy god and thou shalt rejoice thou and thine household

and this is the manner of the release every creditor that lendeth ought unto his neighbour shall release it he shall not exact it of his neighbour or of his brother because it is called the lord's release
of a foreigner thou mayest exact it again but that which is thine with thy brother thine hand shall release
save when there shall be no poor among you for the lord shall greatly bless thee in the land which the lord thy god giveth thee for an inheritance to possess it

and hath gone and served other gods and worshipped them either the sun or moon or any of the host of heaven which i have not commanded
and it be told thee and thou hast heard of it and enquired diligently and behold it be true and the thing certain that such abomination is wrought in israel
