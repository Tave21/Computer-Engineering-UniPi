for the transgression of a land many are the princes thereof but by a man of understanding and knowledge the state thereof shall be prolonged
a poor man that oppresseth the poor is like a sweeping rain which leaveth no food
they that forsake the law praise the wicked but such as keep the law contend with them
evil men understand not judgment but they that seek the lord understand all things
better is the poor that walketh in his uprightness than he that is perverse in his ways though he be rich
whoso keepeth the law is a wise son but he that is a companion of riotous men shameth his father
he that by usury and unjust gain increaseth his substance he shall gather it for him that will pity the poor
he that turneth away his ear from hearing the law even his prayer shall be abomination
whoso causeth the righteous to go astray in an evil way he shall fall himself into his own pit but the upright shall have good things in possession
the rich man is wise in his own conceit but the poor that hath understanding searcheth him out
when righteous men do rejoice there is great glory but when the wicked rise a man is hidden
he that covereth his sins shall not prosper but whoso confesseth and forsaketh them shall have mercy
happy is the man that feareth alway but he that hardeneth his heart shall fall into mischief
as a roaring lion and a ranging bear so is a wicked ruler over the poor people
the prince that wanteth understanding is also a great oppressor but he that hateth covetousness shall prolong his days
a man that doeth violence to the blood of any person shall flee to the pit let no man stay him
whoso walketh uprightly shall be saved but he that is perverse in his ways shall fall at once
he that tilleth his land shall have plenty of bread but he that followeth after vain persons shall have poverty enough
a faithful man shall abound with blessings but he that maketh haste to be rich shall not be innocent
to have respect of persons is not good for for a piece of bread that man will transgress
he that hasteth to be rich hath an evil eye and considereth not that poverty shall come upon him
he that rebuketh a man afterwards shall find more favour than he that flattereth with the tongue
whoso robbeth his father or his mother and saith it is no transgression the same is the companion of a destroyer
he that is of a proud heart stirreth up strife but he that putteth his trust in the lord shall be made fat
he that trusteth in his own heart is a fool but whoso walketh wisely he shall be delivered
he that giveth unto the poor shall not lack but he that hideth his eyes shall have many a curse
when the wicked rise men hide themselves but when they perish the righteous increase
he that being often reproved hardeneth his neck shall suddenly be destroyed and that without remedy
when the righteous are in authority the people rejoice but when the wicked beareth rule the people mourn
whoso loveth wisdom rejoiceth his father but he that keepeth company with harlots spendeth his substance
the king by judgment establisheth the land but he that receiveth gifts overthroweth it
a man that flattereth his neighbour spreadeth a net for his feet
in the transgression of an evil man there is a snare but the righteous doth sing and rejoice
the righteous considereth the cause of the poor but the wicked regardeth not to know it
scornful men bring a city into a snare but wise men turn away wrath
if a wise man contendeth with a foolish man whether he rage or laugh there is no rest
the bloodthirsty hate the upright but the just seek his soul
a fool uttereth all his mind but a wise man keepeth it in till afterwards
if a ruler hearken to lies all his servants are wicked
the poor and the deceitful man meet together the lord lighteneth both their eyes
the king that faithfully judgeth the poor his throne shall be established for ever
the rod and reproof give wisdom but a child left to himself bringeth his mother to shame
when the wicked are multiplied transgression increaseth but the righteous shall see their fall
correct thy son and he shall give thee rest yea he shall give delight unto thy soul
where there is no vision the people perish but he that keepeth the law happy is he
a servant will not be corrected by words for though he understand he will not answer
seest thou a man that is hasty in his words there is more hope of a fool than of him
he that delicately bringeth up his servant from a child shall have him become his son at the length
an angry man stirreth up strife and a furious man aboundeth in transgression
a man's pride shall bring him low but honour shall uphold the humble in spirit
whoso is partner with a thief hateth his own soul he heareth cursing and bewrayeth it not
the fear of man bringeth a snare but whoso putteth his trust in the lord shall be safe
many seek the ruler's favour but every man's judgment cometh from the lord
an unjust man is an abomination to the just and he that is upright in the way is abomination to the wicked
the words of agur the son of jakeh even the prophecy the man spake unto ithiel even unto ithiel and ucal
surely i am more brutish than any man and have not the understanding of a man
i neither learned wisdom nor have the knowledge of the holy
who hath ascended up into heaven or descended who hath gathered the wind in his fists who hath bound the waters in a garment who hath established all the ends of the earth what is his name and what is his son's name if thou canst tell
every word of god is pure he is a shield unto them that put their trust in him
add thou not unto his words lest he reprove thee and thou be found a liar
two things have i required of thee deny me them not before i die
remove far from me vanity and lies give me neither poverty nor riches feed me with food convenient for me
lest i be full and deny thee and say who is the lord or lest i be poor and steal and take the name of my god in vain
accuse not a servant unto his master lest he curse thee and thou be found guilty
there is a generation that curseth their father and doth not bless their mother
there is a generation that are pure in their own eyes and yet is not washed from their filthiness
there is a generation o how lofty are their eyes and their eyelids are lifted up
there is a generation whose teeth are as swords and their jaw teeth as knives to devour the poor from off the earth and the needy from among men
the horseleach hath two daughters crying give give there are three things that are never satisfied yea four things say not it is enough
the grave and the barren womb the earth that is not filled with water and the fire that saith not it is enough
the eye that mocketh at his father and despiseth to obey his mother the ravens of the valley shall pick it out and the young eagles shall eat it
there be three things which are too wonderful for me yea four which i know not
the way of an eagle in the air the way of a serpent upon a rock the way of a ship in the midst of the sea and the way of a man with a maid
such is the way of an adulterous woman she eateth and wipeth her mouth and saith i have done no wickedness
for three things the earth is disquieted and for four which it cannot bear
for a servant when he reigneth and a fool when he is filled with meat
for an odious woman when she is married and an handmaid that is heir to her mistress
there be four things which are little upon the earth but they are exceeding wise
the ants are a people not strong yet they prepare their meat in the summer
the conies are but a feeble folk yet make they their houses in the rocks
the locusts have no king yet go they forth all of them by bands
the spider taketh hold with her hands and is in kings palaces
there be three things which go well yea four are comely in going
a lion which is strongest among beasts and turneth not away for any
a greyhound an he goat also and a king against whom there is no rising up
if thou hast done foolishly in lifting up thyself or if thou hast thought evil lay thine hand upon thy mouth
surely the churning of milk bringeth forth butter and the wringing of the nose bringeth forth blood so the forcing of wrath bringeth forth strife
the words of king lemuel the prophecy that his mother taught him
what my son and what the son of my womb and what the son of my vows
give not thy strength unto women nor thy ways to that which destroyeth kings
it is not for kings o lemuel it is not for kings to drink wine nor for princes strong drink
lest they drink and forget the law and pervert the judgment of any of the afflicted
give strong drink unto him that is ready to perish and wine unto those that be of heavy hearts
let him drink and forget his poverty and remember his misery no more
open thy mouth for the dumb in the cause of all such as are appointed to destruction
open thy mouth judge righteously and plead the cause of the poor and needy
who can find a virtuous woman for her price is far above rubies
the heart of her husband doth safely trust in her so that he shall have no need of spoil
she will do him good and not evil all the days of her life
she seeketh wool and flax and worketh willingly with her hands
she is like the merchants ships she bringeth her food from afar
she riseth also while it is yet night and giveth meat to her household and a portion to her maidens
she considereth a field and buyeth it with the fruit of her hands she planteth a vineyard
she girdeth her loins with strength and strengtheneth her arms
she perceiveth that her merchandise is good her candle goeth not out by night
she layeth her hands to the spindle and her hands hold the distaff
she stretcheth out her hand to the poor yea she reacheth forth her hands to the needy
she is not afraid of the snow for her household for all her household are clothed with scarlet
she maketh herself coverings of tapestry her clothing is silk and purple
her husband is known in the gates when he sitteth among the elders of the land
she maketh fine linen and selleth it and delivereth girdles unto the merchant
strength and honour are her clothing and she shall rejoice in time to come
she openeth her mouth with wisdom and in her tongue is the law of kindness
she looketh well to the ways of her household and eateth not the bread of idleness
her children arise up and call her blessed her husband also and he praiseth her
many daughters have done virtuously but thou excellest them all
favour is deceitful and beauty is vain but a woman that feareth the lord she shall be praised
give her of the fruit of her hands and let her own works praise her in the gates
the words of the preacher the son of david king in jerusalem
vanity of vanities saith the preacher vanity of vanities all is vanity
what profit hath a man of all his labour which he taketh under the sun
one generation passeth away and another generation cometh but the earth abideth for ever
the sun also ariseth and the sun goeth down and hasteth to his place where he arose
the wind goeth toward the south and turneth about unto the north it whirleth about continually and the wind returneth again according to his circuits
all the rivers run into the sea yet the sea is not full unto the place from whence the rivers come thither they return again
all things are full of labour man cannot utter it the eye is not satisfied with seeing nor the ear filled with hearing
the thing that hath been it is that which shall be and that which is done is that which shall be done and there is no new thing under the sun
is there any thing whereof it may be said see this is new it hath been already of old time which was before us
there is no remembrance of former things neither shall there be any remembrance of things that are to come with those that shall come after
i the preacher was king over israel in jerusalem
and i gave my heart to seek and search out by wisdom concerning all things that are done under heaven this sore travail hath god given to the sons of man to be exercised therewith
i have seen all the works that are done under the sun and behold all is vanity and vexation of spirit
that which is crooked cannot be made straight and that which is wanting cannot be numbered
i communed with mine own heart saying lo i am come to great estate and have gotten more wisdom than all they that have been before me in jerusalem yea my heart had great experience of wisdom and knowledge
and i gave my heart to know wisdom and to know madness and folly i perceived that this also is vexation of spirit
for in much wisdom is much grief and he that increaseth knowledge increaseth sorrow
i said in mine heart go to now i will prove thee with mirth therefore enjoy pleasure and behold this also is vanity
i said of laughter it is mad and of mirth what doeth it
i sought in mine heart to give myself unto wine yet acquainting mine heart with wisdom and to lay hold on folly till i might see what was that good for the sons of men which they should do under the heaven all the days of their life
i made me great works i builded me houses i planted me vineyards
i made me gardens and orchards and i planted trees in them of all kind of fruits
i made me pools of water to water therewith the wood that bringeth forth trees
i got me servants and maidens and had servants born in my house also i had great possessions of great and small cattle above all that were in jerusalem before me
i gathered me also silver and gold and the peculiar treasure of kings and of the provinces i gat me men singers and women singers and the delights of the sons of men as musical instruments and that of all sorts
so i was great and increased more than all that were before me in jerusalem also my wisdom remained with me
and whatsoever mine eyes desired i kept not from them i withheld not my heart from any joy for my heart rejoiced in all my labour and this was my portion of all my labour
then i looked on all the works that my hands had wrought and on the labour that i had laboured to do and behold all was vanity and vexation of spirit and there was no profit under the sun
and i turned myself to behold wisdom and madness and folly for what can the man do that cometh after the king even that which hath been already done
then i saw that wisdom excelleth folly as far as light excelleth darkness
the wise man's eyes are in his head but the fool walketh in darkness and i myself perceived also that one event happeneth to them all
then said i in my heart as it happeneth to the fool so it happeneth even to me and why was i then more wise then i said in my heart that this also is vanity
for there is no remembrance of the wise more than of the fool for ever seeing that which now is in the days to come shall all be forgotten and how dieth the wise man as the fool
therefore i hated life because the work that is wrought under the sun is grievous unto me for all is vanity and vexation of spirit
yea i hated all my labour which i had taken under the sun because i should leave it unto the man that shall be after me
and who knoweth whether he shall be a wise man or a fool yet shall he have rule over all my labour wherein i have laboured and wherein i have shewed myself wise under the sun this is also vanity
therefore i went about to cause my heart to despair of all the labour which i took under the sun
for there is a man whose labour is in wisdom and in knowledge and in equity yet to a man that hath not laboured therein shall he leave it for his portion this also is vanity and a great evil
for what hath man of all his labour and of the vexation of his heart wherein he hath laboured under the sun
for all his days are sorrows and his travail grief yea his heart taketh not rest in the night this is also vanity
there is nothing better for a man than that he should eat and drink and that he should make his soul enjoy good in his labour this also i saw that it was from the hand of god
for who can eat or who else can hasten hereunto more than i
for god giveth to a man that is good in his sight wisdom and knowledge and joy but to the sinner he giveth travail to gather and to heap up that he may give to him that is good before god this also is vanity and vexation of spirit
to every thing there is a season and a time to every purpose under the heaven
a time to be born and a time to die a time to plant and a time to pluck up that which is planted
a time to kill and a time to heal a time to break down and a time to build up
a time to weep and a time to laugh a time to mourn and a time to dance
a time to cast away stones and a time to gather stones together a time to embrace and a time to refrain from embracing
a time to get and a time to lose a time to keep and a time to cast away
a time to rend and a time to sew a time to keep silence and a time to speak
a time to love and a time to hate a time of war and a time of peace
what profit hath he that worketh in that wherein he laboureth
i have seen the travail which god hath given to the sons of men to be exercised in it
he hath made every thing beautiful in his time also he hath set the world in their heart so that no man can find out the work that god maketh from the beginning to the end
i know that there is no good in them but for a man to rejoice and to do good in his life
and also that every man should eat and drink and enjoy the good of all his labour it is the gift of god
i know that whatsoever god doeth it shall be for ever nothing can be put to it nor any thing taken from it and god doeth it that men should fear before him
that which hath been is now and that which is to be hath already been and god requireth that which is past
and moreover i saw under the sun the place of judgment that wickedness was there and the place of righteousness that iniquity was there
i said in mine heart god shall judge the righteous and the wicked for there is a time there for every purpose and for every work
i said in mine heart concerning the estate of the sons of men that god might manifest them and that they might see that they themselves are beasts
for that which befalleth the sons of men befalleth beasts even one thing befalleth them as the one dieth so dieth the other yea they have all one breath so that a man hath no preeminence above a beast for all is vanity
all go unto one place all are of the dust and all turn to dust again
who knoweth the spirit of man that goeth upward and the spirit of the beast that goeth downward to the earth
wherefore i perceive that there is nothing better than that a man should rejoice in his own works for that is his portion for who shall bring him to see what shall be after him
so i returned and considered all the oppressions that are done under the sun and behold the tears of such as were oppressed and they had no comforter and on the side of their oppressors there was power but they had no comforter
wherefore i praised the dead which are already dead more than the living which are yet alive
yea better is he than both they which hath not yet been who hath not seen the evil work that is done under the sun
again i considered all travail and every right work that for this a man is envied of his neighbour this is also vanity and vexation of spirit
the fool foldeth his hands together and eateth his own flesh
better is an handful with quietness than both the hands full with travail and vexation of spirit
then i returned and i saw vanity under the sun
there is one alone and there is not a second yea he hath neither child nor brother yet is there no end of all his labour neither is his eye satisfied with riches neither saith he for whom do i labour and bereave my soul of good this is also vanity yea it is a sore travail
two are better than one because they have a good reward for their labour
for if they fall the one will lift up his fellow but woe to him that is alone when he falleth for he hath not another to help him up
again if two lie together then they have heat but how can one be warm alone
and if one prevail against him two shall withstand him and a threefold cord is not quickly broken
better is a poor and a wise child than an old and foolish king who will no more be admonished
for out of prison he cometh to reign whereas also he that is born in his kingdom becometh poor
i considered all the living which walk under the sun with the second child that shall stand up in his stead
there is no end of all the people even of all that have been before them they also that come after shall not rejoice in him surely this also is vanity and vexation of spirit
