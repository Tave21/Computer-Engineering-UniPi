mercutio i mean sir in delay
 we waste our lights in vain like lamps by day
 take our good meaning for our judgment sits
 five times in that ere once in our five wits
romeo and we mean well in going to this mask
 but tis no wit to go
mercutio why may one ask
romeo i dream'd a dream tonight
mercutio and so did i
romeo well what was yours
mercutio that dreamers often lie
romeo in bed asleep while they do dream things true
mercutio o then i see queen mab hath been with you
 she is the fairies midwife and she comes
 in shape no bigger than an agatestone
 on the forefinger of an alderman
 drawn with a team of little atomies
 athwart men's noses as they lie asleep
 her wagonspokes made of long spiders legs
 the cover of the wings of grasshoppers
 the traces of the smallest spider's web
 the collars of the moonshine's watery beams
 her whip of cricket's bone the lash of film
 her wagoner a small greycoated gnat
 not so big as a round little worm
 prick'd from the lazy finger of a maid
 her chariot is an empty hazelnut
 made by the joiner squirrel or old grub
 time out o mind the fairies coachmakers
 and in this state she gallops night by night
 through lovers brains and then they dream of love
 o'er courtiers knees that dream on court'sies straight
 o'er lawyers fingers who straight dream on fees
 o'er ladies  lips who straight on kisses dream
 which oft the angry mab with blisters plagues
 because their breaths with sweetmeats tainted are
 sometime she gallops o'er a courtier's nose
 and then dreams he of smelling out a suit
 and sometime comes she with a tithepig's tail
 tickling a parson's nose as a lies asleep
 then dreams he of another benefice
 sometime she driveth o'er a soldier's neck
 and then dreams he of cutting foreign throats
 of breaches ambuscadoes spanish blades
 of healths fivefathom deep and then anon
 drums in his ear at which he starts and wakes
 and being thus frighted swears a prayer or two
 and sleeps again this is that very mab
 that plats the manes of horses in the night
 and bakes the elflocks in foul sluttish hairs
 which once untangled much misfortune bodes
 this is the hag when maids lie on their backs
 that presses them and learns them first to bear
 making them women of good carriage
 this is she
romeo peace peace mercutio peace
 thou talk'st of nothing
mercutio true i talk of dreams
 which are the children of an idle brain
 begot of nothing but vain fantasy
 which is as thin of substance as the air
 and more inconstant than the wind who wooes
 even now the frozen bosom of the north
 and being anger'd puffs away from thence
 turning his face to the dewdropping south
benvolio this wind you talk of blows us from ourselves
 supper is done and we shall come too late
romeo i fear too early for my mind misgives
 some consequence yet hanging in the stars
 shall bitterly begin his fearful date
 with this night's revels and expire the term
 of a despised life closed in my breast
 by some vile forfeit of untimely death
 but he that hath the steerage of my course
 direct my sail on lusty gentlemen
benvolio strike drum
 exeunt
 romeo and juliet
act i
scene v a hall in capulet's house
 musicians waiting enter servingmen with napkins
first servant where's potpan that he helps not to take away he
 shift a trencher he scrape a trencher
second servant when good manners shall lie all in one or two men's
 hands and they unwashed too tis a foul thing
first servant away with the jointstools remove the
 courtcupboard look to the plate good thou save

 the porter let in susan grindstone and nell
 antony and potpan
second servant ay boy ready
first servant you are looked for and called for asked for and
 sought for in the great chamber
second servant we cannot be here and there too cheerly boys be
 brisk awhile and the longer liver take all
 enter capulet with juliet and others of his house
 meeting the guests and maskers
capulet welcome gentlemen ladies that have their toes
 unplagued with corns will have a bout with you
 ah ha my mistresses which of you all
 will now deny to dance she that makes dainty
 she i'll swear hath corns am i come near ye now
 welcome gentlemen i have seen the day
 that i have worn a visor and could tell
 a whispering tale in a fair lady's ear
 such as would please tis gone tis gone tis gone
 you are welcome gentlemen come musicians play
 a hall a hall give room and foot it girls
 music plays and they dance
 more light you knaves and turn the tables up
 and quench the fire the room is grown too hot
 ah sirrah this unlook'dfor sport comes well
 nay sit nay sit good cousin capulet
 for you and i are past our dancing days
 how long is't now since last yourself and i
 were in a mask
second capulet by'r lady thirty years
capulet what man tis not so much tis not so much
 tis since the nuptials of lucentio
 come pentecost as quickly as it will
 some five and twenty years and then we mask'd
second capulet tis more tis more his son is elder sir
 his son is thirty
capulet will you tell me that
 his son was but a ward two years ago
romeo to a servingman what lady is that which doth
 enrich the hand
 of yonder knight
servant i know not sir
romeo o she doth teach the torches to burn bright
 it seems she hangs upon the cheek of night
 like a rich jewel in an ethiope's ear
 beauty too rich for use for earth too dear
 so shows a snowy dove trooping with crows
 as yonder lady o'er her fellows shows
 the measure done i'll watch her place of stand
 and touching hers make blessed my rude hand
 did my heart love till now forswear it sight
 for i ne'er saw true beauty till this night
tybalt this by his voice should be a montague
 fetch me my rapier boy what dares the slave
 come hither cover'd with an antic face
 to fleer and scorn at our solemnity
 now by the stock and honour of my kin
 to strike him dead i hold it not a sin
capulet why how now kinsman wherefore storm you so
tybalt uncle this is a montague our foe
 a villain that is hither come in spite
 to scorn at our solemnity this night
capulet young romeo is it
tybalt tis he that villain romeo
capulet content thee gentle coz let him alone
 he bears him like a portly gentleman
 and to say truth verona brags of him
 to be a virtuous and wellgovern'd youth
 i would not for the wealth of all the town
 here in my house do him disparagement
 therefore be patient take no note of him
 it is my will the which if thou respect
 show a fair presence and put off these frowns
 and illbeseeming semblance for a feast
tybalt it fits when such a villain is a guest
 i'll not endure him
capulet he shall be endured
 what goodman boy i say he shall go to
 am i the master here or you go to
 you'll not endure him god shall mend my soul
 you'll make a mutiny among my guests
 you will set cockahoop you'll be the man
tybalt why uncle tis a shame
capulet go to go to
 you are a saucy boy is't so indeed
 this trick may chance to scathe you i know what
 you must contrary me marry tis time
 well said my hearts you are a princox go
 be quiet ormore light more light for shame
 i'll make you quiet what cheerly my hearts
tybalt patience perforce with wilful choler meeting
 makes my flesh tremble in their different greeting
 i will withdraw but this intrusion shall
 now seeming sweet convert to bitter gall
 exit
romeo to juliet if i profane with my unworthiest hand
 this holy shrine the gentle fine is this
 my lips two blushing pilgrims ready stand
 to smooth that rough touch with a tender kiss
juliet good pilgrim you do wrong your hand too much
 which mannerly devotion shows in this
 for saints have hands that pilgrims hands do touch
 and palm to palm is holy palmers kiss
romeo have not saints lips and holy palmers too
juliet ay pilgrim lips that they must use in prayer
romeo o then dear saint let lips do what hands do
 they pray grant thou lest faith turn to despair
juliet saints do not move though grant for prayers sake
romeo then move not while my prayer's effect i take
 thus from my lips by yours my sin is purged
juliet then have my lips the sin that they have took
romeo sin from thy lips o trespass sweetly urged
 give me my sin again
