which to his speech did honey passage yield
like a red morn that ever yet betoken'd
wreck to the seaman tempest to the field
sorrow to shepherds woe unto the birds
gusts and foul flaws to herdmen and to herds
this ill presage advisedly she marketh
even as the wind is hush'd before it raineth
or as the wolf doth grin before he barketh
or as the berry breaks before it staineth
or like the deadly bullet of a gun
his meaning struck her ere his words begun
and at his look she flatly falleth down
for looks kill love and love by looks reviveth
a smile recures the wounding of a frown
but blessed bankrupt that by love so thriveth
the silly boy believing she is dead
claps her pale cheek till clapping makes it red
and all amazed brake off his late intent
for sharply he did think to reprehend her
which cunning love did wittily prevent
fair fall the wit that can so well defend her
for on the grass she lies as she were slain
till his breath breatheth life in her again
he wrings her nose he strikes her on the cheeks
he bends her fingers holds her pulses hard
he chafes her lips a thousand ways he seeks
to mend the hurt that his unkindness marr'd
he kisses her and she by her good will
will never rise so he will kiss her still
the night of sorrow now is turn'd to day
her two blue windows faintly she upheaveth
like the fair sun when in his fresh array
he cheers the morn and all the earth relieveth
and as the bright sun glorifies the sky
so is her face illumined with her eye
whose beams upon his hairless face are fix'd
as if from thence they borrow'd all their shine
were never four such lamps together mix'd
had not his clouded with his brow's repine
but hers which through the crystal tears gave light
shone like the moon in water seen by night
'o where am i quoth she in earth or heaven
or in the ocean drench'd or in the fire
what hour is this or morn or weary even
do i delight to die or life desire
but now i lived and life was death's annoy
but now i died and death was lively joy
'o thou didst kill me kill me once again
thy eyes shrewd tutor that hard heart of thine
hath taught them scornful tricks and such disdain
that they have murder'd this poor heart of mine
and these mine eyes true leaders to their queen
but for thy piteous lips no more had seen
'long may they kiss each other for this cure
o never let their crimson liveries wear
and as they last their verdure still endure
to drive infection from the dangerous year
that the stargazers having writ on death
may say the plague is banish'd by thy breath
'pure lips sweet seals in my soft lips imprinted
what bargains may i make still to be sealing
to sell myself i can be well contented
so thou wilt buy and pay and use good dealing
which purchase if thou make for fear of slips
set thy sealmanual on my waxred lips
'a thousand kisses buys my heart from me
and pay them at thy leisure one by one
what is ten hundred touches unto thee
are they not quickly told and quickly gone
say for nonpayment that the debt should double
is twenty hundred kisses such a trouble
'fair queen quoth he if any love you owe me
measure my strangeness with my unripe years
before i know myself seek not to know me
no fisher but the ungrown fry forbears
the mellow plum doth fall the green sticks fast
or being early pluck'd is sour to taste
'look the world's comforter with weary gait
his day's hot task hath ended in the west
the owl night's herald shrieks 'tis very late'
the sheep are gone to fold birds to their nest
and coalblack clouds that shadow heaven's light
do summon us to part and bid good night
'now let me say good night and so say you
if you will say so you shall have a kiss'
'good night quoth she and ere he says adieu'
the honey fee of parting tender'd is
her arms do lend his neck a sweet embrace
incorporate then they seem face grows to face
till breathless he disjoin'd and backward drew
the heavenly moisture that sweet coral mouth
whose precious taste her thirsty lips well knew
whereon they surfeit yet complain on drouth
he with her plenty press'd she faint with dearth
their lips together glued fall to the earth
now quick desire hath caught the yielding prey
and gluttonlike she feeds yet never filleth
her lips are conquerors his lips obey
paying what ransom the insulter willeth
whose vulture thought doth pitch the price so high
that she will draw his lips rich treasure dry
and having felt the sweetness of the spoil
with blindfold fury she begins to forage
her face doth reek and smoke her blood doth boil
and careless lust stirs up a desperate courage
planting oblivion beating reason back
forgetting shame's pure blush and honour's wrack
hot faint and weary with her hard embracing
like a wild bird being tamed with too much handling
or as the fleetfoot roe that's tired with chasing
or like the froward infant still'd with dandling
he now obeys and now no more resisteth
while she takes all she can not all she listeth
what wax so frozen but dissolves with tempering
and yields at last to every light impression
things out of hope are compass'd oft with venturing
chiefly in love whose leave exceeds commission
affection faints not like a palefaced coward
but then woos best when most his choice is froward
when he did frown o had she then gave over
such nectar from his lips she had not suck'd
foul words and frowns must not repel a lover
what though the rose have prickles yet tis pluck'd
were beauty under twenty locks kept fast
yet love breaks through and picks them all at last
for pity now she can no more detain him
the poor fool prays her that he may depart
she is resolved no longer to restrain him
bids him farewell and look well to her heart
the which by cupid's bow she doth protest
he carries thence incaged in his breast
'sweet boy she says this night i'll waste in sorrow
for my sick heart commands mine eyes to watch
tell me love's master shall we meet tomorrow
say shall we shall we wilt thou make the match'
he tells her no tomorrow he intends
to hunt the boar with certain of his friends
'the boar quoth she whereat a sudden pale
like lawn being spread upon the blushing rose
usurps her cheek she trembles at his tale
and on his neck her yoking arms she throws
she sinketh down still hanging by his neck
he on her belly falls she on her back
now is she in the very lists of love
her champion mounted for the hot encounter
all is imaginary she doth prove
he will not manage her although he mount her
that worse than tantalus is her annoy
to clip elysium and to lack her joy
even as poor birds deceived with painted grapes
do surfeit by the eye and pine the maw
even so she languisheth in her mishaps
as those poor birds that helpless berries saw
the warm effects which she in him finds missing
she seeks to kindle with continual kissing
but all in vain good queen it will not be
she hath assay'd as much as may be proved
her pleading hath deserved a greater fee
she's love she loves and yet she is not loved
'fie fie he says you crush me let me go
you have no reason to withhold me so'
'thou hadst been gone quoth she sweet boy ere this
but that thou told'st me thou wouldst hunt the boar
o be advised thou know'st not what it is
with javelin's point a churlish swine to gore
whose tushes never sheathed he whetteth still
like to a mortal butcher bent to kill
'on his bowback he hath a battle set
of bristly pikes that ever threat his foes
his eyes like glowworms shine when he doth fret
his snout digs sepulchres where'er he goes
being moved he strikes whate'er is in his way
and whom he strikes his cruel tushes slay
'his brawny sides with hairy bristles arm'd
are better proof than thy spear's point can enter
his short thick neck cannot be easily harm'd
being ireful on the lion he will venture
the thorny brambles and embracing bushes
as fearful of him part through whom he rushes
'alas he nought esteems that face of thine
to which love's eyes pay tributary gazes
nor thy soft hands sweet lips and crystal eyne
whose full perfection all the world amazes
but having thee at vantagewondrous dread
would root these beauties as he roots the mead
'o let him keep his loathsome cabin still
beauty hath nought to do with such foul fiends
come not within his danger by thy will
they that thrive well take counsel of their friends
when thou didst name the boar not to dissemble
i fear'd thy fortune and my joints did tremble
'didst thou not mark my face was it not white
saw'st thou not signs of fear lurk in mine eye
grew i not faint and fell i not downright
within my bosom whereon thou dost lie
my boding heart pants beats and takes no rest
but like an earthquake shakes thee on my breast
'for where love reigns disturbing jealousy
doth call himself affection's sentinel
gives false alarms suggesteth mutiny
