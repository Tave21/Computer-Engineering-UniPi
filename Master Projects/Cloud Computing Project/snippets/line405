 estimations the one is but frail and the other
 casual a cunning thief or a that way accomplished
 courtier would hazard the winning both of first and last
posthumus leonatus your italy contains none so accomplished a courtier
 to convince the honour of my mistress if in the
 holding or loss of that you term her frail i do
 nothing doubt you have store of thieves
 notwithstanding i fear not my ring
philario let us leave here gentlemen
posthumus leonatus sir with all my heart this worthy signior i
 thank him makes no stranger of me we are familiar at first
iachimo with five times so much conversation i should get
 ground of your fair mistress make her go back even
 to the yielding had i admittance and opportunity to friend
posthumus leonatus no no
iachimo i dare thereupon pawn the moiety of my estate to
 your ring which in my opinion o'ervalues it
 something but i make my wager rather against your
 confidence than her reputation and to bar your
 offence herein too i durst attempt it against any
 lady in the world
posthumus leonatus you are a great deal abused in too bold a
 persuasion and i doubt not you sustain what you're
 worthy of by your attempt
iachimo what's that
posthumus leonatus a repulse though your attempt as you call it
 deserve more a punishment too
philario gentlemen enough of this it came in too suddenly
 let it die as it was born and i pray you be
 better acquainted
iachimo would i had put my estate and my neighbour's on the
 approbation of what i have spoke
posthumus leonatus what lady would you choose to assail
iachimo yours whom in constancy you think stands so safe
 i will lay you ten thousand ducats to your ring
 that commend me to the court where your lady is
 with no more advantage than the opportunity of a
 second conference and i will bring from thence
 that honour of hers which you imagine so reserved
posthumus leonatus i will wage against your gold gold to it my ring
 i hold dear as my finger tis part of it
iachimo you are afraid and therein the wiser if you buy
 ladies flesh at a million a dram you cannot
 preserve it from tainting but i see you have some
 religion in you that you fear
posthumus leonatus this is but a custom in your tongue you bear a
 graver purpose i hope
iachimo i am the master of my speeches and would undergo
 what's spoken i swear
posthumus leonatus will you i shall but lend my diamond till your
 return let there be covenants drawn between's my
 mistress exceeds in goodness the hugeness of your
 unworthy thinking i dare you to this match here's my ring
philario i will have it no lay
iachimo by the gods it is one if i bring you no
 sufficient testimony that i have enjoyed the dearest
 bodily part of your mistress my ten thousand ducats
 are yours so is your diamond too if i come off
 and leave her in such honour as you have trust in
 she your jewel this your jewel and my gold are
 yours provided i have your commendation for my more
 free entertainment
posthumus leonatus i embrace these conditions let us have articles
 betwixt us only thus far you shall answer if
 you make your voyage upon her and give me directly
 to understand you have prevailed i am no further
 your enemy she is not worth our debate if she
 remain unseduced you not making it appear
 otherwise for your ill opinion and the assault you
 have made to her chastity you shall answer me with
 your sword
iachimo your hand a covenant we will have these things set
 down by lawful counsel and straight away for
 britain lest the bargain should catch cold and
 starve i will fetch my gold and have our two
 wagers recorded
posthumus leonatus agreed
 exeunt posthumus leonatus and iachimo
frenchman will this hold think you
philario signior iachimo will not from it
 pray let us follow em
 exeunt
 cymbeline
act i
scene v britain a room in cymbeline's palace
 enter queen ladies and cornelius
queen whiles yet the dew's on ground gather those flowers
 make haste who has the note of them
first lady i madam
queen dispatch
 exeunt ladies
 now master doctor have you brought those drugs
cornelius pleaseth your highness ay here they are madam
 presenting a small box
 but i beseech your grace without offence
 my conscience bids me askwherefore you have
 commanded of me those most poisonous compounds
 which are the movers of a languishing death
 but though slow deadly
queen i wonder doctor
 thou ask'st me such a question have i not been
 thy pupil long hast thou not learn'd me how
 to make perfumes distil preserve yea so
 that our great king himself doth woo me oft
 for my confections having thus far proceeded
 unless thou think'st me devilishis't not meet
 that i did amplify my judgment in
 other conclusions i will try the forces
 of these thy compounds on such creatures as
 we count not worth the hanging but none human
 to try the vigour of them and apply
 allayments to their act and by them gather
 their several virtues and effects
cornelius your highness
 shall from this practise but make hard your heart
 besides the seeing these effects will be
 both noisome and infectious
queen o content thee
 enter pisanio
 aside
 here comes a flattering rascal upon him
 will i first work he's for his master
 an enemy to my son how now pisanio
 doctor your service for this time is ended
 take your own way
cornelius aside i do suspect you madam
 but you shall do no harm
queen to pisanio hark thee a word
cornelius aside i do not like her she doth think she has
 strange lingering poisons i do know her spirit
 and will not trust one of her malice with
 a drug of such damn'd nature those she has
 will stupefy and dull the sense awhile
 which first perchance she'll prove on
 cats and dogs
 then afterward up higher but there is
 no danger in what show of death it makes
 more than the lockingup the spirits a time
 to be more fresh reviving she is fool'd
 with a most false effect and i the truer
 so to be false with her
queen no further service doctor
 until i send for thee
cornelius i humbly take my leave
 exit
queen weeps she still say'st thou dost thou think in time
 she will not quench and let instructions enter
 where folly now possesses do thou work
 when thou shalt bring me word she loves my son
 i'll tell thee on the instant thou art then
 as great as is thy master greater for
 his fortunes all lie speechless and his name
 is at last gasp return he cannot nor
 continue where he is to shift his being
 is to exchange one misery with another
 and every day that comes comes to decay
 a day's work in him what shalt thou expect
 to be depender on a thing that leans
 who cannot be new built nor has no friends
 so much as but to prop him
 the queen drops the box pisanio takes it up
 thou takest up
 thou know'st not what but take it for thy labour
 it is a thing i made which hath the king
 five times redeem'd from death i do not know
 what is more cordial nay i prethee take it
 it is an earnest of a further good
 that i mean to thee tell thy mistress how
 the case stands with her do't as from thyself
 think what a chance thou changest on but think
 thou hast thy mistress still to boot my son
 who shall take notice of thee i'll move the king
 to any shape of thy preferment such
 as thou'lt desire and then myself i chiefly
 that set thee on to this desert am bound
 to load thy merit richly call my women
 think on my words
 exit pisanio
 a sly and constant knave
 not to be shaked the agent for his master
 and the remembrancer of her to hold
 the handfast to her lord i have given him that
 which if he take shall quite unpeople her
 of liegers for her sweet and which she after
 except she bend her humour shall be assured
 to taste of too
 reenter pisanio and ladies
 so so well done well done
 the violets cowslips and the primroses
 bear to my closet fare thee well pisanio
 think on my words
 exeunt queen and ladies
pisanio and shall do
 but when to my good lord i prove untrue
 i'll choke myself there's all i'll do for you
