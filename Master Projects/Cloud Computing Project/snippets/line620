 all westward wales beyond the severn shore
 and all the fertile land within that bound
 to owen glendower and dear coz to you
 the remnant northward lying off from trent
 and our indentures tripartite are drawn
 which being sealed interchangeably
 a business that this night may execute
 tomorrow cousin percy you and i
 and my good lord of worcester will set forth
 to meet your father and the scottish power
 as is appointed us at shrewsbury
 my father glendower is not ready yet
 not shall we need his help these fourteen days
 within that space you may have drawn together
 your tenants friends and neighbouring gentlemen
glendower a shorter time shall send me to you lords
 and in my conduct shall your ladies come
 from whom you now must steal and take no leave
 for there will be a world of water shed
 upon the parting of your wives and you
hotspur methinks my moiety north from burton here
 in quantity equals not one of yours
 see how this river comes me cranking in
 and cuts me from the best of all my land
 a huge halfmoon a monstrous cantle out
 i'll have the current in this place damm'd up
 and here the smug and silver trent shall run
 in a new channel fair and evenly
 it shall not wind with such a deep indent
 to rob me of so rich a bottom here
glendower not wind it shall it must you see it doth
mortimer yea but
 mark how he bears his course and runs me up
 with like advantage on the other side
 gelding the opposed continent as much
 as on the other side it takes from you
earl of worcester yea but a little charge will trench him here
 and on this north side win this cape of land
 and then he runs straight and even
hotspur i'll have it so a little charge will do it
glendower i'll not have it alter'd
hotspur will not you
glendower no nor you shall not
hotspur who shall say me nay
glendower why that will i
hotspur let me not understand you then speak it in welsh
glendower i can speak english lord as well as you
 for i was train'd up in the english court
 where being but young i framed to the harp
 many an english ditty lovely well
 and gave the tongue a helpful ornament
 a virtue that was never seen in you
hotspur marry
 and i am glad of it with all my heart
 i had rather be a kitten and cry mew
 than one of these same metre balladmongers
 i had rather hear a brazen canstick turn'd
 or a dry wheel grate on the axletree
 and that would set my teeth nothing on edge
 nothing so much as mincing poetry
 tis like the forced gait of a shuffling nag
glendower come you shall have trent turn'd
hotspur i do not care i'll give thrice so much land
 to any welldeserving friend
 but in the way of bargain mark ye me
 i'll cavil on the ninth part of a hair
 are the indentures drawn shall we be gone
glendower the moon shines fair you may away by night
 i'll haste the writer and withal
 break with your wives of your departure hence
 i am afraid my daughter will run mad
 so much she doteth on her mortimer
 exit glendower
mortimer fie cousin percy how you cross my father
hotspur i cannot choose sometime he angers me
 with telling me of the mouldwarp and the ant
 of the dreamer merlin and his prophecies
 and of a dragon and a finless fish
 a clipwing'd griffin and a moulten raven
 a couching lion and a ramping cat
 and such a deal of skimbleskamble stuff
 as puts me from my faith i tell you what
 he held me last night at least nine hours
 in reckoning up the several devils names
 that were his lackeys i cried hum and well go to'
 but mark'd him not a word o he is as tedious
 as a tired horse a railing wife
 worse than a smoky house i had rather live
 with cheese and garlic in a windmill far
 than feed on cates and have him talk to me
 in any summerhouse in christendom
mortimer in faith he is a worthy gentleman
 exceedingly well read and profited
 in strange concealments valiant as a lion
 and as wondrous affable and as bountiful
 as mines of india shall i tell you cousin
 he holds your temper in a high respect
 and curbs himself even of his natural scope
 when you come cross his humour faith he does
 i warrant you that man is not alive
 might so have tempted him as you have done
 without the taste of danger and reproof
 but do not use it oft let me entreat you
earl of worcester in faith my lord you are too wilfulblame
 and since your coming hither have done enough
 to put him quite beside his patience
 you must needs learn lord to amend this fault
 though sometimes it show greatness courage blood
 and that's the dearest grace it renders you
 yet oftentimes it doth present harsh rage
 defect of manners want of government
 pride haughtiness opinion and disdain
 the least of which haunting a nobleman
 loseth men's hearts and leaves behind a stain
 upon the beauty of all parts besides
 beguiling them of commendation
hotspur well i am school'd good manners be your speed
 here come our wives and let us take our leave
 reenter glendower with the ladies
mortimer this is the deadly spite that angers me
 my wife can speak no english i no welsh
glendower my daughter weeps she will not part with you
 she'll be a soldier too she'll to the wars
mortimer good father tell her that she and my aunt percy
 shall follow in your conduct speedily
 glendower speaks to her in welsh and she
 answers him in the same
glendower she is desperate here a peevish selfwind harlotry
 one that no persuasion can do good upon
 the lady speaks in welsh
mortimer i understand thy looks that pretty welsh
 which thou pour'st down from these swelling heavens
 i am too perfect in and but for shame
 in such a parley should i answer thee
 the lady speaks again in welsh
 i understand thy kisses and thou mine
 and that's a feeling disputation
 but i will never be a truant love
 till i have learned thy language for thy tongue
 makes welsh as sweet as ditties highly penn'd
 sung by a fair queen in a summer's bower
 with ravishing division to her lute
glendower nay if you melt then will she run mad
 the lady speaks again in welsh
mortimer o i am ignorance itself in this
glendower she bids you on the wanton rushes lay you down
 and rest your gentle head upon her lap
 and she will sing the song that pleaseth you
 and on your eyelids crown the god of sleep
 charming your blood with pleasing heaviness
 making such difference twixt wake and sleep
 as is the difference betwixt day and night
 the hour before the heavenlyharness'd team
 begins his golden progress in the east
mortimer with all my heart i'll sit and hear her sing
 by that time will our book i think be drawn
glendower do so
 and those musicians that shall play to you
 hang in the air a thousand leagues from hence
 and straight they shall be here sit and attend
hotspur come kate thou art perfect in lying down come
 quick quick that i may lay my head in thy lap
lady percy go ye giddy goose
 the music plays
hotspur now i perceive the devil understands welsh
 and tis no marvel he is so humorous
 by'r lady he is a good musician
lady percy then should you be nothing but musical for you are
 altogether governed by humours lie still ye thief
 and hear the lady sing in welsh
hotspur i had rather hear lady my brach howl in irish
lady percy wouldst thou have thy head broken
hotspur no
lady percy then be still
hotspur neither'tis a woman's fault
lady percy now god help thee
hotspur to the welsh lady's bed
lady percy what's that
hotspur peace she sings
 here the lady sings a welsh song
hotspur come kate i'll have your song too
lady percy not mine in good sooth
hotspur not yours in good sooth heart you swear like a
 comfitmaker's wife not you in good sooth and
 as true as i live and as god shall mend me and
 as sure as day'
 and givest such sarcenet surety for thy oaths
 as if thou never walk'st further than finsbury
 swear me kate like a lady as thou art
 a good mouthfilling oath and leave in sooth'
 and such protest of peppergingerbread
 to velvetguards and sundaycitizens
 come sing
lady percy i will not sing
hotspur tis the next way to turn tailor or be redbreast
 teacher an the indentures be drawn i'll away
 within these two hours and so come in when ye will
 exit
glendower come come lord mortimer you are as slow
 as hot lord percy is on fire to go
