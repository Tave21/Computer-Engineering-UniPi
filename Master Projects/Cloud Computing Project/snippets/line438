adriano de armado i will kiss thy royal finger and take leave i am
 a votary i have vowed to jaquenetta to hold the
 plough for her sweet love three years but most
 esteemed greatness will you hear the dialogue that

 owl and the cuckoo it should have followed in the
 end of our show
ferdinand call them forth quickly we will do so
don
adriano de armado holla approach
 reenter holofernes sir nathaniel moth costard
 and others
 this side is hiems winter this ver the spring
 the one maintained by the owl the other by the
 cuckoo ver begin
 the song
 
 spring
 when daisies pied and violets blue
 and ladysmocks all silverwhite
 and cuckoobuds of yellow hue
 do paint the meadows with delight
 the cuckoo then on every tree
 mocks married men for thus sings he cuckoo
 cuckoo cuckoo o word of fear
 unpleasing to a married ear
 when shepherds pipe on oaten straws
 and merry larks are ploughmen's clocks
 when turtles tread and rooks and daws
 and maidens bleach their summer smocks
 the cuckoo then on every tree
 mocks married men for thus sings he cuckoo
 cuckoo cuckoo o word of fear
 unpleasing to a married ear
 
 winter
 when icicles hang by the wall
 and dick the shepherd blows his nail
 and tom bears logs into the hall
 and milk comes frozen home in pail
 when blood is nipp'd and ways be foul
 then nightly sings the staring owl tuwhit
 tuwho a merry note
 while greasy joan doth keel the pot
 when all aloud the wind doth blow
 and coughing drowns the parson's saw
 and birds sit brooding in the snow
 and marian's nose looks red and raw
 when roasted crabs hiss in the bowl
 then nightly sings the staring owl tuwhit
 tuwho a merry note
 while greasy joan doth keel the pot

 attendants
duke vincentio escalus
escalus my lord
duke vincentio of government the properties to unfold
 would seem in me to affect speech and discourse
 since i am put to know that your own science
 exceeds in that the lists of all advice
 my strength can give you then no more remains
 but that to your sufficiency 
 as your worth is able
 and let them work the nature of our people
 our city's institutions and the terms
 for common justice you're as pregnant in
 as art and practise hath enriched any
 that we remember there is our commission
 from which we would not have you warp call hither
 i say bid come before us angelo
 exit an attendant
 what figure of us think you he will bear
 for you must know we have with special soul
 elected him our absence to supply
 lent him our terror dress'd him with our love
 and given his deputation all the organs
 of our own power what think you of it
escalus if any in vienna be of worth
 to undergo such ample grace and honour
 it is lord angelo
duke vincentio look where he comes
 enter angelo
angelo always obedient to your grace's will
 i come to know your pleasure
duke vincentio angelo
 there is a kind of character in thy life
 that to the observer doth thy history
 fully unfold thyself and thy belongings
 are not thine own so proper as to waste
 thyself upon thy virtues they on thee
 heaven doth with us as we with torches do
 not light them for themselves for if our virtues
 did not go forth of us twere all alike
 as if we had them not spirits are not finely touch'd
 but to fine issues nor nature never lends
 the smallest scruple of her excellence
 but like a thrifty goddess she determines
 herself the glory of a creditor
 both thanks and use but i do bend my speech
 to one that can my part in him advertise
 hold therefore angelo
 in our remove be thou at full ourself
 mortality and mercy in vienna
 live in thy tongue and heart old escalus
 though first in question is thy secondary
 take thy commission
angelo now good my lord
 let there be some more test made of my metal
 before so noble and so great a figure
 be stamp'd upon it
duke vincentio no more evasion
 we have with a leaven'd and prepared choice
 proceeded to you therefore take your honours
 our haste from hence is of so quick condition
 that it prefers itself and leaves unquestion'd
 matters of needful value we shall write to you
 as time and our concernings shall importune
 how it goes with us and do look to know
 what doth befall you here so fare you well
 to the hopeful execution do i leave you
 of your commissions
angelo yet give leave my lord
 that we may bring you something on the way
duke vincentio my haste may not admit it
 nor need you on mine honour have to do
 with any scruple your scope is as mine own
 so to enforce or qualify the laws
 as to your soul seems good give me your hand
 i'll privily away i love the people
 but do not like to stage me to their eyes
 through it do well i do not relish well
 their loud applause and aves vehement
 nor do i think the man of safe discretion
 that does affect it once more fare you well
angelo the heavens give safety to your purposes
escalus lead forth and bring you back in happiness
duke i thank you fare you well
 exit
escalus i shall desire you sir to give me leave
 to have free speech with you and it concerns me
 to look into the bottom of my place
 a power i have but of what strength and nature
 i am not yet instructed
angelo tis so with me let us withdraw together
 and we may soon our satisfaction have
 touching that point
escalus i'll wait upon your honour
