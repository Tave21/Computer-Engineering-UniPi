constance what should he say but as the cardinal
lewis bethink you father for the difference
 is purchase of a heavy curse from rome
 or the light loss of england for a friend
 forego the easier
blanch that's the curse of rome
constance o lewis stand fast the devil tempts thee here
 in likeness of a new untrimmed bride
blanch the lady constance speaks not from her faith
 but from her need
constance o if thou grant my need
 which only lives but by the death of faith
 that need must needs infer this principle
 that faith would live again by death of need
 o then tread down my need and faith mounts up
 keep my need up and faith is trodden down
king john the king is moved and answers not to this
constance o be removed from him and answer well
austria do so king philip hang no more in doubt
bastard hang nothing but a calf'sskin most sweet lout
king philip i am perplex'd and know not what to say
cardinal pandulph what canst thou say but will perplex thee more
 if thou stand excommunicate and cursed
king philip good reverend father make my person yours
 and tell me how you would bestow yourself
 this royal hand and mine are newly knit
 and the conjunction of our inward souls
 married in league coupled and linked together
 with all religious strength of sacred vows
 the latest breath that gave the sound of words
 was deepsworn faith peace amity true love
 between our kingdoms and our royal selves
 and even before this truce but new before
 no longer than we well could wash our hands
 to clap this royal bargain up of peace
 heaven knows they were besmear'd and overstain'd
 with slaughter's pencil where revenge did paint
 the fearful difference of incensed kings
 and shall these hands so lately purged of blood
 so newly join'd in love so strong in both
 unyoke this seizure and this kind regreet
 play fast and loose with faith so jest with heaven
 make such unconstant children of ourselves
 as now again to snatch our palm from palm
 unswear faith sworn and on the marriagebed
 of smiling peace to march a bloody host
 and make a riot on the gentle brow
 of true sincerity o holy sir
 my reverend father let it not be so
 out of your grace devise ordain impose
 some gentle order and then we shall be blest
 to do your pleasure and continue friends
cardinal pandulph all form is formless order orderless
 save what is opposite to england's love
 therefore to arms be champion of our church
 or let the church our mother breathe her curse
 a mother's curse on her revolting son
 france thou mayst hold a serpent by the tongue
 a chafed lion by the mortal paw
 a fasting tiger safer by the tooth
 than keep in peace that hand which thou dost hold
king philip i may disjoin my hand but not my faith
cardinal pandulph so makest thou faith an enemy to faith
 and like a civil war set'st oath to oath
 thy tongue against thy tongue o let thy vow
 first made to heaven first be to heaven perform'd
 that is to be the champion of our church
 what since thou sworest is sworn against thyself
 and may not be performed by thyself
 for that which thou hast sworn to do amiss
 is not amiss when it is truly done
 and being not done where doing tends to ill
 the truth is then most done not doing it
 the better act of purposes mistook
 is to mistake again though indirect
 yet indirection thereby grows direct
 and falsehood falsehood cures as fire cools fire
 within the scorched veins of one newburn'd
 it is religion that doth make vows kept
 but thou hast sworn against religion
 by what thou swear'st against the thing thou swear'st
 and makest an oath the surety for thy truth
 against an oath the truth thou art unsure
 to swear swears only not to be forsworn
 else what a mockery should it be to swear
 but thou dost swear only to be forsworn
 and most forsworn to keep what thou dost swear
 therefore thy later vows against thy first
 is in thyself rebellion to thyself
 and better conquest never canst thou make
 than arm thy constant and thy nobler parts
 against these giddy loose suggestions
 upon which better part our prayers come in
 if thou vouchsafe them but if not then know
 the peril of our curses light on thee
 so heavy as thou shalt not shake them off
 but in despair die under their black weight
austria rebellion flat rebellion
bastard will't not be
 will not a calfsskin stop that mouth of thine
lewis father to arms
blanch upon thy weddingday
 against the blood that thou hast married
 what shall our feast be kept with slaughter'd men
 shall braying trumpets and loud churlish drums
 clamours of hell be measures to our pomp
 o husband hear me ay alack how new
 is husband in my mouth even for that name
 which till this time my tongue did ne'er pronounce
 upon my knee i beg go not to arms
 against mine uncle
constance o upon my knee
 made hard with kneeling i do pray to thee
 thou virtuous dauphin alter not the doom
 forethought by heaven
blanch now shall i see thy love what motive may
 be stronger with thee than the name of wife
constance that which upholdeth him that thee upholds
 his honour o thine honour lewis thine honour
lewis i muse your majesty doth seem so cold
 when such profound respects do pull you on
cardinal pandulph i will denounce a curse upon his head
king philip thou shalt not need england i will fall from thee
constance o fair return of banish'd majesty
queen elinor o foul revolt of french inconstancy
king john france thou shalt rue this hour within this hour
bastard old time the clocksetter that bald sexton time
 is it as he will well then france shall rue
blanch the sun's o'ercast with blood fair day adieu
 which is the side that i must go withal
 i am with both each army hath a hand
 and in their rage i having hold of both
 they swirl asunder and dismember me
 husband i cannot pray that thou mayst win
 uncle i needs must pray that thou mayst lose
 father i may not wish the fortune thine
 grandam i will not wish thy fortunes thrive
 whoever wins on that side shall i lose
 assured loss before the match be play'd
lewis lady with me with me thy fortune lies
blanch there where my fortune lives there my life dies
king john cousin go draw our puissance together
 exit bastard
 france i am burn'd up with inflaming wrath
 a rage whose heat hath this condition
 that nothing can allay nothing but blood
 the blood and dearestvalued blood of france
king philip thy rage sham burn thee up and thou shalt turn
 to ashes ere our blood shall quench that fire
 look to thyself thou art in jeopardy
king john no more than he that threats to arms let's hie
 exeunt

 of hoarding abbots imprisoned angels

bastard bell book and candle shall not drive me back
 when gold and silver becks me to come on
 i leave your highness grandam i will pray

 for your fair safety so i kiss your hand
