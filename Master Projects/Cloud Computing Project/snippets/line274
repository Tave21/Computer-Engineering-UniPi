 before we parted i have made bold iago
 to send in to your wife my suit to her
 is that she will to virtuous desdemona

 out of the way that your converse and business
 may be more free

 enter emilia
emilia good morrow good lieutenant i am sorry
 for your displeasure but all will sure be well
 the general and his wife are talking of it
 and she speaks for you stoutly the moor replies
 that he you hurt is of great fame in cyprus
 and great affinity and that in wholesome wisdom
 he might not but refuse you but he protests he loves you
 and needs no other suitor but his likings
 to take the safest occasion by the front
 to bring you in again
cassio yet i beseech you
 if you think fit or that it may be done
 give me advantage of some brief discourse
 with desdemona alone
emilia pray you come in
 i will bestow you where you shall have time
 to speak your bosom freely
cassio i am much bound to you

scene iii the garden of the castle
 enter desdemona cassio and emilia
desdemona be thou assured good cassio i will do
 all my abilities in thy behalf
emilia good madam do i warrant it grieves my husband
 as if the case were his
desdemona o that's an honest fellow do not doubt cassio
 but i will have my lord and you again
 as friendly as you were
cassio bounteous madam
 whatever shall become of michael cassio
 he's never any thing but your true servant
desdemona i know't i thank you you do love my lord
 you have known him long and be you well assured
 he shall in strangeness stand no further off
 than in a polite distance
cassio ay but lady
 that policy may either last so long
 or feed upon such nice and waterish diet
 or breed itself so out of circumstance
 that i being absent and my place supplied
 my general will forget my love and service
desdemona do not doubt that before emilia here
 i give thee warrant of thy place assure thee
 if i do vow a friendship i'll perform it
 to the last article my lord shall never rest
 i'll watch him tame and talk him out of patience
 his bed shall seem a school his board a shrift
 i'll intermingle every thing he does
 with cassio's suit therefore be merry cassio
 for thy solicitor shall rather die
 than give thy cause away
emilia madam here comes my lord
cassio madam i'll take my leave
desdemona why stay and hear me speak
cassio madam not now i am very ill at ease
 unfit for mine own purposes
desdemona well do your discretion
 exit cassio
 enter othello and iago
iago ha i like not that
othello what dost thou say
iago nothing my lord or ifi know not what
othello was not that cassio parted from my wife
iago cassio my lord no sure i cannot think it
 that he would steal away so guiltylike
 seeing you coming
othello i do believe twas he
desdemona how now my lord
 i have been talking with a suitor here
 a man that languishes in your displeasure
othello who is't you mean
desdemona why your lieutenant cassio good my lord
 if i have any grace or power to move you
 his present reconciliation take
 for if he be not one that truly loves you
 that errs in ignorance and not in cunning
 i have no judgment in an honest face
 i prithee call him back
othello went he hence now
desdemona ay sooth so humbled
 that he hath left part of his grief with me
 to suffer with him good love call him back
othello not now sweet desdemona some other time
desdemona but shall't be shortly
othello the sooner sweet for you
desdemona shall't be tonight at supper
othello no not tonight
desdemona tomorrow dinner then
othello i shall not dine at home
 i meet the captains at the citadel
desdemona why then tomorrow night or tuesday morn
 on tuesday noon or night on wednesday morn
 i prithee name the time but let it not
 exceed three days in faith he's penitent
 and yet his trespass in our common reason
 save that they say the wars must make examples
 out of their bestis not almost a fault
 to incur a private cheque when shall he come
 tell me othello i wonder in my soul
 what you would ask me that i should deny
 or stand so mammering on what michael cassio
 that came awooing with you and so many a time
 when i have spoke of you dispraisingly
 hath ta'en your part to have so much to do
 to bring him in trust me i could do much
othello prithee no more let him come when he will
 i will deny thee nothing
desdemona why this is not a boon
 tis as i should entreat you wear your gloves
 or feed on nourishing dishes or keep you warm
 or sue to you to do a peculiar profit
 to your own person nay when i have a suit
 wherein i mean to touch your love indeed
 it shall be full of poise and difficult weight
 and fearful to be granted
othello i will deny thee nothing
 whereon i do beseech thee grant me this
 to leave me but a little to myself
desdemona shall i deny you no farewell my lord
othello farewell my desdemona i'll come to thee straight
desdemona emilia come be as your fancies teach you
 whate'er you be i am obedient
 exeunt desdemona and emilia
othello excellent wretch perdition catch my soul
 but i do love thee and when i love thee not
 chaos is come again
iago my noble lord
othello what dost thou say iago
iago did michael cassio when you woo'd my lady
 know of your love
othello he did from first to last why dost thou ask
iago but for a satisfaction of my thought
 no further harm
othello why of thy thought iago
iago i did not think he had been acquainted with her
othello o yes and went between us very oft
iago indeed
othello indeed ay indeed discern'st thou aught in that
 is he not honest
iago honest my lord
othello honest ay honest
iago my lord for aught i know
othello what dost thou think
iago think my lord
othello think my lord
 by heaven he echoes me
 as if there were some monster in his thought
 too hideous to be shown thou dost mean something
 i heard thee say even now thou likedst not that
 when cassio left my wife what didst not like
 and when i told thee he was of my counsel
 in my whole course of wooing thou criedst indeed'
 and didst contract and purse thy brow together
 as if thou then hadst shut up in thy brain
 some horrible conceit if thou dost love me
