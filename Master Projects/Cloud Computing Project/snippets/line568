 as troilus is going out enter from the other
 side pandarus
pandarus but hear you hear you
troilus hence brokerlackey ignomy and shame
 pursue thy life and live aye with thy name
 exit
pandarus a goodly medicine for my aching bones o world
 world world thus is the poor agent despised
 o traitors and bawds how earnestly are you set
 awork and how ill requited why should our
 endeavour be so loved and the performance so loathed
 what verse for it what instance for it let me see
 full merrily the humblebee doth sing
 till he hath lost his honey and his sting
 and being once subdued in armed tail
 sweet honey and sweet notes together fail
 good traders in the flesh set this in your
 painted cloths
 as many as be here of pander's hall
 your eyes half out weep out at pandar's fall
 or if you cannot weep yet give some groans
 though not for me yet for your aching bones
 brethren and sisters of the holddoor trade
 some two months hence my will shall here be made
 it should be now but that my fear is this
 some galled goose of winchester would hiss
 till then i'll sweat and seek about for eases
 and at that time bequeathe you my diseases

 twelfth night
act i
scene i duke orsino's palace
 enter duke orsino curio and other lords
 musicians attending
duke orsino if music be the food of love play on
 give me excess of it that surfeiting
 the appetite may sicken and so die
 that strain again it had a dying fall
 o it came o'er my ear like the sweet sound
 that breathes upon a bank of violets
 stealing and giving odour enough no more
 tis not so sweet now as it was before
 o spirit of love how quick and fresh art thou
 that notwithstanding thy capacity
 receiveth as the sea nought enters there
 of what validity and pitch soe'er
 but falls into abatement and low price
 even in a minute so full of shapes is fancy
 that it alone is high fantastical
curio will you go hunt my lord
duke orsino what curio
curio the hart
duke orsino why so i do the noblest that i have
 o when mine eyes did see olivia first
 methought she purged the air of pestilence
 that instant was i turn'd into a hart
 and my desires like fell and cruel hounds
 e'er since pursue me
 enter valentine
 how now what news from her
valentine so please my lord i might not be admitted
 but from her handmaid do return this answer
 the element itself till seven years heat
 shall not behold her face at ample view
 but like a cloistress she will veiled walk
 and water once a day her chamber round
 with eyeoffending brine all this to season
 a brother's dead love which she would keep fresh
 and lasting in her sad remembrance
duke orsino o she that hath a heart of that fine frame
 to pay this debt of love but to a brother
 how will she love when the rich golden shaft
 hath kill'd the flock of all affections else
 that live in her when liver brain and heart
 these sovereign thrones are all supplied and fill'd
 her sweet perfections with one self king
 away before me to sweet beds of flowers
 lovethoughts lie rich when canopied with bowers

 twelfth night
act i
scene ii the seacoast
 enter viola a captain and sailors
viola what country friends is this
captain this is illyria lady
viola and what should i do in illyria
 my brother he is in elysium
 perchance he is not drown'd what think you sailors
captain it is perchance that you yourself were saved
viola o my poor brother and so perchance may he be
captain true madam and to comfort you with chance
 assure yourself after our ship did split
 when you and those poor number saved with you
 hung on our driving boat i saw your brother
 most provident in peril bind himself
 courage and hope both teaching him the practise
 to a strong mast that lived upon the sea
 where like arion on the dolphin's back
 i saw him hold acquaintance with the waves
 so long as i could see
viola for saying so there's gold
 mine own escape unfoldeth to my hope
 whereto thy speech serves for authority
 the like of him know'st thou this country
captain ay madam well for i was bred and born
 not three hours travel from this very place
viola who governs here
captain a noble duke in nature as in name
viola what is the name
captain orsino
viola orsino i have heard my father name him
 he was a bachelor then
captain and so is now or was so very late
 for but a month ago i went from hence
 and then twas fresh in murmuras you know
 what great ones do the less will prattle of
 that he did seek the love of fair olivia
viola what's she
captain a virtuous maid the daughter of a count
 that died some twelvemonth since then leaving her
 in the protection of his son her brother
 who shortly also died for whose dear love
 they say she hath abjured the company
 and sight of men
viola o that i served that lady
 and might not be delivered to the world
 till i had made mine own occasion mellow
 what my estate is
captain that were hard to compass
 because she will admit no kind of suit
 no not the duke's
viola there is a fair behavior in thee captain
 and though that nature with a beauteous wall
 doth oft close in pollution yet of thee
 i will believe thou hast a mind that suits
 with this thy fair and outward character
 i prithee and i'll pay thee bounteously
 conceal me what i am and be my aid
 for such disguise as haply shall become
 the form of my intent i'll serve this duke
 thou shall present me as an eunuch to him
 it may be worth thy pains for i can sing
 and speak to him in many sorts of music
 that will allow me very worth his service
 what else may hap to time i will commit
 only shape thou thy silence to my wit
captain be you his eunuch and your mute i'll be
 when my tongue blabs then let mine eyes not see
viola i thank thee lead me on
