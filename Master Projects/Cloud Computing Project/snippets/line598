 properly ours
antigonus and i wish my liege
 you had only in your silent judgment tried it
 without more overture
leontes how could that be
 either thou art most ignorant by age
 or thou wert born a fool camillo's flight
 added to their familiarity
 which was as gross as ever touch'd conjecture
 that lack'd sight only nought for approbation
 but only seeing all other circumstances
 made up to the deed doth push on this proceeding
 yet for a greater confirmation
 for in an act of this importance twere
 most piteous to be wild i have dispatch'd in post
 to sacred delphos to apollo's temple
 cleomenes and dion whom you know
 of stuff'd sufficiency now from the oracle
 they will bring all whose spiritual counsel had
 shall stop or spur me have i done well
first lord well done my lord
leontes though i am satisfied and need no more
 than what i know yet shall the oracle
 give rest to the minds of others such as he
 whose ignorant credulity will not
 come up to the truth so have we thought it good
 from our free person she should be confined
 lest that the treachery of the two fled hence
 be left her to perform come follow us
 we are to speak in public for this business
 will raise us all
antigonus aside
 to laughter as i take it
 if the good truth were known

 reenter gentleman with the gaoler
 now good sir
 you know me do you not
gaoler for a worthy lady
 and one whom much i honour
paulina pray you then
 conduct me to the queen
gaoler i may not madam
 to the contrary i have express commandment
paulina here's ado
 to lock up honesty and honour from
 the access of gentle visitors
 is't lawful pray you
 to see her women any of them emilia
gaoler so please you madam
 to put apart these your attendants i
 shall bring emilia forth
paulina i pray now call her
 withdraw yourselves
 exeunt gentleman and attendants
gaoler and madam
 i must be present at your conference
paulina well be't so prithee
 exit gaoler
 here's such ado to make no stain a stain
 as passes colouring
 reenter gaoler with emilia
 dear gentlewoman
 how fares our gracious lady
emilia as well as one so great and so forlorn
 may hold together on her frights and griefs
 which never tender lady hath born greater
 she is something before her time deliver'd
paulina a boy
emilia a daughter and a goodly babe
 lusty and like to live the queen receives
 much comfort in't says my poor prisoner
 i am innocent as you'
paulina i dare be sworn
 these dangerous unsafe lunes i the king
 beshrew them
 he must be told on't and he shall the office
 becomes a woman best i'll take't upon me
 if i prove honeymouth'd let my tongue blister
 and never to my redlook'd anger be
 the trumpet any more pray you emilia
 commend my best obedience to the queen
 if she dares trust me with her little babe
 i'll show't the king and undertake to be
 her advocate to the loud'st we do not know
 how he may soften at the sight o the child
 the silence often of pure innocence
 persuades when speaking fails
emilia most worthy madam
 your honour and your goodness is so evident
 that your free undertaking cannot miss
 a thriving issue there is no lady living
 so meet for this great errand please your ladyship
 to visit the next room i'll presently
 acquaint the queen of your most noble offer
 who but today hammer'd of this design
 but durst not tempt a minister of honour
 lest she should be denied
paulina tell her emilia
 i'll use that tongue i have if wit flow from't
 as boldness from my bosom let t not be doubted
 i shall do good
emilia now be you blest for it
 i'll to the queen please you
 come something nearer
gaoler madam if't please the queen to send the babe
 i know not what i shall incur to pass it
 having no warrant
paulina you need not fear it sir
 this child was prisoner to the womb and is
 by law and process of great nature thence
 freed and enfranchised not a party to
 the anger of the king nor guilty of
 if any be the trespass of the queen
gaoler i do believe it
paulina do not you fear upon mine honour
 i will stand betwixt you and danger

 the winter's tale
act ii
scene iii a room in leontes palace
 enter leontes antigonus lords and servants
leontes nor night nor day no rest it is but weakness
 to bear the matter thus mere weakness if
 the cause were not in beingpart o the cause
 she the adulteress for the harlot king
 is quite beyond mine arm out of the blank
 and level of my brain plotproof but she
 i can hook to me say that she were gone
 given to the fire a moiety of my rest
 might come to me again who's there
first servant my lord
leontes how does the boy
first servant he took good rest tonight
 tis hoped his sickness is discharged
leontes to see his nobleness
 conceiving the dishonour of his mother
 he straight declined droop'd took it deeply
 fasten'd and fix'd the shame on't in himself
 threw off his spirit his appetite his sleep
 and downright languish'd leave me solely go
 see how he fares
 exit servant
 fie fie no thought of him
 the thought of my revenges that way
 recoil upon me in himself too mighty
 and in his parties his alliance let him be
 until a time may serve for present vengeance
 take it on her camillo and polixenes
 laugh at me make their pastime at my sorrow
 they should not laugh if i could reach them nor
 shall she within my power
 enter paulina with a child
first lord you must not enter
paulina nay rather good my lords be second to me
 fear you his tyrannous passion more alas
 than the queen's life a gracious innocent soul
 more free than he is jealous
antigonus that's enough
second servant madam he hath not slept tonight commanded
 none should come at him
paulina not so hot good sir
 i come to bring him sleep tis such as you
 that creep like shadows by him and do sigh
 at each his needless heavings such as you
 nourish the cause of his awaking i
 do come with words as medicinal as true
 honest as either to purge him of that humour
 that presses him from sleep
leontes what noise there ho
paulina no noise my lord but needful conference
 about some gossips for your highness
leontes how
 away with that audacious lady antigonus
 i charged thee that she should not come about me
 i knew she would
antigonus i told her so my lord
 on your displeasure's peril and on mine
 she should not visit you
leontes what canst not rule her
paulina from all dishonesty he can in this
 unless he take the course that you have done
 commit me for committing honour trust it
 he shall not rule me
antigonus la you now you hear
 when she will take the rein i let her run
 but she'll not stumble
paulina good my liege i come
 and i beseech you hear me who profess
 myself your loyal servant your physician
