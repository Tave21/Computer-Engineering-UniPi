 are to be smiled at their offences being so
 capital tell me for you seem to be honest plain
 men what you have to the king being something
 gently considered i'll bring you where he is
 aboard tender your persons to his presence
 whisper him in your behalfs and if it be in man
 besides the king to effect your suits here is man

 give him gold and though authority be a stubborn
 bear yet he is oft led by the nose with gold show
 the inside of your purse to the outside of his hand
 and no more ado remember stoned and flayed alive'

 to do the prince my master good which who knows how
 that may turn back to my advancement i will bring
 these two moles these blind ones aboard him if he

 complaint they have to the king concerns him

 officious for i am proof against that title and
 what shame else belongs to't to him will i present
 them there may be matter in it
 exit
 the winter's tale
act v
scene i a room in leontes palace
 enter leontes cleomenes dion paulina and servants
cleomenes sir you have done enough and have perform'd
 a saintlike sorrow no fault could you make
 which you have not redeem'd indeed paid down
 more penitence than done trespass at the last
 do as the heavens have done forget your evil
 with them forgive yourself
leontes whilst i remember
 her and her virtues i cannot forget
 my blemishes in them and so still think of
 the wrong i did myself which was so much
 that heirless it hath made my kingdom and
 destroy'd the sweet'st companion that e'er man
 bred his hopes out of
paulina true too true my lord
 if one by one you wedded all the world
 or from the all that are took something good
 to make a perfect woman she you kill'd
 would be unparallel'd
leontes i think so kill'd
 she i kill'd i did so but thou strikest me
 sorely to say i did it is as bitter
 upon thy tongue as in my thought now good now
 say so but seldom
cleomenes not at all good lady
 you might have spoken a thousand things that would
 have done the time more benefit and graced
 your kindness better
paulina you are one of those
 would have him wed again
dion if you would not so
 you pity not the state nor the remembrance
 of his most sovereign name consider little
 what dangers by his highness fail of issue
 may drop upon his kingdom and devour
 incertain lookers on what were more holy
 than to rejoice the former queen is well
 what holier than for royalty's repair
 for present comfort and for future good
 to bless the bed of majesty again
 with a sweet fellow to't
paulina there is none worthy
 respecting her that's gone besides the gods
 will have fulfill'd their secret purposes
 for has not the divine apollo said
 is't not the tenor of his oracle
 that king leontes shall not have an heir
 till his lost child be found which that it shall
 is all as monstrous to our human reason
 as my antigonus to break his grave
 and come again to me who on my life
 did perish with the infant tis your counsel
 my lord should to the heavens be contrary
 oppose against their wills
 to leontes
 care not for issue
 the crown will find an heir great alexander
 left his to the worthiest so his successor
 was like to be the best
leontes good paulina
 who hast the memory of hermione
 i know in honour o that ever i
 had squared me to thy counsel then even now
 i might have look'd upon my queen's full eyes
 have taken treasure from her lips
paulina and left them
 more rich for what they yielded
leontes thou speak'st truth
 no more such wives therefore no wife one worse
 and better used would make her sainted spirit
 again possess her corpse and on this stage
 where we're offenders now appear soulvex'd
 and begin why to me'
paulina had she such power
 she had just cause
leontes she had and would incense me
 to murder her i married
paulina i should so
 were i the ghost that walk'd i'ld bid you mark
 her eye and tell me for what dull part in't
 you chose her then i'ld shriek that even your ears
 should rift to hear me and the words that follow'd
 should be remember mine'
leontes stars stars
 and all eyes else dead coals fear thou no wife
 i'll have no wife paulina
paulina will you swear
 never to marry but by my free leave
leontes never paulina so be blest my spirit
paulina then good my lords bear witness to his oath
cleomenes you tempt him overmuch
paulina unless another
 as like hermione as is her picture
 affront his eye
cleomenes good madam
paulina i have done
 yet if my lord will marryif you will sir
 no remedy but you willgive me the office
 to choose you a queen she shall not be so young
 as was your former but she shall be such
 as walk'd your first queen's ghost
 it should take joy
 to see her in your arms
leontes my true paulina
 we shall not marry till thou bid'st us
paulina that
 shall be when your first queen's again in breath
 never till then
 enter a gentleman
gentleman one that gives out himself prince florizel
 son of polixenes with his princess she
 the fairest i have yet beheld desires access
 to your high presence
leontes what with him he comes not
 like to his father's greatness his approach
 so out of circumstance and sudden tells us
 tis not a visitation framed but forced
 by need and accident what train
gentleman but few
 and those but mean
leontes his princess say you with him
gentleman ay the most peerless piece of earth i think
 that e'er the sun shone bright on
paulina o hermione
 as every present time doth boast itself
 above a better gone so must thy grave
 give way to what's seen now sir you yourself
 have said and writ so but your writing now
 is colder than that theme she had not been
 nor was not to be equall'd'thus your verse
 flow'd with her beauty once tis shrewdly ebb'd
 to say you have seen a better
gentleman pardon madam
 the one i have almost forgotyour pardon
 the other when she has obtain'd your eye
 will have your tongue too this is a creature
 would she begin a sect might quench the zeal
 of all professors else make proselytes
 of who she but bid follow
paulina how not women
gentleman women will love her that she is a woman
 more worth than any man men that she is
 the rarest of all women
leontes go cleomenes
 yourself assisted with your honour'd friends
 bring them to our embracement still tis strange
 exeunt cleomenes and others
 he thus should steal upon us
paulina had our prince
