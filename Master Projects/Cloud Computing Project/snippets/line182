 flourish cornets exeunt in state as before
 brutus and sicinius come forward
brutus all tongues speak of him and the bleared sights
 are spectacled to see him your prattling nurse
 into a rapture lets her baby cry
 while she chats him the kitchen malkin pins
 her richest lockram bout her reechy neck
 clambering the walls to eye him stalls bulks windows
 are smother'd up leads fill'd and ridges horsed
 with variable complexions all agreeing
 in earnestness to see him seldshown flamens
 do press among the popular throngs and puff
 to win a vulgar station or veil'd dames
 commit the war of white and damask in
 their nicelygawded cheeks to the wanton spoil
 of phoebus burning kisses such a pother
 as if that whatsoever god who leads him
 were slily crept into his human powers
 and gave him graceful posture
sicinius on the sudden
 i warrant him consul
brutus then our office may
 during his power go sleep
sicinius he cannot temperately transport his honours
 from where he should begin and end but will
 lose those he hath won
brutus in that there's comfort
sicinius doubt not
 the commoners for whom we stand but they
 upon their ancient malice will forget
 with the least cause these his new honours which
 that he will give them make i as little question
 as he is proud to do't
brutus i heard him swear
 were he to stand for consul never would he
 appear i the marketplace nor on him put
 the napless vesture of humility
 nor showing as the manner is his wounds
 to the people beg their stinking breaths
sicinius tis right
brutus it was his word o he would miss it rather
 than carry it but by the suit of the gentry to him
 and the desire of the nobles
sicinius i wish no better
 than have him hold that purpose and to put it
 in execution
brutus tis most like he will
sicinius it shall be to him then as our good wills
 a sure destruction
brutus so it must fall out
 to him or our authorities for an end
 we must suggest the people in what hatred
 he still hath held them that to's power he would
 have made them mules silenced their pleaders and
 dispropertied their freedoms holding them
 in human action and capacity
 of no more soul nor fitness for the world
 than camels in the war who have their provand
 only for bearing burdens and sore blows
 for sinking under them
sicinius this as you say suggested
 at some time when his soaring insolence
 shall touch the peoplewhich time shall not want
 if he be put upon t and that's as easy
 as to set dogs on sheepwill be his fire
 to kindle their dry stubble and their blaze
 shall darken him for ever
 enter a messenger
brutus what's the matter
messenger you are sent for to the capitol tis thought
 that marcius shall be consul
 i have seen the dumb men throng to see him and
 the blind to bear him speak matrons flung gloves
 ladies and maids their scarfs and handkerchers
 upon him as he pass'd the nobles bended
 as to jove's statue and the commons made
 a shower and thunder with their caps and shouts
 i never saw the like
brutus let's to the capitol
 and carry with us ears and eyes for the time
 but hearts for the event
sicinius have with you
 exeunt
 coriolanus
act ii
scene ii the same the capitol
 enter two officers to lay cushions
first officer come come they are almost here how many stand
 for consulships
second officer three they say but tis thought of every one
 coriolanus will carry it
first officer that's a brave fellow but he's vengeance proud and
 loves not the common people
second officer faith there had been many great men that have
 flattered the people who ne'er loved them and there
 be many that they have loved they know not
 wherefore so that if they love they know not why
 they hate upon no better a ground therefore for
 coriolanus neither to care whether they love or hate
 him manifests the true knowledge he has in their
 disposition and out of his noble carelessness lets
 them plainly see't
first officer if he did not care whether he had their love or no
 he waved indifferently twixt doing them neither
 good nor harm but he seeks their hate with greater
 devotion than can render it him and leaves
 nothing undone that may fully discover him their
 opposite now to seem to affect the malice and
 displeasure of the people is as bad as that which he
 dislikes to flatter them for their love
second officer he hath deserved worthily of his country and his
 ascent is not by such easy degrees as those who
 having been supple and courteous to the people
 bonneted without any further deed to have them at
 an into their estimation and report but he hath so
 planted his honours in their eyes and his actions
 in their hearts that for their tongues to be
 silent and not confess so much were a kind of
 ingrateful injury to report otherwise were a
 malice that giving itself the lie would pluck
 reproof and rebuke from every ear that heard it
first officer no more of him he is a worthy man make way they
 are coming
 a sennet enter with actors before them cominius
 the consul menenius coriolanus senators
 sicinius and brutus the senators take their
 places the tribunes take their places by
 themselves coriolanus stands
menenius having determined of the volsces and
 to send for titus lartius it remains
 as the main point of this our aftermeeting
 to gratify his noble service that
 hath thus stood for his country therefore
 please you
 most reverend and grave elders to desire
 the present consul and last general
 in our wellfound successes to report
 a little of that worthy work perform'd
 by caius marcius coriolanus whom
 we met here both to thank and to remember
 with honours like himself
first senator speak good cominius
 leave nothing out for length and make us think
 rather our state's defective for requital
 than we to stretch it out
 to the tribunes
 masters o the people
 we do request your kindest ears and after
 your loving motion toward the common body
 to yield what passes here
sicinius we are convented
 upon a pleasing treaty and have hearts
 inclinable to honour and advance
 the theme of our assembly
brutus which the rather
 we shall be blest to do if he remember
 a kinder value of the people than
 he hath hereto prized them at
menenius that's off that's off
 i would you rather had been silent please you
 to hear cominius speak
brutus most willingly
 but yet my caution was more pertinent
 than the rebuke you give it
menenius he loves your people
 but tie him not to be their bedfellow
 worthy cominius speak
 coriolanus offers to go away
 nay keep your place
first senator sit coriolanus never shame to hear
 what you have nobly done
coriolanus your horror's pardon
 i had rather have my wounds to heal again
 than hear say how i got them
brutus sir i hope
 my words disbench'd you not
coriolanus no sir yet oft
 when blows have made me stay i fled from words
 you soothed not therefore hurt not but
 your people
 i love them as they weigh
menenius pray now sit down
coriolanus i had rather have one scratch my head i the sun
 when the alarum were struck than idly sit
 to hear my nothings monster'd
 exit
menenius masters of the people
 your multiplying spawn how can he flatter
 that's thousand to one good onewhen you now see
 he had rather venture all his limbs for honour
 than one on's ears to hear it proceed cominius
cominius i shall lack voice the deeds of coriolanus
 should not be utter'd feebly it is held
 that valour is the chiefest virtue and
 most dignifies the haver if it be
 the man i speak of cannot in the world
 be singly counterpoised at sixteen years
 when tarquin made a head for rome he fought
 beyond the mark of others our then dictator
 whom with all praise i point at saw him fight
