 commons of melford how now sir knave
second petitioner alas sir i am but a poor petitioner of our whole township
peter giving his petition against my master thomas
 horner for saying that the duke of york was rightful
 heir to the crown
queen margaret what sayst thou did the duke of york say he was
 rightful heir to the crown
peter that my master was no forsooth my master said
 that he was and that the king was an usurper
suffolk who is there
 enter servant
 take this fellow in and send for
 his master with a pursuivant presently we'll hear
 more of your matter before the king
 exit servant with peter
queen margaret and as for you that love to be protected
 under the wings of our protector's grace
 begin your suits anew and sue to him
 tears the supplication
 away base cullions suffolk let them go
all come let's be gone
 exeunt
queen margaret my lord of suffolk say is this the guise
 is this the fashion in the court of england
 is this the government of britain's isle
 and this the royalty of albion's king
 what shall king henry be a pupil still
 under the surly gloucester's governance
 am i a queen in title and in style
 and must be made a subject to a duke
 i tell thee pole when in the city tours
 thou ran'st a tilt in honour of my love
 and stolest away the ladies hearts of france
 i thought king henry had resembled thee
 in courage courtship and proportion
 but all his mind is bent to holiness
 to number avemaries on his beads
 his champions are the prophets and apostles
 his weapons holy saws of sacred writ
 his study is his tiltyard and his loves
 are brazen images of canonized saints
 i would the college of the cardinals
 would choose him pope and carry him to rome
 and set the triple crown upon his head
 that were a state fit for his holiness
suffolk madam be patient as i was cause
 your highness came to england so will i
 in england work your grace's full content
queen margaret beside the haughty protector have we beaufort
 the imperious churchman somerset buckingham
 and grumbling york and not the least of these
 but can do more in england than the king
suffolk and he of these that can do most of all
 cannot do more in england than the nevils
 salisbury and warwick are no simple peers
queen margaret not all these lords do vex me half so much
 as that proud dame the lord protector's wife
 she sweeps it through the court with troops of ladies
 more like an empress than duke humphrey's wife
 strangers in court do take her for the queen
 she bears a duke's revenues on her back
 and in her heart she scorns our poverty
 shall i not live to be avenged on her
 contemptuous baseborn callet as she is
 she vaunted mongst her minions t'other day
 the very train of her worst wearing gown
 was better worth than all my father's lands
 till suffolk gave two dukedoms for his daughter
suffolk madam myself have limed a bush for her
 and placed a quire of such enticing birds
 that she will light to listen to the lays
 and never mount to trouble you again
 so let her rest and madam list to me
 for i am bold to counsel you in this
 although we fancy not the cardinal
 yet must we join with him and with the lords
 till we have brought duke humphrey in disgrace
 as for the duke of york this late complaint
 will make but little for his benefit
 so one by one we'll weed them all at last
 and you yourself shall steer the happy helm
 sound a sennet enter king henry vi gloucester
 cardinal buckingham york somerset salisbury
 warwick and the duchess
king henry vi for my part noble lords i care not which
 or somerset or york all's one to me
york if york have ill demean'd himself in france
 then let him be denay'd the regentship
somerset if somerset be unworthy of the place
 let york be regent i will yield to him
warwick whether your grace be worthy yea or no
 dispute not that york is the worthier
cardinal ambitious warwick let thy betters speak
warwick the cardinal's not my better in the field
buckingham all in this presence are thy betters warwick
warwick warwick may live to be the best of all
salisbury peace son and show some reason buckingham
 why somerset should be preferred in this
queen margaret because the king forsooth will have it so
gloucester madam the king is old enough himself
 to give his censure these are no women's matters
queen margaret if he be old enough what needs your grace
 to be protector of his excellence
gloucester madam i am protector of the realm
 and at his pleasure will resign my place
suffolk resign it then and leave thine insolence
 since thou wert kingas who is king but thou
 the commonwealth hath daily run to wreck
 the dauphin hath prevail'd beyond the seas
 and all the peers and nobles of the realm
 have been as bondmen to thy sovereignty
cardinal the commons hast thou rack'd the clergy's bags
 are lank and lean with thy extortions
somerset thy sumptuous buildings and thy wife's attire
 have cost a mass of public treasury
buckingham thy cruelty in execution
 upon offenders hath exceeded law
 and left thee to the mercy of the law
queen margaret they sale of offices and towns in france
 if they were known as the suspect is great
 would make thee quickly hop without thy head
 exit gloucester queen margaret drops her fan
 give me my fan what minion can ye not
 she gives the duchess a box on the ear
 i cry you mercy madam was it you
duchess was't i yea i it was proud frenchwoman
 could i come near your beauty with my nails
 i'd set my ten commandments in your face
king henry vi sweet aunt be quiet twas against her will
duchess against her will good king look to't in time
 she'll hamper thee and dandle thee like a baby
 though in this place most master wear no breeches
 she shall not strike dame eleanor unrevenged
 exit
buckingham lord cardinal i will follow eleanor
 and listen after humphrey how he proceeds
 she's tickled now her fume needs no spurs
 she'll gallop far enough to her destruction
 exit
 reenter gloucester
gloucester now lords my choler being overblown
 with walking once about the quadrangle
 i come to talk of commonwealth affairs
 as for your spiteful false objections
 prove them and i lie open to the law
 but god in mercy so deal with my soul
 as i in duty love my king and country
 but to the matter that we have in hand
 i say my sovereign york is meetest man
 to be your regent in the realm of france
suffolk before we make election give me leave
 to show some reason of no little force
 that york is most unmeet of any man
york i'll tell thee suffolk why i am unmeet
 first for i cannot flatter thee in pride
 next if i be appointed for the place
 my lord of somerset will keep me here
 without discharge money or furniture
 till france be won into the dauphin's hands
 last time i danced attendance on his will
 till paris was besieged famish'd and lost
warwick that can i witness and a fouler fact
 did never traitor in the land commit
suffolk peace headstrong warwick
warwick image of pride why should i hold my peace
 enter horner the armourer and his man
 peter guarded
suffolk because here is a man accused of treason
 pray god the duke of york excuse himself
york doth any one accuse york for a traitor
king henry vi what mean'st thou suffolk tell me what are these
suffolk please it your majesty this is the man
 that doth accuse his master of high treason
 his words were these that richard duke of york
 was rightful heir unto the english crown
 and that your majesty was a usurper
king henry vi say man were these thy words
horner an't shall please your majesty i never said nor
 thought any such matter god is my witness i am
 falsely accused by the villain
peter by these ten bones my lords he did speak them to
 me in the garret one night as we were scouring my
 lord of york's armour
york base dunghill villain and mechanical
 i'll have thy head for this thy traitor's speech
 i do beseech your royal majesty
 let him have all the rigor of the law
