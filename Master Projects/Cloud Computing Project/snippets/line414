 enter belarius guiderius and arviragus
belarius you polydote have proved best woodman and
 are master of the feast cadwal and i
 will play the cook and servant tis our match
 the sweat of industry would dry and die
 but for the end it works to come our stomachs
 will make what's homely savoury weariness
 can snore upon the flint when resty sloth
 finds the down pillow hard now peace be here
 poor house that keep'st thyself
guiderius i am thoroughly weary
arviragus i am weak with toil yet strong in appetite
guiderius there is cold meat i the cave we'll browse on that
 whilst what we have kill'd be cook'd
belarius looking into the cave
 stay come not in
 but that it eats our victuals i should think
 here were a fairy
guiderius what's the matter sir
belarius by jupiter an angel or if not
 an earthly paragon behold divineness
 no elder than a boy
 reenter imogen
imogen good masters harm me not
 before i enter'd here i call'd and thought
 to have begg'd or bought what i have took
 good troth
 i have stol'n nought nor would not though i had found
 gold strew'd i the floor here's money for my meat
 i would have left it on the board so soon
 as i had made my meal and parted
 with prayers for the provider
guiderius money youth
arviragus all gold and silver rather turn to dirt
 as tis no better reckon'd but of those
 who worship dirty gods
imogen i see you're angry
 know if you kill me for my fault i should
 have died had i not made it
belarius whither bound
imogen to milfordhaven

imogen fidele sir i have a kinsman who
 is bound for italy he embark'd at milford
 to whom being going almost spent with hunger
 i am fall'n in this offence
belarius prithee fair youth

 by this rude place we live in well encounter'd
 tis almost night you shall have better cheer
 ere you depart and thanks to stay and eat it
 boys bid him welcome
guiderius were you a woman youth
 i should woo hard but be your groom in honesty
 i bid for you as i'd buy
arviragus i'll make't my comfort

 and such a welcome as i'd give to him
 after long absence such is yours most welcome

imogen mongst friends
 if brothers
 aside
 would it had been so that they
 had been my father's sons then had my prize
 been less and so more equal ballasting
 to thee posthumus
belarius he wrings at some distress
guiderius would i could free't
arviragus or i whate'er it be
 what pain it cost what danger god's
belarius hark boys
 whispering
imogen great men
 that had a court no bigger than this cave
 that did attend themselves and had the virtue
 which their own conscience seal'd themlaying by
 that nothinggift of differing multitudes
 could not outpeer these twain pardon me gods
 i'd change my sex to be companion with them
 since leonatus's false
belarius it shall be so
 boys we'll go dress our hunt fair youth come in
 discourse is heavy fasting when we have supp'd
 we'll mannerly demand thee of thy story
 so far as thou wilt speak it
guiderius pray draw near
arviragus the night to the owl and morn to the lark
 less welcome
imogen thanks sir

 enter cloten
cloten i am near to the place where they should meet if
 pisanio have mapped it truly how fit his garments
 serve me why should his mistress who was made by
 him that made the tailor not be fit too the
 rathersaving reverence of the wordfor tis said
 a woman's fitness comes by fits therein i must
 play the workman i dare speak it to myselffor it
 is not vainglory for a man and his glass to confer
 in his own chamberi mean the lines of my body are
 as well drawn as his no less young more strong
 not beneath him in fortunes beyond him in the
 advantage of the time above him in birth alike
 conversant in general services and more remarkable
 in single oppositions yet this imperceiverant
 thing loves him in my despite what mortality is
 posthumus thy head which now is growing upon thy
 shoulders shall within this hour be off thy
 mistress enforced thy garments cut to pieces before
 thy face and all this done spurn her home to her
 father who may haply be a little angry for my so
 rough usage but my mother having power of his
 testiness shall turn all into my commendations my
 horse is tied up safe out sword and to a sore
 purpose fortune put them into my hand this is
 the very description of their meetingplace and
 the fellow dares not deceive me
