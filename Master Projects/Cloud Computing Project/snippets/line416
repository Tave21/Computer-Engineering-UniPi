 in embassy to his mother his body's hostage
 for his return
 solemn music
belarius my ingenious instrument
 hark polydore it sounds but what occasion
 hath cadwal now to give it motion hark
guiderius is he at home
belarius he went hence even now
guiderius what does he mean since death of my dear'st mother
 it did not speak before all solemn things
 should answer solemn accidents the matter
 triumphs for nothing and lamenting toys
 is jollity for apes and grief for boys
 is cadwal mad
belarius look here he comes
 and brings the dire occasion in his arms
 of what we blame him for
 reenter arviragus with imogen as dead
 bearing her in his arms
arviragus the bird is dead
 that we have made so much on i had rather
 have skipp'd from sixteen years of age to sixty
 to have turn'd my leapingtime into a crutch
 than have seen this
guiderius o sweetest fairest lily
 my brother wears thee not the one half so well
 as when thou grew'st thyself
belarius o melancholy
 who ever yet could sound thy bottom find
 the ooze to show what coast thy sluggish crare
 might easiliest harbour in thou blessed thing
 jove knows what man thou mightst have made but i
 thou diedst a most rare boy of melancholy
 how found you him
arviragus stark as you see
 thus smiling as some fly hid tickled slumber
 not as death's dart being laugh'd at his
 right cheek
 reposing on a cushion
guiderius where
arviragus o the floor
 his arms thus leagued i thought he slept and put
 my clouted brogues from off my feet whose rudeness
 answer'd my steps too loud
guiderius why he but sleeps
 if he be gone he'll make his grave a bed
 with female fairies will his tomb be haunted
 and worms will not come to thee
arviragus with fairest flowers
 whilst summer lasts and i live here fidele
 i'll sweeten thy sad grave thou shalt not lack
 the flower that's like thy face pale primrose nor
 the azured harebell like thy veins no nor
 the leaf of eglantine whom not to slander
 outsweeten'd not thy breath the ruddock would
 with charitable billo bill soreshaming
 those richleft heirs that let their fathers lie
 without a monumentbring thee all this
 yea and furr'd moss besides when flowers are none
 to winterground thy corse
guiderius prithee have done
 and do not play in wenchlike words with that
 which is so serious let us bury him
 and not protract with admiration what
 is now due debt to the grave
arviragus say where shall's lay him
guiderius by good euriphile our mother
arviragus be't so
 and let us polydore though now our voices
 have got the mannish crack sing him to the ground
 as once our mother use like note and words
 save that euriphile must be fidele
guiderius cadwal
 i cannot sing i'll weep and word it with thee
 for notes of sorrow out of tune are worse
 than priests and fanes that lie
arviragus we'll speak it then
belarius great griefs i see medicine the less for cloten
 is quite forgot he was a queen's son boys
 and though he came our enemy remember
 he was paid for that though mean and
 mighty rotting
 together have one dust yet reverence
 that angel of the world doth make distinction
 of place tween high and low our foe was princely
 and though you took his life as being our foe
 yet bury him as a prince
guiderius pray you fetch him hither
 thersites body is as good as ajax'
 when neither are alive
arviragus if you'll go fetch him
 we'll say our song the whilst brother begin
 exit belarius
guiderius nay cadwal we must lay his head to the east
 my father hath a reason for't
arviragus tis true
guiderius come on then and remove him
arviragus so begin
 song
guiderius fear no more the heat o the sun
 nor the furious winter's rages
 thou thy worldly task hast done
 home art gone and ta'en thy wages
 golden lads and girls all must
 as chimneysweepers come to dust
arviragus fear no more the frown o the great
 thou art past the tyrant's stroke
 care no more to clothe and eat
 to thee the reed is as the oak
 the sceptre learning physic must
 all follow this and come to dust
guiderius fear no more the lightning flash
arviragus nor the alldreaded thunderstone
guiderius fear not slander censure rash
arviragus thou hast finish'd joy and moan
guiderius 
 all lovers young all lovers must
arviragus consign to thee and come to dust
guiderius no exorciser harm thee
arviragus nor no witchcraft charm thee
guiderius ghost unlaid forbear thee
arviragus nothing ill come near thee
guiderius 
 quiet consummation have
arviragus and renowned be thy grave
 reenter belarius with the body of cloten
guiderius we have done our obsequies come lay him down
belarius here's a few flowers but bout midnight more
 the herbs that have on them cold dew o the night
 are strewings fitt'st for graves upon their faces
 you were as flowers now wither'd even so
 these herblets shall which we upon you strew
 come on away apart upon our knees
 the ground that gave them first has them again
 their pleasures here are past so is their pain
 exeunt belarius guiderius and arviragus
imogen awaking yes sir to milfordhaven which is
 the way
 i thank youby yond bushpray how far thither
 ods pittikins can it be six mile yet
 i have gone all night faith i'll lie down and sleep
 but soft no bedfellowo gods and goddesses
 seeing the body of cloten
 these flowers are like the pleasures of the world
 this bloody man the care on't i hope i dream
 for so i thought i was a cavekeeper
 and cook to honest creatures but tis not so
 twas but a bolt of nothing shot at nothing
 which the brain makes of fumes our very eyes
 are sometimes like our judgments blind good faith
 i tremble stiff with fear but if there be
 yet left in heaven as small a drop of pity
 as a wren's eye fear'd gods a part of it
 the dream's here still even when i wake it is
 without me as within me not imagined felt
 a headless man the garments of posthumus
 i know the shape of's leg this is his hand
 his foot mercurial his martial thigh
 the brawns of hercules but his jovial face

 and mine to boot be darted on thee thou
 conspired with that irregulous devil cloten
 hast here cut off my lord to write and read
 be henceforth treacherous damn'd pisanio

 from this most bravest vessel of the world
 struck the maintop o posthumus alas
 where is thy head where's that ay me
 where's that
 pisanio might have kill'd thee at the heart
 and left this head on how should this be pisanio
 tis he and cloten malice and lucre in them
 have laid this woe here o tis pregnant pregnant
 the drug he gave me which he said was precious
 and cordial to me have i not found it
 murderous to the senses that confirms it home
