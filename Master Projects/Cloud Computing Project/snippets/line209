 dies not alone but like a gulf doth draw
 what's near it with it it is a massy wheel
 fix'd on the summit of the highest mount
 to whose huge spokes ten thousand lesser things
 are mortised and adjoin'd which when it falls
 each small annexment petty consequence
 attends the boisterous ruin never alone
 did the king sigh but with a general groan
king claudius arm you i pray you to this speedy voyage
 for we will fetters put upon this fear
 which now goes too freefooted
rosencrantz 
 we will haste us
guildenstern 
 exeunt rosencrantz and guildenstern
 enter polonius
lord polonius my lord he's going to his mother's closet
 behind the arras i'll convey myself
 to hear the process and warrant she'll tax him home
 and as you said and wisely was it said
 tis meet that some more audience than a mother
 since nature makes them partial should o'erhear
 the speech of vantage fare you well my liege
 i'll call upon you ere you go to bed
 and tell you what i know
king claudius thanks dear my lord
 exit polonius
 o my offence is rank it smells to heaven
 it hath the primal eldest curse upon't
 a brother's murder pray can i not
 though inclination be as sharp as will
 my stronger guilt defeats my strong intent
 and like a man to double business bound
 i stand in pause where i shall first begin
 and both neglect what if this cursed hand
 were thicker than itself with brother's blood
 is there not rain enough in the sweet heavens
 to wash it white as snow whereto serves mercy
 but to confront the visage of offence
 and what's in prayer but this twofold force
 to be forestalled ere we come to fall
 or pardon'd being down then i'll look up
 my fault is past but o what form of prayer
 can serve my turn forgive me my foul murder'
 that cannot be since i am still possess'd
 of those effects for which i did the murder
 my crown mine own ambition and my queen
 may one be pardon'd and retain the offence
 in the corrupted currents of this world
 offence's gilded hand may shove by justice
 and oft tis seen the wicked prize itself
 buys out the law but tis not so above
 there is no shuffling there the action lies
 in his true nature and we ourselves compell'd
 even to the teeth and forehead of our faults
 to give in evidence what then what rests
 try what repentance can what can it not
 yet what can it when one can not repent
 o wretched state o bosom black as death
 o limed soul that struggling to be free
 art more engaged help angels make assay
 bow stubborn knees and heart with strings of steel
 be soft as sinews of the newborn babe
 all may be well
 retires and kneels
 enter hamlet
hamlet now might i do it pat now he is praying
 and now i'll do't and so he goes to heaven
 and so am i revenged that would be scann'd
 a villain kills my father and for that
 i his sole son do this same villain send
 to heaven
 o this is hire and salary not revenge
 he took my father grossly full of bread
 with all his crimes broad blown as flush as may
 and how his audit stands who knows save heaven
 but in our circumstance and course of thought
 tis heavy with him and am i then revenged
 to take him in the purging of his soul
 when he is fit and season'd for his passage
 no
 up sword and know thou a more horrid hent
 when he is drunk asleep or in his rage
 or in the incestuous pleasure of his bed
 at gaming swearing or about some act
 that has no relish of salvation in't
 then trip him that his heels may kick at heaven
 and that his soul may be as damn'd and black
 as hell whereto it goes my mother stays
 this physic but prolongs thy sickly days
 exit
king claudius rising my words fly up my thoughts remain below
 words without thoughts never to heaven go
 exit
 hamlet
act iii
scene iv the queen's closet
 enter queen margaret and polonius
lord polonius he will come straight look you lay home to him
 tell him his pranks have been too broad to bear with
 and that your grace hath screen'd and stood between
 much heat and him i'll sconce me even here
 pray you be round with him
hamlet within mother mother mother
queen gertrude i'll warrant you
 fear me not withdraw i hear him coming
 polonius hides behind the arras
 enter hamlet
hamlet now mother what's the matter
queen gertrude hamlet thou hast thy father much offended
hamlet mother you have my father much offended
queen gertrude come come you answer with an idle tongue
hamlet go go you question with a wicked tongue
queen gertrude why how now hamlet
hamlet what's the matter now
queen gertrude have you forgot me
hamlet no by the rood not so
 you are the queen your husband's brother's wife
 andwould it were not soyou are my mother
queen gertrude nay then i'll set those to you that can speak
hamlet come come and sit you down you shall not budge
 you go not till i set you up a glass
 where you may see the inmost part of you
queen gertrude what wilt thou do thou wilt not murder me
 help help ho
lord polonius behind what ho help help help
hamlet drawing how now a rat dead for a ducat dead
 makes a pass through the arras
lord polonius behind o i am slain
 falls and dies
queen gertrude o me what hast thou done
hamlet nay i know not
 is it the king
queen gertrude o what a rash and bloody deed is this
hamlet a bloody deed almost as bad good mother
 as kill a king and marry with his brother
queen gertrude as kill a king
hamlet ay lady twas my word
 lifts up the array and discovers polonius
 thou wretched rash intruding fool farewell
 i took thee for thy better take thy fortune
 thou find'st to be too busy is some danger
 leave wringing of your hands peace sit you down
 and let me wring your heart for so i shall
 if it be made of penetrable stuff
 if damned custom have not brass'd it so
 that it is proof and bulwark against sense
queen gertrude what have i done that thou darest wag thy tongue
 in noise so rude against me
hamlet such an act
 that blurs the grace and blush of modesty
 calls virtue hypocrite takes off the rose
 from the fair forehead of an innocent love
 and sets a blister there makes marriagevows
 as false as dicers oaths o such a deed
 as from the body of contraction plucks
 the very soul and sweet religion makes
 a rhapsody of words heaven's face doth glow
 yea this solidity and compound mass
 with tristful visage as against the doom
 is thoughtsick at the act
queen gertrude ay me what act
 that roars so loud and thunders in the index
hamlet look here upon this picture and on this
 the counterfeit presentment of two brothers
 see what a grace was seated on this brow
 hyperion's curls the front of jove himself
 an eye like mars to threaten and command
 a station like the herald mercury
 newlighted on a heavenkissing hill
 a combination and a form indeed
 where every god did seem to set his seal
 to give the world assurance of a man
 this was your husband look you now what follows
 here is your husband like a mildew'd ear
 blasting his wholesome brother have you eyes
 could you on this fair mountain leave to feed
 and batten on this moor ha have you eyes
 you cannot call it love for at your age
 the heyday in the blood is tame it's humble
 and waits upon the judgment and what judgment
 would step from this to this sense sure you have
 else could you not have motion but sure that sense
 is apoplex'd for madness would not err
 nor sense to ecstasy was ne'er so thrall'd
 but it reserved some quantity of choice
 to serve in such a difference what devil was't
 that thus hath cozen'd you at hoodmanblind
 eyes without feeling feeling without sight
 ears without hands or eyes smelling sans all
 or but a sickly part of one true sense
 could not so mope
 o shame where is thy blush rebellious hell
 if thou canst mutine in a matron's bones
 to flaming youth let virtue be as wax
 and melt in her own fire proclaim no shame
 when the compulsive ardour gives the charge
 since frost itself as actively doth burn
 and reason panders will
queen gertrude o hamlet speak no more
