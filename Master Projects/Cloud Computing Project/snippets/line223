brutus peace count the clock
cassius the clock hath stricken three
trebonius tis time to part
cassius but it is doubtful yet
 whether caesar will come forth today or no
 for he is superstitious grown of late
 quite from the main opinion he held once
 of fantasy of dreams and ceremonies
 it may be these apparent prodigies
 the unaccustom'd terror of this night
 and the persuasion of his augurers
 may hold him from the capitol today
decius brutus never fear that if he be so resolved
 i can o'ersway him for he loves to hear
 that unicorns may be betray'd with trees
 and bears with glasses elephants with holes
 lions with toils and men with flatterers
 but when i tell him he hates flatterers
 he says he does being then most flattered
 let me work
 for i can give his humour the true bent
 and i will bring him to the capitol
cassius nay we will all of us be there to fetch him
brutus by the eighth hour is that the uttermost
cinna be that the uttermost and fail not then
metellus cimber caius ligarius doth bear caesar hard
 who rated him for speaking well of pompey
 i wonder none of you have thought of him
brutus now good metellus go along by him
 he loves me well and i have given him reasons
 send him but hither and i'll fashion him
cassius the morning comes upon s we'll leave you brutus
 and friends disperse yourselves but all remember
 what you have said and show yourselves true romans
brutus good gentlemen look fresh and merrily
 let not our looks put on our purposes
 but bear it as our roman actors do
 with untired spirits and formal constancy
 and so good morrow to you every one
 exeunt all but brutus
 boy lucius fast asleep it is no matter
 enjoy the honeyheavy dew of slumber
 thou hast no figures nor no fantasies
 which busy care draws in the brains of men
 therefore thou sleep'st so sound
 enter portia
portia brutus my lord
brutus portia what mean you wherefore rise you now
 it is not for your health thus to commit
 your weak condition to the raw cold morning
portia nor for yours neither you've ungently brutus
 stole from my bed and yesternight at supper
 you suddenly arose and walk'd about
 musing and sighing with your arms across
 and when i ask'd you what the matter was
 you stared upon me with ungentle looks
 i urged you further then you scratch'd your head
 and too impatiently stamp'd with your foot
 yet i insisted yet you answer'd not
 but with an angry wafture of your hand
 gave sign for me to leave you so i did
 fearing to strengthen that impatience
 which seem'd too much enkindled and withal
 hoping it was but an effect of humour
 which sometime hath his hour with every man
 it will not let you eat nor talk nor sleep
 and could it work so much upon your shape
 as it hath much prevail'd on your condition
 i should not know you brutus dear my lord
 make me acquainted with your cause of grief
brutus i am not well in health and that is all
portia brutus is wise and were he not in health
 he would embrace the means to come by it
brutus why so i do good portia go to bed
portia is brutus sick and is it physical
 to walk unbraced and suck up the humours
 of the dank morning what is brutus sick
 and will he steal out of his wholesome bed
 to dare the vile contagion of the night
 and tempt the rheumy and unpurged air
 to add unto his sickness no my brutus
 you have some sick offence within your mind
 which by the right and virtue of my place
 i ought to know of and upon my knees
 i charm you by my oncecommended beauty
 by all your vows of love and that great vow
 which did incorporate and make us one
 that you unfold to me yourself your half
 why you are heavy and what men tonight
 have had to resort to you for here have been
 some six or seven who did hide their faces
 even from darkness
brutus kneel not gentle portia
portia i should not need if you were gentle brutus
 within the bond of marriage tell me brutus
 is it excepted i should know no secrets
 that appertain to you am i yourself
 but as it were in sort or limitation
 to keep with you at meals comfort your bed
 and talk to you sometimes dwell i but in the suburbs
 of your good pleasure if it be no more
 portia is brutus harlot not his wife
brutus you are my true and honourable wife
 as dear to me as are the ruddy drops
 that visit my sad heart
portia if this were true then should i know this secret
 i grant i am a woman but withal
 a woman that lord brutus took to wife
 i grant i am a woman but withal
 a woman wellreputed cato's daughter
 think you i am no stronger than my sex
 being so father'd and so husbanded
 tell me your counsels i will not disclose em
 i have made strong proof of my constancy
 giving myself a voluntary wound
 here in the thigh can i bear that with patience
 and not my husband's secrets
brutus o ye gods
 render me worthy of this noble wife
 knocking within
 hark hark one knocks portia go in awhile
 and by and by thy bosom shall partake
 the secrets of my heart
 all my engagements i will construe to thee
 all the charactery of my sad brows
 leave me with haste
 exit portia
 lucius who's that knocks
 reenter lucius with ligarius
lucius he is a sick man that would speak with you
brutus caius ligarius that metellus spake of
 boy stand aside caius ligarius how
ligarius vouchsafe good morrow from a feeble tongue
brutus o what a time have you chose out brave caius
 to wear a kerchief would you were not sick
ligarius i am not sick if brutus have in hand
 any exploit worthy the name of honour
brutus such an exploit have i in hand ligarius
 had you a healthful ear to hear of it
ligarius by all the gods that romans bow before
 i here discard my sickness soul of rome
 brave son derived from honourable loins
 thou like an exorcist hast conjured up
 my mortified spirit now bid me run
 and i will strive with things impossible
 yea get the better of them what's to do
brutus a piece of work that will make sick men whole
ligarius but are not some whole that we must make sick
brutus that must we also what it is my caius
 i shall unfold to thee as we are going
 to whom it must be done
ligarius set on your foot
 and with a heart newfired i follow you
 to do i know not what but it sufficeth
 that brutus leads me on
brutus follow me then
 exeunt
 julius caesar
act ii
scene ii caesar's house
 thunder and lightning enter caesar in his
 nightgown
caesar nor heaven nor earth have been at peace tonight
 thrice hath calpurnia in her sleep cried out
 help ho they murder caesar who's within
 enter a servant
servant my lord
caesar go bid the priests do present sacrifice
 and bring me their opinions of success
servant i will my lord
 exit
 enter calpurnia
calpurnia what mean you caesar think you to walk forth
 you shall not stir out of your house today
caesar caesar shall forth the things that threaten'd me
 ne'er look'd but on my back when they shall see
 the face of caesar they are vanished
calpurnia caesar i never stood on ceremonies
 yet now they fright me there is one within
 besides the things that we have heard and seen
 recounts most horrid sights seen by the watch
 a lioness hath whelped in the streets
 and graves have yawn'd and yielded up their dead
 fierce fiery warriors fought upon the clouds
 in ranks and squadrons and right form of war
 which drizzled blood upon the capitol
 the noise of battle hurtled in the air
 horses did neigh and dying men did groan
 and ghosts did shriek and squeal about the streets
 o caesar these things are beyond all use
 and i do fear them
caesar what can be avoided
 whose end is purposed by the mighty gods
 yet caesar shall go forth for these predictions
 are to the world in general as to caesar
calpurnia when beggars die there are no comets seen
 the heavens themselves blaze forth the death of princes
caesar cowards die many times before their deaths
 the valiant never taste of death but once
 of all the wonders that i yet have heard
