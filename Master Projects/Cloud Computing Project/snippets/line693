edward tis even so yet you are warwick still
gloucester come warwick take the time kneel down kneel down
 nay when strike now or else the iron cools
warwick i had rather chop this hand off at a blow
 and with the other fling it at thy face
 than bear so low a sail to strike to thee
king edward iv sail how thou canst have wind and tide thy friend
 this hand fast wound about thy coalblack hair
 shall whiles thy head is warm and new cut off
 write in the dust this sentence with thy blood
 windchanging warwick now can change no more'
 enter oxford with drum and colours
warwick o cheerful colours see where oxford comes
oxford oxford oxford for lancaster
 he and his forces enter the city
gloucester the gates are open let us enter too
king edward iv so other foes may set upon our backs
 stand we in good array for they no doubt
 will issue out again and bid us battle
 if not the city being but of small defence
 we'll quickly rouse the traitors in the same
warwick o welcome oxford for we want thy help
 enter montague with drum and colours
montague montague montague for lancaster
 he and his forces enter the city
gloucester thou and thy brother both shall buy this treason
 even with the dearest blood your bodies bear
king edward iv the harder match'd the greater victory
 my mind presageth happy gain and conquest
 enter somerset with drum and colours
somerset somerset somerset for lancaster
 he and his forces enter the city
gloucester two of thy name both dukes of somerset
 have sold their lives unto the house of york
 and thou shalt be the third if this sword hold
 enter clarence with drum and colours
warwick and lo where george of clarence sweeps along
 of force enough to bid his brother battle
 with whom an upright zeal to right prevails
 more than the nature of a brother's love
 come clarence come thou wilt if warwick call
clarence father of warwick know you what this means
 taking his red rose out of his hat
 look here i throw my infamy at thee
 i will not ruinate my father's house
 who gave his blood to lime the stones together
 and set up lancaster why trow'st thou warwick
 that clarence is so harsh so blunt unnatural
 to bend the fatal instruments of war
 against his brother and his lawful king
 perhaps thou wilt object my holy oath
 to keep that oath were more impiety
 than jephthah's when he sacrificed his daughter
 i am so sorry for my trespass made
 that to deserve well at my brother's hands
 i here proclaim myself thy mortal foe
 with resolution wheresoe'er i meet thee
 as i will meet thee if thou stir abroad
 to plague thee for thy foul misleading me
 and so proudhearted warwick i defy thee
 and to my brother turn my blushing cheeks
 pardon me edward i will make amends
 and richard do not frown upon my faults
 for i will henceforth be no more unconstant
king edward iv now welcome more and ten times more beloved
 than if thou never hadst deserved our hate
gloucester welcome good clarence this is brotherlike
warwick o passing traitor perjured and unjust
king edward iv what warwick wilt thou leave the town and fight
 or shall we beat the stones about thine ears
warwick alas i am not coop'd here for defence
 i will away towards barnet presently
 and bid thee battle edward if thou darest
king edward iv yes warwick edward dares and leads the way
 lords to the field saint george and victory
 exeunt king edward and his company march warwick
 and his company follow

scene ii a field of battle near barnet
 alarum and excursions enter king edward iv bringing
 forth warwick wounded
king edward iv so lie thou there die thou and die our fear
 for warwick was a bug that fear'd us all
 now montague sit fast i seek for thee
 that warwick's bones may keep thine company
 exit
warwick ah who is nigh come to me friend or foe
 and tell me who is victor york or warwick
 why ask i that my mangled body shows
 my blood my want of strength my sick heart shows
 that i must yield my body to the earth
 and by my fall the conquest to my foe
 thus yields the cedar to the axe's edge
 whose arms gave shelter to the princely eagle
 under whose shade the ramping lion slept
 whose topbranch overpeer'd jove's spreading tree
 and kept low shrubs from winter's powerful wind
 these eyes that now are dimm'd with death's black veil
 have been as piercing as the midday sun
 to search the secret treasons of the world
 the wrinkles in my brows now filled with blood
 were liken'd oft to kingly sepulchres
 for who lived king but i could dig his grave
 and who durst mine when warwick bent his brow
 lo now my glory smear'd in dust and blood
 my parks my walks my manors that i had
 even now forsake me and of all my lands
 is nothing left me but my body's length
 why what is pomp rule reign but earth and dust
 and live we how we can yet die we must
 enter oxford and somerset
somerset ah warwick warwick wert thou as we are
 we might recover all our loss again
 the queen from france hath brought a puissant power
 even now we heard the news ah could'st thou fly
warwick why then i would not fly ah montague
 if thou be there sweet brother take my hand
 and with thy lips keep in my soul awhile
 thou lovest me not for brother if thou didst
 thy tears would wash this cold congealed blood
 that glues my lips and will not let me speak
 come quickly montague or i am dead
somerset ah warwick montague hath breathed his last
 and to the latest gasp cried out for warwick
 and said commend me to my valiant brother'
 and more he would have said and more he spoke
 which sounded like a clamour in a vault
 that mought not be distinguished but at last
 i well might hear delivered with a groan
 o farewell warwick'
warwick sweet rest his soul fly lords and save yourselves
 for warwick bids you all farewell to meet in heaven

scene iii another part of the field
 flourish enter king edward iv in triumph with
 gloucester clarence and the rest
king edward iv thus far our fortune keeps an upward course
 and we are graced with wreaths of victory
 but in the midst of this brightshining day
 i spy a black suspicious threatening cloud
 that will encounter with our glorious sun
 ere he attain his easeful western bed
 i mean my lords those powers that the queen
 hath raised in gallia have arrived our coast
 and as we hear march on to fight with us
clarence a little gale will soon disperse that cloud
 and blow it to the source from whence it came
 the very beams will dry those vapours up
 for every cloud engenders not a storm
gloucester the queen is valued thirty thousand strong
 and somerset with oxford fled to her
 if she have time to breathe be well assured
 her faction will be full as strong as ours
king edward iv we are advertised by our loving friends
 that they do hold their course toward tewksbury
 we having now the best at barnet field
 will thither straight for willingness rids way
 and as we march our strength will be augmented
 in every county as we go along
 strike up the drum cry courage and away

scene iv plains near tewksbury
 march enter queen margaret prince edward
 somerset oxford and soldiers
queen margaret great lords wise men ne'er sit and wail their loss
 but cheerly seek how to redress their harms
 what though the mast be now blown overboard
 the cable broke the holdinganchor lost
 and half our sailors swallow'd in the flood
 yet lives our pilot still is't meet that he
 should leave the helm and like a fearful lad
 with tearful eyes add water to the sea
 and give more strength to that which hath too much
 whiles in his moan the ship splits on the rock
 which industry and courage might have saved
 ah what a shame ah what a fault were this
 say warwick was our anchor what of that
 and montague our topmost what of him
 our slaughter'd friends the tackles what of these
 why is not oxford here another anchor
 and somerset another goodly mast
 the friends of france our shrouds and tacklings
 and though unskilful why not ned and i
 for once allow'd the skilful pilot's charge
 we will not from the helm to sit and weep
 but keep our course though the rough wind say no
 from shelves and rocks that threaten us with wreck
 as good to chide the waves as speak them fair
 and what is edward but ruthless sea
 what clarence but a quicksand of deceit
 and richard but a ragged fatal rock
 all these the enemies to our poor bark
 say you can swim alas tis but a while
