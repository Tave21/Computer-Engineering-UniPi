and said unto the woman now we believe not because of thy saying for we have heard him ourselves and know that this is indeed the christ the saviour of the world
now after two days he departed thence and went into galilee
for jesus himself testified that a prophet hath no honour in his own country
then when he was come into galilee the galilaeans received him having seen all the things that he did at jerusalem at the feast for they also went unto the feast
so jesus came again into cana of galilee where he made the water wine and there was a certain nobleman whose son was sick at capernaum
when he heard that jesus was come out of judaea into galilee he went unto him and besought him that he would come down and heal his son for he was at the point of death
then said jesus unto him except ye see signs and wonders ye will not believe
the nobleman saith unto him sir come down ere my child die
jesus saith unto him go thy way thy son liveth and the man believed the word that jesus had spoken unto him and he went his way
and as he was now going down his servants met him and told him saying thy son liveth
then enquired he of them the hour when he began to amend and they said unto him yesterday at the seventh hour the fever left him
so the father knew that it was at the same hour in the which jesus said unto him thy son liveth and himself believed and his whole house
this is again the second miracle that jesus did when he was come out of judaea into galilee
after this there was a feast of the jews and jesus went up to jerusalem
now there is at jerusalem by the sheep market a pool which is called in the hebrew tongue bethesda having five porches
in these lay a great multitude of impotent folk of blind halt withered waiting for the moving of the water
for an angel went down at a certain season into the pool and troubled the water whosoever then first after the troubling of the water stepped in was made whole of whatsoever disease he had
and a certain man was there which had an infirmity thirty and eight years
when jesus saw him lie and knew that he had been now a long time in that case he saith unto him wilt thou be made whole
the impotent man answered him sir i have no man when the water is troubled to put me into the pool but while i am coming another steppeth down before me
jesus saith unto him rise take up thy bed and walk
and immediately the man was made whole and took up his bed and walked and on the same day was the sabbath
the jews therefore said unto him that was cured it is the sabbath day it is not lawful for thee to carry thy bed
he answered them he that made me whole the same said unto me take up thy bed and walk
then asked they him what man is that which said unto thee take up thy bed and walk
and he that was healed wist not who it was for jesus had conveyed himself away a multitude being in that place
afterward jesus findeth him in the temple and said unto him behold thou art made whole sin no more lest a worse thing come unto thee
the man departed and told the jews that it was jesus which had made him whole
and therefore did the jews persecute jesus and sought to slay him because he had done these things on the sabbath day
but jesus answered them my father worketh hitherto and i work
therefore the jews sought the more to kill him because he not only had broken the sabbath but said also that god was his father making himself equal with god
then answered jesus and said unto them verily verily i say unto you the son can do nothing of himself but what he seeth the father do for what things soever he doeth these also doeth the son likewise
for the father loveth the son and sheweth him all things that himself doeth and he will shew him greater works than these that ye may marvel
for as the father raiseth up the dead and quickeneth them even so the son quickeneth whom he will
for the father judgeth no man but hath committed all judgment unto the son
that all men should honour the son even as they honour the father he that honoureth not the son honoureth not the father which hath sent him
verily verily i say unto you he that heareth my word and believeth on him that sent me hath everlasting life and shall not come into condemnation but is passed from death unto life
verily verily i say unto you the hour is coming and now is when the dead shall hear the voice of the son of god and they that hear shall live
for as the father hath life in himself so hath he given to the son to have life in himself
and hath given him authority to execute judgment also because he is the son of man
marvel not at this for the hour is coming in the which all that are in the graves shall hear his voice
and shall come forth they that have done good unto the resurrection of life and they that have done evil unto the resurrection of damnation
i can of mine own self do nothing as i hear i judge and my judgment is just because i seek not mine own will but the will of the father which hath sent me
if i bear witness of myself my witness is not true
there is another that beareth witness of me and i know that the witness which he witnesseth of me is true
ye sent unto john and he bare witness unto the truth
but i receive not testimony from man but these things i say that ye might be saved
he was a burning and a shining light and ye were willing for a season to rejoice in his light
but i have greater witness than that of john for the works which the father hath given me to finish the same works that i do bear witness of me that the father hath sent me
and the father himself which hath sent me hath borne witness of me ye have neither heard his voice at any time nor seen his shape
and ye have not his word abiding in you for whom he hath sent him ye believe not
search the scriptures for in them ye think ye have eternal life and they are they which testify of me
and ye will not come to me that ye might have life
i receive not honour from men
but i know you that ye have not the love of god in you
i am come in my father's name and ye receive me not if another shall come in his own name him ye will receive
how can ye believe which receive honour one of another and seek not the honour that cometh from god only
do not think that i will accuse you to the father there is one that accuseth you even moses in whom ye trust
for had ye believed moses ye would have believed me for he wrote of me
but if ye believe not his writings how shall ye believe my words
after these things jesus went over the sea of galilee which is the sea of tiberias
and a great multitude followed him because they saw his miracles which he did on them that were diseased
and jesus went up into a mountain and there he sat with his disciples
and the passover a feast of the jews was nigh
when jesus then lifted up his eyes and saw a great company come unto him he saith unto philip whence shall we buy bread that these may eat
and this he said to prove him for he himself knew what he would do
philip answered him two hundred pennyworth of bread is not sufficient for them that every one of them may take a little
one of his disciples andrew simon peter's brother saith unto him
there is a lad here which hath five barley loaves and two small fishes but what are they among so many
and jesus said make the men sit down now there was much grass in the place so the men sat down in number about five thousand
and jesus took the loaves and when he had given thanks he distributed to the disciples and the disciples to them that were set down and likewise of the fishes as much as they would
when they were filled he said unto his disciples gather up the fragments that remain that nothing be lost
therefore they gathered them together and filled twelve baskets with the fragments of the five barley loaves which remained over and above unto them that had eaten
then those men when they had seen the miracle that jesus did said this is of a truth that prophet that should come into the world
when jesus therefore perceived that they would come and take him by force to make him a king he departed again into a mountain himself alone
and when even was now come his disciples went down unto the sea
and entered into a ship and went over the sea toward capernaum and it was now dark and jesus was not come to them
and the sea arose by reason of a great wind that blew
so when they had rowed about five and twenty or thirty furlongs they see jesus walking on the sea and drawing nigh unto the ship and they were afraid
but he saith unto them it is i be not afraid
then they willingly received him into the ship and immediately the ship was at the land whither they went
the day following when the people which stood on the other side of the sea saw that there was none other boat there save that one whereinto his disciples were entered and that jesus went not with his disciples into the boat but that his disciples were gone away alone
howbeit there came other boats from tiberias nigh unto the place where they did eat bread after that the lord had given thanks
when the people therefore saw that jesus was not there neither his disciples they also took shipping and came to capernaum seeking for jesus
and when they had found him on the other side of the sea they said unto him rabbi when camest thou hither
jesus answered them and said verily verily i say unto you ye seek me not because ye saw the miracles but because ye did eat of the loaves and were filled
labour not for the meat which perisheth but for that meat which endureth unto everlasting life which the son of man shall give unto you for him hath god the father sealed
then said they unto him what shall we do that we might work the works of god
jesus answered and said unto them this is the work of god that ye believe on him whom he hath sent
they said therefore unto him what sign shewest thou then that we may see and believe thee what dost thou work
our fathers did eat manna in the desert as it is written he gave them bread from heaven to eat
then jesus said unto them verily verily i say unto you moses gave you not that bread from heaven but my father giveth you the true bread from heaven
for the bread of god is he which cometh down from heaven and giveth life unto the world
then said they unto him lord evermore give us this bread
and jesus said unto them i am the bread of life he that cometh to me shall never hunger and he that believeth on me shall never thirst
but i said unto you that ye also have seen me and believe not
all that the father giveth me shall come to me and him that cometh to me i will in no wise cast out
for i came down from heaven not to do mine own will but the will of him that sent me
and this is the father's will which hath sent me that of all which he hath given me i should lose nothing but should raise it up again at the last day
and this is the will of him that sent me that every one which seeth the son and believeth on him may have everlasting life and i will raise him up at the last day
the jews then murmured at him because he said i am the bread which came down from heaven
and they said is not this jesus the son of joseph whose father and mother we know how is it then that he saith i came down from heaven
jesus therefore answered and said unto them murmur not among yourselves
no man can come to me except the father which hath sent me draw him and i will raise him up at the last day
it is written in the prophets and they shall be all taught of god every man therefore that hath heard and hath learned of the father cometh unto me
not that any man hath seen the father save he which is of god he hath seen the father
verily verily i say unto you he that believeth on me hath everlasting life
i am that bread of life
your fathers did eat manna in the wilderness and are dead
this is the bread which cometh down from heaven that a man may eat thereof and not die
i am the living bread which came down from heaven if any man eat of this bread he shall live for ever and the bread that i will give is my flesh which i will give for the life of the world
the jews therefore strove among themselves saying how can this man give us his flesh to eat
then jesus said unto them verily verily i say unto you except ye eat the flesh of the son of man and drink his blood ye have no life in you
whoso eateth my flesh and drinketh my blood hath eternal life and i will raise him up at the last day
for my flesh is meat indeed and my blood is drink indeed
he that eateth my flesh and drinketh my blood dwelleth in me and i in him
as the living father hath sent me and i live by the father so he that eateth me even he shall live by me
this is that bread which came down from heaven not as your fathers did eat manna and are dead he that eateth of this bread shall live for ever
these things said he in the synagogue as he taught in capernaum
many therefore of his disciples when they had heard this said this is an hard saying who can hear it
when jesus knew in himself that his disciples murmured at it he said unto them doth this offend you
what and if ye shall see the son of man ascend up where he was before
it is the spirit that quickeneth the flesh profiteth nothing the words that i speak unto you they are spirit and they are life
but there are some of you that believe not for jesus knew from the beginning who they were that believed not and who should betray him
and he said therefore said i unto you that no man can come unto me except it were given unto him of my father
from that time many of his disciples went back and walked no more with him
then said jesus unto the twelve will ye also go away
then simon peter answered him lord to whom shall we go thou hast the words of eternal life
and we believe and are sure that thou art that christ the son of the living god
jesus answered them have not i chosen you twelve and one of you is a devil
he spake of judas iscariot the son of simon for he it was that should betray him being one of the twelve
after these things jesus walked in galilee for he would not walk in jewry because the jews sought to kill him
now the jews feast of tabernacles was at hand
his brethren therefore said unto him depart hence and go into judaea that thy disciples also may see the works that thou doest
for there is no man that doeth any thing in secret and he himself seeketh to be known openly if thou do these things shew thyself to the world
for neither did his brethren believe in him
then jesus said unto them my time is not yet come but your time is alway ready
the world cannot hate you but me it hateth because i testify of it that the works thereof are evil
go ye up unto this feast i go not up yet unto this feast for my time is not yet full come
when he had said these words unto them he abode still in galilee
but when his brethren were gone up then went he also up unto the feast not openly but as it were in secret
then the jews sought him at the feast and said where is he
and there was much murmuring among the people concerning him for some said he is a good man others said nay but he deceiveth the people
howbeit no man spake openly of him for fear of the jews
now about the midst of the feast jesus went up into the temple and taught
and the jews marvelled saying how knoweth this man letters having never learned
jesus answered them and said my doctrine is not mine but his that sent me
if any man will do his will he shall know of the doctrine whether it be of god or whether i speak of myself
he that speaketh of himself seeketh his own glory but he that seeketh his glory that sent him the same is true and no unrighteousness is in him
did not moses give you the law and yet none of you keepeth the law why go ye about to kill me
the people answered and said thou hast a devil who goeth about to kill thee
jesus answered and said unto them i have done one work and ye all marvel
moses therefore gave unto you circumcision not because it is of moses but of the fathers and ye on the sabbath day circumcise a man
if a man on the sabbath day receive circumcision that the law of moses should not be broken are ye angry at me because i have made a man every whit whole on the sabbath day
judge not according to the appearance but judge righteous judgment
then said some of them of jerusalem is not this he whom they seek to kill
but lo he speaketh boldly and they say nothing unto him do the rulers know indeed that this is the very christ
howbeit we know this man whence he is but when christ cometh no man knoweth whence he is
then cried jesus in the temple as he taught saying ye both know me and ye know whence i am and i am not come of myself but he that sent me is true whom ye know not
but i know him for i am from him and he hath sent me
then they sought to take him but no man laid hands on him because his hour was not yet come
and many of the people believed on him and said when christ cometh will he do more miracles than these which this man hath done
the pharisees heard that the people murmured such things concerning him and the pharisees and the chief priests sent officers to take him
then said jesus unto them yet a little while am i with you and then i go unto him that sent me
ye shall seek me and shall not find me and where i am thither ye cannot come
then said the jews among themselves whither will he go that we shall not find him will he go unto the dispersed among the gentiles and teach the gentiles
what manner of saying is this that he said ye shall seek me and shall not find me and where i am thither ye cannot come
in the last day that great day of the feast jesus stood and cried saying if any man thirst let him come unto me and drink
he that believeth on me as the scripture hath said out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water
but this spake he of the spirit which they that believe on him should receive for the holy ghost was not yet given because that jesus was not yet glorified
many of the people therefore when they heard this saying said of a truth this is the prophet
others said this is the christ but some said shall christ come out of galilee
hath not the scripture said that christ cometh of the seed of david and out of the town of bethlehem where david was
so there was a division among the people because of him
and some of them would have taken him but no man laid hands on him
then came the officers to the chief priests and pharisees and they said unto them why have ye not brought him
the officers answered never man spake like this man
then answered them the pharisees are ye also deceived
have any of the rulers or of the pharisees believed on him
but this people who knoweth not the law are cursed
nicodemus saith unto them he that came to jesus by night being one of them
doth our law judge any man before it hear him and know what he doeth
they answered and said unto him art thou also of galilee search and look for out of galilee ariseth no prophet
and every man went unto his own house
jesus went unto the mount of olives
and early in the morning he came again into the temple and all the people came unto him and he sat down and taught them
and the scribes and pharisees brought unto him a woman taken in adultery and when they had set her in the midst
they say unto him master this woman was taken in adultery in the very act
now moses in the law commanded us that such should be stoned but what sayest thou
this they said tempting him that they might have to accuse him but jesus stooped down and with his finger wrote on the ground as though he heard them not
so when they continued asking him he lifted up himself and said unto them he that is without sin among you let him first cast a stone at her
and again he stooped down and wrote on the ground
and they which heard it being convicted by their own conscience went out one by one beginning at the eldest even unto the last and jesus was left alone and the woman standing in the midst
when jesus had lifted up himself and saw none but the woman he said unto her woman where are those thine accusers hath no man condemned thee
she said no man lord and jesus said unto her neither do i condemn thee go and sin no more
then spake jesus again unto them saying i am the light of the world he that followeth me shall not walk in darkness but shall have the light of life
the pharisees therefore said unto him thou bearest record of thyself thy record is not true
jesus answered and said unto them though i bear record of myself yet my record is true for i know whence i came and whither i go but ye cannot tell whence i come and whither i go
ye judge after the flesh i judge no man
and yet if i judge my judgment is true for i am not alone but i and the father that sent me
