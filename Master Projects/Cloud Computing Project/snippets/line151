esteeming the reproach of christ greater riches than the treasures in egypt for he had respect unto the recompence of the reward
by faith he forsook egypt not fearing the wrath of the king for he endured as seeing him who is invisible
through faith he kept the passover and the sprinkling of blood lest he that destroyed the firstborn should touch them
by faith they passed through the red sea as by dry land which the egyptians assaying to do were drowned
by faith the walls of jericho fell down after they were compassed about seven days
by faith the harlot rahab perished not with them that believed not when she had received the spies with peace
and what shall i more say for the time would fail me to tell of gedeon and of barak and of samson and of jephthae of david also and samuel and of the prophets
who through faith subdued kingdoms wrought righteousness obtained promises stopped the mouths of lions
quenched the violence of fire escaped the edge of the sword out of weakness were made strong waxed valiant in fight turned to flight the armies of the aliens
women received their dead raised to life again and others were tortured not accepting deliverance that they might obtain a better resurrection
and others had trial of cruel mockings and scourgings yea moreover of bonds and imprisonment
they were stoned they were sawn asunder were tempted were slain with the sword they wandered about in sheepskins and goatskins being destitute afflicted tormented
of whom the world was not worthy they wandered in deserts and in mountains and in dens and caves of the earth
and these all having obtained a good report through faith received not the promise
god having provided some better thing for us that they without us should not be made perfect
wherefore seeing we also are compassed about with so great a cloud of witnesses let us lay aside every weight and the sin which doth so easily beset us and let us run with patience the race that is set before us
looking unto jesus the author and finisher of our faith who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross despising the shame and is set down at the right hand of the throne of god
for consider him that endured such contradiction of sinners against himself lest ye be wearied and faint in your minds
ye have not yet resisted unto blood striving against sin
and ye have forgotten the exhortation which speaketh unto you as unto children my son despise not thou the chastening of the lord nor faint when thou art rebuked of him
for whom the lord loveth he chasteneth and scourgeth every son whom he receiveth
if ye endure chastening god dealeth with you as with sons for what son is he whom the father chasteneth not
but if ye be without chastisement whereof all are partakers then are ye bastards and not sons
furthermore we have had fathers of our flesh which corrected us and we gave them reverence shall we not much rather be in subjection unto the father of spirits and live
for they verily for a few days chastened us after their own pleasure but he for our profit that we might be partakers of his holiness
now no chastening for the present seemeth to be joyous but grievous nevertheless afterward it yieldeth the peaceable fruit of righteousness unto them which are exercised thereby
wherefore lift up the hands which hang down and the feeble knees
and make straight paths for your feet lest that which is lame be turned out of the way but let it rather be healed
follow peace with all men and holiness without which no man shall see the lord
looking diligently lest any man fail of the grace of god lest any root of bitterness springing up trouble you and thereby many be defiled
lest there be any fornicator or profane person as esau who for one morsel of meat sold his birthright
for ye know how that afterward when he would have inherited the blessing he was rejected for he found no place of repentance though he sought it carefully with tears
for ye are not come unto the mount that might be touched and that burned with fire nor unto blackness and darkness and tempest
and the sound of a trumpet and the voice of words which voice they that heard intreated that the word should not be spoken to them any more
for they could not endure that which was commanded and if so much as a beast touch the mountain it shall be stoned or thrust through with a dart
and so terrible was the sight that moses said i exceedingly fear and quake
but ye are come unto mount sion and unto the city of the living god the heavenly jerusalem and to an innumerable company of angels
to the general assembly and church of the firstborn which are written in heaven and to god the judge of all and to the spirits of just men made perfect
and to jesus the mediator of the new covenant and to the blood of sprinkling that speaketh better things than that of abel
see that ye refuse not him that speaketh for if they escaped not who refused him that spake on earth much more shall not we escape if we turn away from him that speaketh from heaven
whose voice then shook the earth but now he hath promised saying yet once more i shake not the earth only but also heaven
and this word yet once more signifieth the removing of those things that are shaken as of things that are made that those things which cannot be shaken may remain
wherefore we receiving a kingdom which cannot be moved let us have grace whereby we may serve god acceptably with reverence and godly fear
for our god is a consuming fire
let brotherly love continue
be not forgetful to entertain strangers for thereby some have entertained angels unawares
remember them that are in bonds as bound with them and them which suffer adversity as being yourselves also in the body
marriage is honourable in all and the bed undefiled but whoremongers and adulterers god will judge
let your conversation be without covetousness and be content with such things as ye have for he hath said i will never leave thee nor forsake thee
so that we may boldly say the lord is my helper and i will not fear what man shall do unto me
remember them which have the rule over you who have spoken unto you the word of god whose faith follow considering the end of their conversation
jesus christ the same yesterday and to day and for ever
be not carried about with divers and strange doctrines for it is a good thing that the heart be established with grace not with meats which have not profited them that have been occupied therein
we have an altar whereof they have no right to eat which serve the tabernacle
for the bodies of those beasts whose blood is brought into the sanctuary by the high priest for sin are burned without the camp
wherefore jesus also that he might sanctify the people with his own blood suffered without the gate
let us go forth therefore unto him without the camp bearing his reproach
for here have we no continuing city but we seek one to come
by him therefore let us offer the sacrifice of praise to god continually that is the fruit of our lips giving thanks to his name
but to do good and to communicate forget not for with such sacrifices god is well pleased
obey them that have the rule over you and submit yourselves for they watch for your souls as they that must give account that they may do it with joy and not with grief for that is unprofitable for you
pray for us for we trust we have a good conscience in all things willing to live honestly
but i beseech you the rather to do this that i may be restored to you the sooner
now the god of peace that brought again from the dead our lord jesus that great shepherd of the sheep through the blood of the everlasting covenant
make you perfect in every good work to do his will working in you that which is wellpleasing in his sight through jesus christ to whom be glory for ever and ever amen
and i beseech you brethren suffer the word of exhortation for i have written a letter unto you in few words
know ye that our brother timothy is set at liberty with whom if he come shortly i will see you
salute all them that have the rule over you and all the saints they of italy salute you
grace be with you all amen
james a servant of god and of the lord jesus christ to the twelve tribes which are scattered abroad greeting
my brethren count it all joy when ye fall into divers temptations
knowing this that the trying of your faith worketh patience
but let patience have her perfect work that ye may be perfect and entire wanting nothing
if any of you lack wisdom let him ask of god that giveth to all men liberally and upbraideth not and it shall be given him
but let him ask in faith nothing wavering for he that wavereth is like a wave of the sea driven with the wind and tossed
for let not that man think that he shall receive any thing of the lord
a double minded man is unstable in all his ways
let the brother of low degree rejoice in that he is exalted
but the rich in that he is made low because as the flower of the grass he shall pass away
for the sun is no sooner risen with a burning heat but it withereth the grass and the flower thereof falleth and the grace of the fashion of it perisheth so also shall the rich man fade away in his ways
blessed is the man that endureth temptation for when he is tried he shall receive the crown of life which the lord hath promised to them that love him
let no man say when he is tempted i am tempted of god for god cannot be tempted with evil neither tempteth he any man
but every man is tempted when he is drawn away of his own lust and enticed
then when lust hath conceived it bringeth forth sin and sin when it is finished bringeth forth death
do not err my beloved brethren
every good gift and every perfect gift is from above and cometh down from the father of lights with whom is no variableness neither shadow of turning
of his own will begat he us with the word of truth that we should be a kind of firstfruits of his creatures
wherefore my beloved brethren let every man be swift to hear slow to speak slow to wrath
for the wrath of man worketh not the righteousness of god
wherefore lay apart all filthiness and superfluity of naughtiness and receive with meekness the engrafted word which is able to save your souls
but be ye doers of the word and not hearers only deceiving your own selves
for if any be a hearer of the word and not a doer he is like unto a man beholding his natural face in a glass
for he beholdeth himself and goeth his way and straightway forgetteth what manner of man he was
but whoso looketh into the perfect law of liberty and continueth therein he being not a forgetful hearer but a doer of the work this man shall be blessed in his deed
if any man among you seem to be religious and bridleth not his tongue but deceiveth his own heart this man's religion is vain
pure religion and undefiled before god and the father is this to visit the fatherless and widows in their affliction and to keep himself unspotted from the world
my brethren have not the faith of our lord jesus christ the lord of glory with respect of persons
for if there come unto your assembly a man with a gold ring in goodly apparel and there come in also a poor man in vile raiment
and ye have respect to him that weareth the gay clothing and say unto him sit thou here in a good place and say to the poor stand thou there or sit here under my footstool
are ye not then partial in yourselves and are become judges of evil thoughts
hearken my beloved brethren hath not god chosen the poor of this world rich in faith and heirs of the kingdom which he hath promised to them that love him
but ye have despised the poor do not rich men oppress you and draw you before the judgment seats
do not they blaspheme that worthy name by the which ye are called
if ye fulfil the royal law according to the scripture thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself ye do well
but if ye have respect to persons ye commit sin and are convinced of the law as transgressors
for whosoever shall keep the whole law and yet offend in one point he is guilty of all
for he that said do not commit adultery said also do not kill now if thou commit no adultery yet if thou kill thou art become a transgressor of the law
so speak ye and so do as they that shall be judged by the law of liberty
for he shall have judgment without mercy that hath shewed no mercy and mercy rejoiceth against judgment
what doth it profit my brethren though a man say he hath faith and have not works can faith save him
if a brother or sister be naked and destitute of daily food
and one of you say unto them depart in peace be ye warmed and filled notwithstanding ye give them not those things which are needful to the body what doth it profit
even so faith if it hath not works is dead being alone
yea a man may say thou hast faith and i have works shew me thy faith without thy works and i will shew thee my faith by my works
thou believest that there is one god thou doest well the devils also believe and tremble
but wilt thou know o vain man that faith without works is dead
was not abraham our father justified by works when he had offered isaac his son upon the altar
seest thou how faith wrought with his works and by works was faith made perfect
and the scripture was fulfilled which saith abraham believed god and it was imputed unto him for righteousness and he was called the friend of god
ye see then how that by works a man is justified and not by faith only
likewise also was not rahab the harlot justified by works when she had received the messengers and had sent them out another way
for as the body without the spirit is dead so faith without works is dead also
my brethren be not many masters knowing that we shall receive the greater condemnation
for in many things we offend all if any man offend not in word the same is a perfect man and able also to bridle the whole body
behold we put bits in the horses mouths that they may obey us and we turn about their whole body
behold also the ships which though they be so great and are driven of fierce winds yet are they turned about with a very small helm whithersoever the governor listeth
even so the tongue is a little member and boasteth great things behold how great a matter a little fire kindleth
and the tongue is a fire a world of iniquity so is the tongue among our members that it defileth the whole body and setteth on fire the course of nature and it is set on fire of hell
for every kind of beasts and of birds and of serpents and of things in the sea is tamed and hath been tamed of mankind
but the tongue can no man tame it is an unruly evil full of deadly poison
therewith bless we god even the father and therewith curse we men which are made after the similitude of god
out of the same mouth proceedeth blessing and cursing my brethren these things ought not so to be
doth a fountain send forth at the same place sweet water and bitter
can the fig tree my brethren bear olive berries either a vine figs so can no fountain both yield salt water and fresh
who is a wise man and endued with knowledge among you let him shew out of a good conversation his works with meekness of wisdom
but if ye have bitter envying and strife in your hearts glory not and lie not against the truth
this wisdom descendeth not from above but is earthly sensual devilish
for where envying and strife is there is confusion and every evil work
but the wisdom that is from above is first pure then peaceable gentle and easy to be intreated full of mercy and good fruits without partiality and without hypocrisy
and the fruit of righteousness is sown in peace of them that make peace
from whence come wars and fightings among you come they not hence even of your lusts that war in your members
ye lust and have not ye kill and desire to have and cannot obtain ye fight and war yet ye have not because ye ask not
ye ask and receive not because ye ask amiss that ye may consume it upon your lusts
ye adulterers and adulteresses know ye not that the friendship of the world is enmity with god whosoever therefore will be a friend of the world is the enemy of god
do ye think that the scripture saith in vain the spirit that dwelleth in us lusteth to envy
but he giveth more grace wherefore he saith god resisteth the proud but giveth grace unto the humble
submit yourselves therefore to god resist the devil and he will flee from you
draw nigh to god and he will draw nigh to you cleanse your hands ye sinners and purify your hearts ye double minded
be afflicted and mourn and weep let your laughter be turned to mourning and your joy to heaviness
humble yourselves in the sight of the lord and he shall lift you up
speak not evil one of another brethren he that speaketh evil of his brother and judgeth his brother speaketh evil of the law and judgeth the law but if thou judge the law thou art not a doer of the law but a judge
there is one lawgiver who is able to save and to destroy who art thou that judgest another
go to now ye that say to day or to morrow we will go into such a city and continue there a year and buy and sell and get gain
whereas ye know not what shall be on the morrow for what is your life it is even a vapour that appeareth for a little time and then vanisheth away
for that ye ought to say if the lord will we shall live and do this or that
but now ye rejoice in your boastings all such rejoicing is evil
therefore to him that knoweth to do good and doeth it not to him it is sin
go to now ye rich men weep and howl for your miseries that shall come upon you
your riches are corrupted and your garments are motheaten
your gold and silver is cankered and the rust of them shall be a witness against you and shall eat your flesh as it were fire ye have heaped treasure together for the last days
behold the hire of the labourers who have reaped down your fields which is of you kept back by fraud crieth and the cries of them which have reaped are entered into the ears of the lord of sabaoth
ye have lived in pleasure on the earth and been wanton ye have nourished your hearts as in a day of slaughter
ye have condemned and killed the just and he doth not resist you
be patient therefore brethren unto the coming of the lord behold the husbandman waiteth for the precious fruit of the earth and hath long patience for it until he receive the early and latter rain
be ye also patient stablish your hearts for the coming of the lord draweth nigh
grudge not one against another brethren lest ye be condemned behold the judge standeth before the door
take my brethren the prophets who have spoken in the name of the lord for an example of suffering affliction and of patience
behold we count them happy which endure ye have heard of the patience of job and have seen the end of the lord that the lord is very pitiful and of tender mercy
but above all things my brethren swear not neither by heaven neither by the earth neither by any other oath but let your yea be yea and your nay nay lest ye fall into condemnation
is any among you afflicted let him pray is any merry let him sing psalms
is any sick among you let him call for the elders of the church and let them pray over him anointing him with oil in the name of the lord
and the prayer of faith shall save the sick and the lord shall raise him up and if he have committed sins they shall be forgiven him
confess your faults one to another and pray one for another that ye may be healed the effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man availeth much
elias was a man subject to like passions as we are and he prayed earnestly that it might not rain and it rained not on the earth by the space of three years and six months
and he prayed again and the heaven gave rain and the earth brought forth her fruit
brethren if any of you do err from the truth and one convert him
let him know that he which converteth the sinner from the error of his way shall save a soul from death and shall hide a multitude of sins
1pet11 peter an apostle of jesus christ to the strangers scattered throughout pontus galatia cappadocia asia and bithynia
1pet12 elect according to the foreknowledge of god the father through sanctification of the spirit unto obedience and sprinkling of the blood of jesus christ grace unto you and peace be multiplied

1pet15 who are kept by the power of god through faith unto salvation ready to be revealed in the last time
1pet16 wherein ye greatly rejoice though now for a season if need be ye are in heaviness through manifold temptations
1pet17 that the trial of your faith being much more precious than of gold that perisheth though it be tried with fire might be found unto praise and honour and glory at the appearing of jesus christ
1pet18 whom having not seen ye love in whom though now ye see him not yet believing ye rejoice with joy unspeakable and full of glory
1pet19 receiving the end of your faith even the salvation of your souls
1pet110 of which salvation the prophets have enquired and searched diligently who prophesied of the grace that should come unto you
1pet111 searching what or what manner of time the spirit of christ which was in them did signify when it testified beforehand the sufferings of christ and the glory that should follow
1pet112 unto whom it was revealed that not unto themselves but unto us they did minister the things which are now reported unto you by them that have preached the gospel unto you with the holy ghost sent down from heaven which things the angels desire to look into
1pet113 wherefore gird up the loins of your mind be sober and hope to the end for the grace that is to be brought unto you at the revelation of jesus christ
1pet114 as obedient children not fashioning yourselves according to the former lusts in your ignorance
1pet115 but as he which hath called you is holy so be ye holy in all manner of conversation
1pet116 because it is written be ye holy for i am holy
1pet117 and if ye call on the father who without respect of persons judgeth according to every man's work pass the time of your sojourning here in fear
1pet118 forasmuch as ye know that ye were not redeemed with corruptible things as silver and gold from your vain conversation received by tradition from your fathers
1pet119 but with the precious blood of christ as of a lamb without blemish and without spot
1pet120 who verily was foreordained before the foundation of the world but was manifest in these last times for you
1pet121 who by him do believe in god that raised him up from the dead and gave him glory that your faith and hope might be in god
1pet122 seeing ye have purified your souls in obeying the truth through the spirit unto unfeigned love of the brethren see that ye love one another with a pure heart fervently
1pet123 being born again not of corruptible seed but of incorruptible by the word of god which liveth and abideth for ever
