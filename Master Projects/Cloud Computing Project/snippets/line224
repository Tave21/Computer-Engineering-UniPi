 it seems to me most strange that men should fear
 seeing that death a necessary end
 will come when it will come
 reenter servant
 what say the augurers
servant they would not have you to stir forth today
 plucking the entrails of an offering forth
 they could not find a heart within the beast
caesar the gods do this in shame of cowardice
 caesar should be a beast without a heart
 if he should stay at home today for fear
 no caesar shall not danger knows full well
 that caesar is more dangerous than he
 we are two lions litter'd in one day
 and i the elder and more terrible
 and caesar shall go forth
calpurnia alas my lord
 your wisdom is consumed in confidence
 do not go forth today call it my fear
 that keeps you in the house and not your own
 we'll send mark antony to the senatehouse
 and he shall say you are not well today
 let me upon my knee prevail in this
caesar mark antony shall say i am not well
 and for thy humour i will stay at home
 enter decius brutus
 here's decius brutus he shall tell them so
decius brutus caesar all hail good morrow worthy caesar
 i come to fetch you to the senatehouse
caesar and you are come in very happy time
 to bear my greeting to the senators
 and tell them that i will not come today
 cannot is false and that i dare not falser
 i will not come today tell them so decius
calpurnia say he is sick
caesar shall caesar send a lie
 have i in conquest stretch'd mine arm so far
 to be afraid to tell graybeards the truth
 decius go tell them caesar will not come
decius brutus most mighty caesar let me know some cause
 lest i be laugh'd at when i tell them so
caesar the cause is in my will i will not come
 that is enough to satisfy the senate
 but for your private satisfaction
 because i love you i will let you know
 calpurnia here my wife stays me at home
 she dreamt tonight she saw my statua
 which like a fountain with an hundred spouts
 did run pure blood and many lusty romans
 came smiling and did bathe their hands in it
 and these does she apply for warnings and portents
 and evils imminent and on her knee
 hath begg'd that i will stay at home today
decius brutus this dream is all amiss interpreted
 it was a vision fair and fortunate
 your statue spouting blood in many pipes
 in which so many smiling romans bathed
 signifies that from you great rome shall suck
 reviving blood and that great men shall press
 for tinctures stains relics and cognizance
 this by calpurnia's dream is signified
caesar and this way have you well expounded it
decius brutus i have when you have heard what i can say
 and know it now the senate have concluded
 to give this day a crown to mighty caesar
 if you shall send them word you will not come
 their minds may change besides it were a mock
 apt to be render'd for some one to say
 break up the senate till another time
 when caesar's wife shall meet with better dreams'
 if caesar hide himself shall they not whisper
 lo caesar is afraid'
 pardon me caesar for my dear dear love
 to our proceeding bids me tell you this
 and reason to my love is liable
caesar how foolish do your fears seem now calpurnia
 i am ashamed i did yield to them
 give me my robe for i will go
 enter publius brutus ligarius metellus casca
 trebonius and cinna
 and look where publius is come to fetch me
publius good morrow caesar
caesar welcome publius
 what brutus are you stirr'd so early too
 good morrow casca caius ligarius
 caesar was ne'er so much your enemy
 as that same ague which hath made you lean
 what is t o'clock
brutus caesar tis strucken eight
caesar i thank you for your pains and courtesy
 enter antony
 see antony that revels long o nights
 is notwithstanding up good morrow antony
antony so to most noble caesar
caesar bid them prepare within

 the mighty gods defend thee thy lover
 artemidorus'
 here will i stand till caesar pass along
 and as a suitor will i give him this
 my heart laments that virtue cannot live
 out of the teeth of emulation

scene iv another part of the same street before the house of brutus
 enter portia and lucius
portia i prithee boy run to the senatehouse
 stay not to answer me but get thee gone
 why dost thou stay
lucius to know my errand madam
portia i would have had thee there and here again
 ere i can tell thee what thou shouldst do there
 o constancy be strong upon my side
 set a huge mountain tween my heart and tongue
 i have a man's mind but a woman's might
 how hard it is for women to keep counsel
 art thou here yet
lucius madam what should i do
 run to the capitol and nothing else
 and so return to you and nothing else
portia yes bring me word boy if thy lord look well
 for he went sickly forth and take good note
 what caesar doth what suitors press to him
 hark boy what noise is that
lucius i hear none madam
portia prithee listen well
 i heard a bustling rumour like a fray
 and the wind brings it from the capitol
lucius sooth madam i hear nothing

portia come hither fellow which way hast thou been
soothsayer at mine own house good lady
portia what is't o'clock

 to see him pass on to the capitol
portia thou hast some suit to caesar hast thou not
soothsayer that i have lady if it will please caesar
 to be so good to caesar as to hear me
 i shall beseech him to befriend himself
portia why know'st thou any harm's intended towards him
soothsayer none that i know will be much that i fear may chance
 good morrow to you here the street is narrow
 the throng that follows caesar at the heels
 of senators of praetors common suitors
 will crowd a feeble man almost to death
 i'll get me to a place more void and there
 speak to great caesar as he comes along
 exit
portia i must go in ay me how weak a thing
 the heart of woman is o brutus
 the heavens speed thee in thine enterprise
 sure the boy heard me brutus hath a suit
 that caesar will not grant o i grow faint
 run lucius and commend me to my lord
 say i am merry come to me again
 and bring me word what he doth say to thee
 exeunt severally
