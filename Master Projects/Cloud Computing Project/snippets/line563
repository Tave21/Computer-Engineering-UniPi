 and that which looks like pride is courtesy
 this ajax is half made of hector's blood
 in love whereof half hector stays at home
 half heart half hand half hector comes to seek
 this blended knight half trojan and half greek
achilles a maiden battle then o i perceive you
 reenter diomedes
agamemnon here is sir diomed go gentle knight
 stand by our ajax as you and lord aeneas
 consent upon the order of their fight
 so be it either to the uttermost
 or else a breath the combatants being kin
 half stints their strife before their strokes begin
 ajax and hector enter the lists
ulysses they are opposed already
agamemnon what trojan is that same that looks so heavy
ulysses the youngest son of priam a true knight
 not yet mature yet matchless firm of word
 speaking in deeds and deedless in his tongue
 not soon provoked nor being provoked soon calm'd
 his heart and hand both open and both free
 for what he has he gives what thinks he shows
 yet gives he not till judgment guide his bounty
 nor dignifies an impure thought with breath
 manly as hector but more dangerous
 for hector in his blaze of wrath subscribes
 to tender objects but he in heat of action
 is more vindicative than jealous love
 they call him troilus and on him erect
 a second hope as fairly built as hector
 thus says aeneas one that knows the youth
 even to his inches and with private soul
 did in great ilion thus translate him to me
 alarum hector and ajax fight
agamemnon they are in action
nestor now ajax hold thine own
troilus hector thou sleep'st
 awake thee
agamemnon his blows are well disposed there ajax
diomedes you must no more
 trumpets cease
aeneas princes enough so please you
ajax i am not warm yet let us fight again
diomedes as hector pleases
hector why then will i no more
 thou art great lord my father's sister's son
 a cousingerman to great priam's seed
 the obligation of our blood forbids
 a gory emulation twixt us twain
 were thy commixtion greek and trojan so
 that thou couldst say this hand is grecian all
 and this is trojan the sinews of this leg
 all greek and this all troy my mother's blood
 runs on the dexter cheek and this sinister
 bounds in my father's by jove multipotent
 thou shouldst not bear from me a greekish member
 wherein my sword had not impressure made
 of our rank feud but the just gods gainsay
 that any drop thou borrow'dst from thy mother
 my sacred aunt should by my mortal sword
 be drain'd let me embrace thee ajax
 by him that thunders thou hast lusty arms
 hector would have them fall upon him thus
 cousin all honour to thee
ajax i thank thee hector
 thou art too gentle and too free a man
 i came to kill thee cousin and bear hence
 a great addition earned in thy death
hector not neoptolemus so mirable
 on whose bright crest fame with her loud'st oyes
 cries this is he could promise to himself
 a thought of added honour torn from hector
aeneas there is expectance here from both the sides
 what further you will do
hector we'll answer it
 the issue is embracement ajax farewell
ajax if i might in entreaties find success
 as seld i have the chancei would desire
 my famous cousin to our grecian tents
diomedes tis agamemnon's wish and great achilles
 doth long to see unarm'd the valiant hector
hector aeneas call my brother troilus to me
 and signify this loving interview
 to the expecters of our trojan part
 desire them home give me thy hand my cousin
 i will go eat with thee and see your knights
ajax great agamemnon comes to meet us here
hector the worthiest of them tell me name by name
 but for achilles mine own searching eyes
 shall find him by his large and portly size
agamemnon worthy of arms as welcome as to one
 that would be rid of such an enemy
 but that's no welcome understand more clear
 what's past and what's to come is strew'd with husks
 and formless ruin of oblivion
 but in this extant moment faith and troth
 strain'd purely from all hollow biasdrawing
 bids thee with most divine integrity
 from heart of very heart great hector welcome
hector i thank thee most imperious agamemnon
agamemnon to troilus my wellfamed lord of troy no
 less to you
menelaus let me confirm my princely brother's greeting
 you brace of warlike brothers welcome hither
hector who must we answer
aeneas the noble menelaus
hector o you my lord by mars his gauntlet thanks
 mock not that i affect the untraded oath
 your quondam wife swears still by venus glove
 she's well but bade me not commend her to you
menelaus name her not now sir she's a deadly theme
hector o pardon i offend
nestor i have thou gallant trojan seen thee oft
 labouring for destiny make cruel way
 through ranks of greekish youth and i have seen thee
 as hot as perseus spur thy phrygian steed
 despising many forfeits and subduements
 when thou hast hung thy advanced sword i the air
 not letting it decline on the declined
 that i have said to some my standers by
 lo jupiter is yonder dealing life'
 and i have seen thee pause and take thy breath
 when that a ring of greeks have hemm'd thee in
 like an olympian wrestling this have i seen
 but this thy countenance still lock'd in steel
 i never saw till now i knew thy grandsire
 and once fought with him he was a soldier good
 but by great mars the captain of us all
 never saw like thee let an old man embrace thee
 and worthy warrior welcome to our tents
aeneas tis the old nestor
hector let me embrace thee good old chronicle
 that hast so long walk'd hand in hand with time
 most reverend nestor i am glad to clasp thee
nestor i would my arms could match thee in contention
 as they contend with thee in courtesy
hector i would they could
nestor ha
 by this white beard i'ld fight with thee tomorrow
 well welcome welcome i have seen the time
ulysses i wonder now how yonder city stands
 when we have here her base and pillar by us
hector i know your favour lord ulysses well
 ah sir there's many a greek and trojan dead
 since first i saw yourself and diomed
 in ilion on your greekish embassy
ulysses sir i foretold you then what would ensue
 my prophecy is but half his journey yet
 for yonder walls that pertly front your town
 yond towers whose wanton tops do buss the clouds
 must kiss their own feet
hector i must not believe you
 there they stand yet and modestly i think
 the fall of every phrygian stone will cost
 a drop of grecian blood the end crowns all
 and that old common arbitrator time
 will one day end it
ulysses so to him we leave it
 most gentle and most valiant hector welcome
 after the general i beseech you next
 to feast with me and see me at my tent
achilles i shall forestall thee lord ulysses thou
 now hector i have fed mine eyes on thee
 i have with exact view perused thee hector
 and quoted joint by joint
hector is this achilles
achilles i am achilles
hector stand fair i pray thee let me look on thee
achilles behold thy fill
hector nay i have done already
achilles thou art too brief i will the second time
 as i would buy thee view thee limb by limb
hector o like a book of sport thou'lt read me o'er
 but there's more in me than thou understand'st
 why dost thou so oppress me with thine eye
achilles tell me you heavens in which part of his body
 shall i destroy him whether there or there or there
 that i may give the local wound a name
 and make distinct the very breach whereout
 hector's great spirit flew answer me heavens
hector it would discredit the blest gods proud man
 to answer such a question stand again
 think'st thou to catch my life so pleasantly
 as to prenominate in nice conjecture
 where thou wilt hit me dead
achilles i tell thee yea
hector wert thou an oracle to tell me so
 i'd not believe thee henceforth guard thee well
 for i'll not kill thee there nor there nor there
 but by the forge that stithied mars his helm
 i'll kill thee every where yea o'er and o'er
 you wisest grecians pardon me this brag
 his insolence draws folly from my lips
 but i'll endeavour deeds to match these words
 or may i never
ajax do not chafe thee cousin
 and you achilles let these threats alone
 till accident or purpose bring you to't
 you may have every day enough of hector
 if you have stomach the general state i fear
