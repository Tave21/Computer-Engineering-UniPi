rosencrantz to what end my lord
hamlet that you must teach me but let me conjure you by
 the rights of our fellowship by the consonancy of
 our youth by the obligation of our everpreserved
 love and by what more dear a better proposer could
 charge you withal be even and direct with me
 whether you were sent for or no
rosencrantz aside to guildenstern what say you
hamlet aside nay then i have an eye of youif you
 love me hold not off
guildenstern my lord we were sent for
hamlet i will tell you why so shall my anticipation
 prevent your discovery and your secrecy to the king
 and queen moult no feather i have of latebut
 wherefore i know notlost all my mirth forgone all
 custom of exercises and indeed it goes so heavily
 with my disposition that this goodly frame the
 earth seems to me a sterile promontory this most
 excellent canopy the air look you this brave
 o'erhanging firmament this majestical roof fretted
 with golden fire why it appears no other thing to
 me than a foul and pestilent congregation of vapours
 what a piece of work is a man how noble in reason
 how infinite in faculty in form and moving how
 express and admirable in action how like an angel
 in apprehension how like a god the beauty of the
 world the paragon of animals and yet to me
 what is this quintessence of dust man delights not
 me no nor woman neither though by your smiling
 you seem to say so
rosencrantz my lord there was no such stuff in my thoughts
hamlet why did you laugh then when i said man delights not me'
rosencrantz to think my lord if you delight not in man what
 lenten entertainment the players shall receive from
 you we coted them on the way and hither are they
 coming to offer you service
hamlet he that plays the king shall be welcome his majesty
 shall have tribute of me the adventurous knight
 shall use his foil and target the lover shall not
 sigh gratis the humourous man shall end his part
 in peace the clown shall make those laugh whose
 lungs are tickled o the sere and the lady shall
 say her mind freely or the blank verse shall halt
 for't what players are they
rosencrantz even those you were wont to take delight in the
 tragedians of the city
hamlet how chances it they travel their residence both
 in reputation and profit was better both ways
rosencrantz i think their inhibition comes by the means of the
 late innovation
hamlet do they hold the same estimation they did when i was
 in the city are they so followed
rosencrantz no indeed are they not
hamlet how comes it do they grow rusty
rosencrantz nay their endeavour keeps in the wonted pace but
 there is sir an aery of children little eyases
 that cry out on the top of question and are most
 tyrannically clapped for't these are now the
 fashion and so berattle the common stagesso they
 call themthat many wearing rapiers are afraid of
 goosequills and dare scarce come thither
hamlet what are they children who maintains em how are
 they escoted will they pursue the quality no
 longer than they can sing will they not say
 afterwards if they should grow themselves to common
 playersas it is most like if their means are no
 bettertheir writers do them wrong to make them
 exclaim against their own succession
rosencrantz faith there has been much to do on both sides and
 the nation holds it no sin to tarre them to
 controversy there was for a while no money bid
 for argument unless the poet and the player went to
 cuffs in the question
hamlet is't possible
guildenstern o there has been much throwing about of brains
hamlet do the boys carry it away
rosencrantz ay that they do my lord hercules and his load too
hamlet it is not very strange for mine uncle is king of
 denmark and those that would make mows at him while
 my father lived give twenty forty fifty an
 hundred ducats apiece for his picture in little
 sblood there is something in this more than
 natural if philosophy could find it out
 flourish of trumpets within
guildenstern there are the players
hamlet gentlemen you are welcome to elsinore your hands
 come then the appurtenance of welcome is fashion
 and ceremony let me comply with you in this garb
 lest my extent to the players which i tell you
 must show fairly outward should more appear like
 entertainment than yours you are welcome but my
 unclefather and auntmother are deceived
guildenstern in what my dear lord
hamlet i am but mad northnorthwest when the wind is
 southerly i know a hawk from a handsaw
 enter polonius
lord polonius well be with you gentlemen
hamlet hark you guildenstern and you too at each ear a
 hearer that great baby you see there is not yet
 out of his swaddlingclouts
rosencrantz happily he's the second time come to them for they
 say an old man is twice a child
hamlet i will prophesy he comes to tell me of the players
 mark it you say right sir o monday morning
 twas so indeed
lord polonius my lord i have news to tell you
hamlet my lord i have news to tell you
 when roscius was an actor in rome
lord polonius the actors are come hither my lord
hamlet buz buz
lord polonius upon mine honour
hamlet then came each actor on his ass
lord polonius the best actors in the world either for tragedy
 comedy history pastoral pastoralcomical
 historicalpastoral tragicalhistorical tragical
 comicalhistoricalpastoral scene individable or
 poem unlimited seneca cannot be too heavy nor
 plautus too light for the law of writ and the
 liberty these are the only men
hamlet o jephthah judge of israel what a treasure hadst thou
lord polonius what a treasure had he my lord
hamlet why
 one fair daughter and no more
 the which he loved passing well'
lord polonius aside still on my daughter
hamlet am i not i the right old jephthah
lord polonius if you call me jephthah my lord i have a daughter
 that i love passing well
hamlet nay that follows not
lord polonius what follows then my lord
hamlet why
 as by lot god wot'
 and then you know
 it came to pass as most like it was'
 the first row of the pious chanson will show you
 more for look where my abridgement comes
 enter four or five players
 you are welcome masters welcome all i am glad
 to see thee well welcome good friends o my old
 friend thy face is valenced since i saw thee last
 comest thou to beard me in denmark what my young
 lady and mistress by'r lady your ladyship is
 nearer to heaven than when i saw you last by the
 altitude of a chopine pray god your voice like
 apiece of uncurrent gold be not cracked within the
 ring masters you are all welcome we'll e'en
 to't like french falconers fly at any thing we see
 we'll have a speech straight come give us a taste
 of your quality come a passionate speech
first player what speech my lord
hamlet i heard thee speak me a speech once but it was
 never acted or if it was not above once for the
 play i remember pleased not the million twas
 caviare to the general but it wasas i received
 it and others whose judgments in such matters
 cried in the top of minean excellent play well
 digested in the scenes set down with as much
 modesty as cunning i remember one said there
 were no sallets in the lines to make the matter
 savoury nor no matter in the phrase that might
 indict the author of affectation but called it an
 honest method as wholesome as sweet and by very
 much more handsome than fine one speech in it i
 chiefly loved twas aeneas tale to dido and
 thereabout of it especially where he speaks of
 priam's slaughter if it live in your memory begin
 at this line let me see let me see
 the rugged pyrrhus like the hyrcanian beast'
 it is not soit begins with pyrrhus
 the rugged pyrrhus he whose sable arms
 black as his purpose did the night resemble
 when he lay couched in the ominous horse
 hath now this dread and black complexion smear'd
 with heraldry more dismal head to foot
 now is he total gules horridly trick'd
 with blood of fathers mothers daughters sons
 baked and impasted with the parching streets
 that lend a tyrannous and damned light
 to their lord's murder roasted in wrath and fire
 and thus o'ersized with coagulate gore
 with eyes like carbuncles the hellish pyrrhus
 old grandsire priam seeks'
 so proceed you
lord polonius fore god my lord well spoken with good accent and
 good discretion
first player anon he finds him
 striking too short at greeks his antique sword
 rebellious to his arm lies where it falls
 repugnant to command unequal match'd
 pyrrhus at priam drives in rage strikes wide
 but with the whiff and wind of his fell sword
 the unnerved father falls then senseless ilium
 seeming to feel this blow with flaming top
 stoops to his base and with a hideous crash
 takes prisoner pyrrhus ear for lo his sword
 which was declining on the milky head
 of reverend priam seem'd i the air to stick
 so as a painted tyrant pyrrhus stood
 and like a neutral to his will and matter
 did nothing
