 and good plays prove the better by the help of good
 epilogues what a case am i in then that am
 neither a good epilogue nor cannot insinuate with
 you in the behalf of a good play i am not
 furnished like a beggar therefore to beg will not
 become me my way is to conjure you and i'll begin
 with the women i charge you o women for the love
 you bear to men to like as much of this play as
 please you and i charge you o men for the love
 you bear to womenas i perceive by your simpering
 none of you hates themthat between you and the
 women the play may please if i were a woman i
 would kiss as many of you as had beards that pleased
 me complexions that liked me and breaths that i
 defied not and i am sure as many as have good
 beards or good faces or sweet breaths will for my
 kind offer when i make curtsy bid me farewell

act i
scene i a hall in duke solinus's palace
 enter duke solinus aegeon gaoler officers and other
 attendants
aegeon proceed solinus to procure my fall
 and by the doom of death end woes and all
duke solinus merchant of syracuse plead no more
 i am not partial to infringe our laws
 the enmity and discord which of late
 sprung from the rancorous outrage of your duke
 to merchants our welldealing countrymen
 who wanting guilders to redeem their lives
 have seal'd his rigorous statutes with their bloods
 excludes all pity from our threatening looks
 for since the mortal and intestine jars
 twixt thy seditious countrymen and us
 it hath in solemn synods been decreed
 both by the syracusians and ourselves
 to admit no traffic to our adverse towns nay more
 if any born at ephesus be seen
 at any syracusian marts and fairs
 again if any syracusian born
 come to the bay of ephesus he dies
 his goods confiscate to the duke's dispose
 unless a thousand marks be levied
 to quit the penalty and to ransom him
 thy substance valued at the highest rate
 cannot amount unto a hundred marks
 therefore by law thou art condemned to die
aegeon yet this my comfort when your words are done
 my woes end likewise with the evening sun
duke solinus well syracusian say in brief the cause
 why thou departed'st from thy native home
 and for what cause thou camest to ephesus
aegeon a heavier task could not have been imposed
 than i to speak my griefs unspeakable
 yet that the world may witness that my end
 was wrought by nature not by vile offence
 i'll utter what my sorrows give me leave
 in syracusa was i born and wed
 unto a woman happy but for me
 and by me had not our hap been bad
 with her i lived in joy our wealth increased
 by prosperous voyages i often made
 to epidamnum till my factor's death
 and the great care of goods at random left
 drew me from kind embracements of my spouse
 from whom my absence was not six months old
 before herself almost at fainting under
 the pleasing punishment that women bear
 had made provision for her following me
 and soon and safe arrived where i was
 there had she not been long but she became
 a joyful mother of two goodly sons
 and which was strange the one so like the other
 as could not be distinguish'd but by names
 that very hour and in the selfsame inn
 a meaner woman was delivered
 of such a burden male twins both alike
 thosefor their parents were exceeding poor
 i bought and brought up to attend my sons
 my wife not meanly proud of two such boys
 made daily motions for our home return
 unwilling i agreed alas too soon
 we came aboard
 a league from epidamnum had we sail'd
 before the always windobeying deep
 gave any tragic instance of our harm
 but longer did we not retain much hope
 for what obscured light the heavens did grant
 did but convey unto our fearful minds
 a doubtful warrant of immediate death
 which though myself would gladly have embraced
 yet the incessant weepings of my wife
 weeping before for what she saw must come
 and piteous plainings of the pretty babes
 that mourn'd for fashion ignorant what to fear
 forced me to seek delays for them and me
 and this it was for other means was none
 the sailors sought for safety by our boat
 and left the ship then sinkingripe to us
 my wife more careful for the latterborn
 had fasten'd him unto a small spare mast
 such as seafaring men provide for storms
 to him one of the other twins was bound
 whilst i had been like heedful of the other
 the children thus disposed my wife and i
 fixing our eyes on whom our care was fix'd
 fasten'd ourselves at either end the mast
 and floating straight obedient to the stream
 was carried towards corinth as we thought
 at length the sun gazing upon the earth
 dispersed those vapours that offended us
 and by the benefit of his wished light
 the seas wax'd calm and we discovered
 two ships from far making amain to us
 of corinth that of epidaurus this
 but ere they cameo let me say no more
 gather the sequel by that went before
duke solinus nay forward old man do not break off so
 for we may pity though not pardon thee
aegeon o had the gods done so i had not now
 worthily term'd them merciless to us
 for ere the ships could meet by twice five leagues
 we were encounterd by a mighty rock
 which being violently borne upon
 our helpful ship was splitted in the midst
 so that in this unjust divorce of us
 fortune had left to both of us alike
 what to delight in what to sorrow for
 her part poor soul seeming as burdened
 with lesser weight but not with lesser woe
 was carried with more speed before the wind
 and in our sight they three were taken up
 by fishermen of corinth as we thought
 at length another ship had seized on us
 and knowing whom it was their hap to save
 gave healthful welcome to their shipwreck'd guests
 and would have reft the fishers of their prey
 had not their bark been very slow of sail
 and therefore homeward did they bend their course
 thus have you heard me sever'd from my bliss
 that by misfortunes was my life prolong'd
 to tell sad stories of my own mishaps
duke solinus and for the sake of them thou sorrowest for
 do me the favour to dilate at full
 what hath befall'n of them and thee till now
aegeon my youngest boy and yet my eldest care
 at eighteen years became inquisitive
 after his brother and importuned me
 that his attendantso his case was like
 reft of his brother but retain'd his name
 might bear him company in the quest of him
 whom whilst i labour'd of a love to see
 i hazarded the loss of whom i loved
 five summers have i spent in furthest greece
 roaming clean through the bounds of asia
 and coasting homeward came to ephesus
 hopeless to find yet loath to leave unsought
 or that or any place that harbours men
 but here must end the story of my life
 and happy were i in my timely death
 could all my travels warrant me they live
duke solinus hapless aegeon whom the fates have mark'd
 to bear the extremity of dire mishap
 now trust me were it not against our laws
 against my crown my oath my dignity
 which princes would they may not disannul
 my soul would sue as advocate for thee
 but though thou art adjudged to the death
 and passed sentence may not be recall'd
 but to our honour's great disparagement
 yet i will favour thee in what i can
 therefore merchant i'll limit thee this day
