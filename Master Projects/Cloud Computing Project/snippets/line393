 of whom i hope to make much benefit
 i crave your pardon soon at five o'clock
 please you i'll meet with you upon the mart
 and afterward consort you till bedtime
 my present business calls me from you now
antipholus
of syracuse farewell till then i will go lose myself
 and wander up and down to view the city
first merchant sir i commend you to your own content
 exit
antipholus
of syracuse he that commends me to mine own content
 commends me to the thing i cannot get
 i to the world am like a drop of water
 that in the ocean seeks another drop
 who falling there to find his fellow forth
 unseen inquisitive confounds himself
 so i to find a mother and a brother
 in quest of them unhappy lose myself
 enter dromio of ephesus
 here comes the almanac of my true date
 what now how chance thou art return'd so soon
dromio of ephesus return'd so soon rather approach'd too late
 the capon burns the pig falls from the spit
 the clock hath strucken twelve upon the bell
 my mistress made it one upon my cheek
 she is so hot because the meat is cold
 the meat is cold because you come not home
 you come not home because you have no stomach
 you have no stomach having broke your fast
 but we that know what tis to fast and pray
 are penitent for your default today
antipholus
of syracuse stop in your wind sir tell me this i pray
 where have you left the money that i gave you
dromio of ephesus osixpence that i had o wednesday last
 to pay the saddler for my mistress crupper
 the saddler had it sir i kept it not
antipholus
of syracuse i am not in a sportive humour now
 tell me and dally not where is the money
 we being strangers here how darest thou trust
 so great a charge from thine own custody
dromio of ephesus i pray you air as you sit at dinner
 i from my mistress come to you in post
 if i return i shall be post indeed
 for she will score your fault upon my pate
 methinks your maw like mine should be your clock
 and strike you home without a messenger
antipholus
of syracuse come dromio come these jests are out of season
 reserve them till a merrier hour than this
 where is the gold i gave in charge to thee
dromio of ephesus to me sir why you gave no gold to me
antipholus
of syracuse come on sir knave have done your foolishness
 and tell me how thou hast disposed thy charge
dromio of ephesus my charge was but to fetch you from the mart
 home to your house the phoenix sir to dinner
 my mistress and her sister stays for you

of syracuse in what safe place you have bestow'd my money
 or i shall break that merry sconce of yours
 that stands on tricks when i am undisposed

dromio of ephesus i have some marks of yours upon my pate
 some of my mistress marks upon my shoulders
 but not a thousand marks between you both
 if i should pay your worship those again
 perchance you will not bear them patiently
antipholus
of syracuse thy mistress marks what mistress slave hast thou

dromio of ephesus what mean you sir for god's sake hold your hands
 nay and you will not sir i'll take my heels
 exit
antipholus
of syracuse upon my life by some device or other
 the villain is o'erraught of all my money
 they say this town is full of cozenage
 as nimble jugglers that deceive the eye
 darkworking sorcerers that change the mind
 soulkilling witches that deform the body
 disguised cheaters prating mountebanks
 and many suchlike liberties of sin
 if it prove so i will be gone the sooner
 i'll to the centaur to go seek this slave
 i greatly fear my money is not safe
 exit
 the comedy of errors
act ii
scene i the house of antipholus of ephesus
 enter adriana and luciana
adriana neither my husband nor the slave return'd
 that in such haste i sent to seek his master
 sure luciana it is two o'clock
luciana perhaps some merchant hath invited him
 and from the mart he's somewhere gone to dinner
 good sister let us dine and never fret
 a man is master of his liberty
 time is their master and when they see time
 they'll go or come if so be patient sister
adriana why should their liberty than ours be more
luciana because their business still lies out o door
adriana look when i serve him so he takes it ill
luciana o know he is the bridle of your will
adriana there's none but asses will be bridled so
luciana why headstrong liberty is lash'd with woe
 there's nothing situate under heaven's eye
 but hath his bound in earth in sea in sky
 the beasts the fishes and the winged fowls
 are their males subjects and at their controls
 men more divine the masters of all these
 lords of the wide world and wild watery seas
 indued with intellectual sense and souls
 of more preeminence than fish and fowls
 are masters to their females and their lords
 then let your will attend on their accords
adriana this servitude makes you to keep unwed
luciana not this but troubles of the marriagebed
adriana but were you wedded you would bear some sway
luciana ere i learn love i'll practise to obey
adriana how if your husband start some other where
luciana till he come home again i would forbear
adriana patience unmoved no marvel though she pause
 they can be meek that have no other cause
 a wretched soul bruised with adversity
 we bid be quiet when we hear it cry
 but were we burdened with like weight of pain
 as much or more would we ourselves complain
 so thou that hast no unkind mate to grieve thee
 with urging helpless patience wouldst relieve me
 but if thou live to see like right bereft
 this foolbegg'd patience in thee will be left
luciana well i will marry one day but to try
 here comes your man now is your husband nigh
 enter dromio of ephesus
adriana say is your tardy master now at hand
dromio of ephesus nay he's at two hands with me and that my two ears
 can witness
adriana say didst thou speak with him know'st thou his mind
dromio of ephesus ay ay he told his mind upon mine ear
 beshrew his hand i scarce could understand it
luciana spake he so doubtfully thou couldst not feel his meaning
dromio of ephesus nay he struck so plainly i could too well feel his
 blows and withal so doubtfully that i could scarce
 understand them
adriana but say i prithee is he coming home it seems he
 hath great care to please his wife
dromio of ephesus why mistress sure my master is hornmad
adriana hornmad thou villain
dromio of ephesus i mean not cuckoldmad
 but sure he is stark mad
 when i desired him to come home to dinner
