for her sins have reached unto heaven and god hath remembered her iniquities
reward her even as she rewarded you and double unto her double according to her works in the cup which she hath filled fill to her double
how much she hath glorified herself and lived deliciously so much torment and sorrow give her for she saith in her heart i sit a queen and am no widow and shall see no sorrow
therefore shall her plagues come in one day death and mourning and famine and she shall be utterly burned with fire for strong is the lord god who judgeth her
and the kings of the earth who have committed fornication and lived deliciously with her shall bewail her and lament for her when they shall see the smoke of her burning
standing afar off for the fear of her torment saying alas alas that great city babylon that mighty city for in one hour is thy judgment come
and the merchants of the earth shall weep and mourn over her for no man buyeth their merchandise any more
the merchandise of gold and silver and precious stones and of pearls and fine linen and purple and silk and scarlet and all thyine wood and all manner vessels of ivory and all manner vessels of most precious wood and of brass and iron and marble
and cinnamon and odours and ointments and frankincense and wine and oil and fine flour and wheat and beasts and sheep and horses and chariots and slaves and souls of men
and the fruits that thy soul lusted after are departed from thee and all things which were dainty and goodly are departed from thee and thou shalt find them no more at all
the merchants of these things which were made rich by her shall stand afar off for the fear of her torment weeping and wailing
and saying alas alas that great city that was clothed in fine linen and purple and scarlet and decked with gold and precious stones and pearls
for in one hour so great riches is come to nought and every shipmaster and all the company in ships and sailors and as many as trade by sea stood afar off
and cried when they saw the smoke of her burning saying what city is like unto this great city
and they cast dust on their heads and cried weeping and wailing saying alas alas that great city wherein were made rich all that had ships in the sea by reason of her costliness for in one hour is she made desolate
rejoice over her thou heaven and ye holy apostles and prophets for god hath avenged you on her
and a mighty angel took up a stone like a great millstone and cast it into the sea saying thus with violence shall that great city babylon be thrown down and shall be found no more at all
and the voice of harpers and musicians and of pipers and trumpeters shall be heard no more at all in thee and no craftsman of whatsoever craft he be shall be found any more in thee and the sound of a millstone shall be heard no more at all in thee
and the light of a candle shall shine no more at all in thee and the voice of the bridegroom and of the bride shall be heard no more at all in thee for thy merchants were the great men of the earth for by thy sorceries were all nations deceived
and in her was found the blood of prophets and of saints and of all that were slain upon the earth
and after these things i heard a great voice of much people in heaven saying alleluia salvation and glory and honour and power unto the lord our god
for true and righteous are his judgments for he hath judged the great whore which did corrupt the earth with her fornication and hath avenged the blood of his servants at her hand
and again they said alleluia and her smoke rose up for ever and ever
and the four and twenty elders and the four beasts fell down and worshipped god that sat on the throne saying amen alleluia
and a voice came out of the throne saying praise our god all ye his servants and ye that fear him both small and great
and i heard as it were the voice of a great multitude and as the voice of many waters and as the voice of mighty thunderings saying alleluia for the lord god omnipotent reigneth
let us be glad and rejoice and give honour to him for the marriage of the lamb is come and his wife hath made herself ready
and to her was granted that she should be arrayed in fine linen clean and white for the fine linen is the righteousness of saints
and he saith unto me write blessed are they which are called unto the marriage supper of the lamb and he saith unto me these are the true sayings of god
and i fell at his feet to worship him and he said unto me see thou do it not i am thy fellowservant and of thy brethren that have the testimony of jesus worship god for the testimony of jesus is the spirit of prophecy
and i saw heaven opened and behold a white horse and he that sat upon him was called faithful and true and in righteousness he doth judge and make war
his eyes were as a flame of fire and on his head were many crowns and he had a name written that no man knew but he himself
and he was clothed with a vesture dipped in blood and his name is called the word of god
and the armies which were in heaven followed him upon white horses clothed in fine linen white and clean
and out of his mouth goeth a sharp sword that with it he should smite the nations and he shall rule them with a rod of iron and he treadeth the winepress of the fierceness and wrath of almighty god
and he hath on his vesture and on his thigh a name written king of kings and lord of lords
and i saw an angel standing in the sun and he cried with a loud voice saying to all the fowls that fly in the midst of heaven come and gather yourselves together unto the supper of the great god
that ye may eat the flesh of kings and the flesh of captains and the flesh of mighty men and the flesh of horses and of them that sit on them and the flesh of all men both free and bond both small and great
and i saw the beast and the kings of the earth and their armies gathered together to make war against him that sat on the horse and against his army
and the beast was taken and with him the false prophet that wrought miracles before him with which he deceived them that had received the mark of the beast and them that worshipped his image these both were cast alive into a lake of fire burning with brimstone
and the remnant were slain with the sword of him that sat upon the horse which sword proceeded out of his mouth and all the fowls were filled with their flesh
and i saw an angel come down from heaven having the key of the bottomless pit and a great chain in his hand
and he laid hold on the dragon that old serpent which is the devil and satan and bound him a thousand years
and cast him into the bottomless pit and shut him up and set a seal upon him that he should deceive the nations no more till the thousand years should be fulfilled and after that he must be loosed a little season
and i saw thrones and they sat upon them and judgment was given unto them and i saw the souls of them that were beheaded for the witness of jesus and for the word of god and which had not worshipped the beast neither his image neither had received his mark upon their foreheads or in their hands and they lived and reigned with christ a thousand years
but the rest of the dead lived not again until the thousand years were finished this is the first resurrection
blessed and holy is he that hath part in the first resurrection on such the second death hath no power but they shall be priests of god and of christ and shall reign with him a thousand years
and when the thousand years are expired satan shall be loosed out of his prison
and shall go out to deceive the nations which are in the four quarters of the earth gog and magog to gather them together to battle the number of whom is as the sand of the sea
and they went up on the breadth of the earth and compassed the camp of the saints about and the beloved city and fire came down from god out of heaven and devoured them
and the devil that deceived them was cast into the lake of fire and brimstone where the beast and the false prophet are and shall be tormented day and night for ever and ever
and i saw a great white throne and him that sat on it from whose face the earth and the heaven fled away and there was found no place for them
and i saw the dead small and great stand before god and the books were opened and another book was opened which is the book of life and the dead were judged out of those things which were written in the books according to their works
and the sea gave up the dead which were in it and death and hell delivered up the dead which were in them and they were judged every man according to their works
and death and hell were cast into the lake of fire this is the second death
and whosoever was not found written in the book of life was cast into the lake of fire
and i saw a new heaven and a new earth for the first heaven and the first earth were passed away and there was no more sea
and i john saw the holy city new jerusalem coming down from god out of heaven prepared as a bride adorned for her husband
and i heard a great voice out of heaven saying behold the tabernacle of god is with men and he will dwell with them and they shall be his people and god himself shall be with them and be their god
and god shall wipe away all tears from their eyes and there shall be no more death neither sorrow nor crying neither shall there be any more pain for the former things are passed away
and he that sat upon the throne said behold i make all things new and he said unto me write for these words are true and faithful
and he said unto me it is done i am alpha and omega the beginning and the end i will give unto him that is athirst of the fountain of the water of life freely
he that overcometh shall inherit all things and i will be his god and he shall be my son
but the fearful and unbelieving and the abominable and murderers and whoremongers and sorcerers and idolaters and all liars shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone which is the second death
and there came unto me one of the seven angels which had the seven vials full of the seven last plagues and talked with me saying come hither i will shew thee the bride the lamb's wife
and he carried me away in the spirit to a great and high mountain and shewed me that great city the holy jerusalem descending out of heaven from god
having the glory of god and her light was like unto a stone most precious even like a jasper stone clear as crystal
and had a wall great and high and had twelve gates and at the gates twelve angels and names written thereon which are the names of the twelve tribes of the children of israel
on the east three gates on the north three gates on the south three gates and on the west three gates
and the wall of the city had twelve foundations and in them the names of the twelve apostles of the lamb
and he that talked with me had a golden reed to measure the city and the gates thereof and the wall thereof
and the city lieth foursquare and the length is as large as the breadth and he measured the city with the reed twelve thousand furlongs the length and the breadth and the height of it are equal
and he measured the wall thereof an hundred and forty and four cubits according to the measure of a man that is of the angel
and the building of the wall of it was of jasper and the city was pure gold like unto clear glass
and the foundations of the wall of the city were garnished with all manner of precious stones the first foundation was jasper the second sapphire the third a chalcedony the fourth an emerald
the fifth sardonyx the sixth sardius the seventh chrysolyte the eighth beryl the ninth a topaz the tenth a chrysoprasus the eleventh a jacinth the twelfth an amethyst
and the twelve gates were twelve pearls every several gate was of one pearl and the street of the city was pure gold as it were transparent glass
and i saw no temple therein for the lord god almighty and the lamb are the temple of it
and the city had no need of the sun neither of the moon to shine in it for the glory of god did lighten it and the lamb is the light thereof
and the nations of them which are saved shall walk in the light of it and the kings of the earth do bring their glory and honour into it
and the gates of it shall not be shut at all by day for there shall be no night there
and they shall bring the glory and honour of the nations into it
and there shall in no wise enter into it any thing that defileth neither whatsoever worketh abomination or maketh a lie but they which are written in the lamb's book of life
and he shewed me a pure river of water of life clear as crystal proceeding out of the throne of god and of the lamb
in the midst of the street of it and on either side of the river was there the tree of life which bare twelve manner of fruits and yielded her fruit every month and the leaves of the tree were for the healing of the nations
and there shall be no more curse but the throne of god and of the lamb shall be in it and his servants shall serve him
and they shall see his face and his name shall be in their foreheads
and there shall be no night there and they need no candle neither light of the sun for the lord god giveth them light and they shall reign for ever and ever
and he said unto me these sayings are faithful and true and the lord god of the holy prophets sent his angel to shew unto his servants the things which must shortly be done
behold i come quickly blessed is he that keepeth the sayings of the prophecy of this book
and i john saw these things and heard them and when i had heard and seen i fell down to worship before the feet of the angel which shewed me these things
then saith he unto me see thou do it not for i am thy fellowservant and of thy brethren the prophets and of them which keep the sayings of this book worship god
and he saith unto me seal not the sayings of the prophecy of this book for the time is at hand
he that is unjust let him be unjust still and he which is filthy let him be filthy still and he that is righteous let him be righteous still and he that is holy let him be holy still
and behold i come quickly and my reward is with me to give every man according as his work shall be
i am alpha and omega the beginning and the end the first and the last
blessed are they that do his commandments that they may have right to the tree of life and may enter in through the gates into the city
for without are dogs and sorcerers and whoremongers and murderers and idolaters and whosoever loveth and maketh a lie
i jesus have sent mine angel to testify unto you these things in the churches i am the root and the offspring of david and the bright and morning star
and the spirit and the bride say come and let him that heareth say come and let him that is athirst come and whosoever will let him take the water of life freely
for i testify unto every man that heareth the words of the prophecy of this book if any man shall add unto these things god shall add unto him the plagues that are written in this book
and if any man shall take away from the words of the book of this prophecy god shall take away his part out of the book of life and out of the holy city and from the things which are written in this book
he which testifieth these things saith surely i come quickly amen even so come lord jesus
the grace of our lord jesus christ be with you all amen

philo nay but this dotage of our general's
 o'erflows the measure those his goodly eyes
 that o'er the files and musters of the war
 have glow'd like plated mars now bend now turn
 the office and devotion of their view
 upon a tawny front his captain's heart
 which in the scuffles of great fights hath burst
 the buckles on his breast reneges all temper
 and is become the bellows and the fan
 to cool a gipsy's lust
 flourish enter antony cleopatra her ladies
 the train with eunuchs fanning her
 look where they come
 take but good note and you shall see in him
 the triple pillar of the world transform'd
 into a strumpet's fool behold and see
cleopatra if it be love indeed tell me how much
mark antony there's beggary in the love that can be reckon'd
cleopatra i'll set a bourn how far to be beloved
