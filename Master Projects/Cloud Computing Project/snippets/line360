she says 'tis so they answer all 'tis so'
and would say after her if she said no'
lo here the gentle lark weary of rest
from his moist cabinet mounts up on high
and wakes the morning from whose silver breast
the sun ariseth in his majesty
who doth the world so gloriously behold
that cedartops and hills seem burnish'd gold
venus salutes him with this fair goodmorrow
'o thou clear god and patron of all light
from whom each lamp and shining star doth borrow
the beauteous influence that makes him bright
there lives a son that suck'd an earthly mother
may lend thee light as thou dost lend to other'
this said she hasteth to a myrtle grove
musing the morning is so much o'erworn
and yet she hears no tidings of her love
she hearkens for his hounds and for his horn
anon she hears them chant it lustily
and all in haste she coasteth to the cry
and as she runs the bushes in the way
some catch her by the neck some kiss her face
some twine about her thigh to make her stay
she wildly breaketh from their strict embrace
like a milch doe whose swelling dugs do ache
hasting to feed her fawn hid in some brake
by this she hears the hounds are at a bay
whereat she starts like one that spies an adder
wreathed up in fatal folds just in his way
the fear whereof doth make him shake and shudder
even so the timorous yelping of the hounds
appals her senses and her spirit confounds
for now she knows it is no gentle chase
but the blunt boar rough bear or lion proud
because the cry remaineth in one place
where fearfully the dogs exclaim aloud
finding their enemy to be so curst
they all strain courtesy who shall cope him first
this dismal cry rings sadly in her ear
through which it enters to surprise her heart
who overcome by doubt and bloodless fear
with coldpale weakness numbs each feeling part
like soldiers when their captain once doth yield
they basely fly and dare not stay the field
thus stands she in a trembling ecstasy
till cheering up her senses all dismay'd
she tells them tis a causeless fantasy
and childish error that they are afraid
bids them leave quaking bids them fear no more
and with that word she spied the hunted boar
whose frothy mouth bepainted all with red
like milk and blood being mingled both together
a second fear through all her sinews spread
which madly hurries her she knows not whither
this way runs and now she will no further
but back retires to rate the boar for murther
a thousand spleens bear her a thousand ways
she treads the path that she untreads again
her more than haste is mated with delays
like the proceedings of a drunken brain
full of respects yet nought at all respecting
in hand with all things nought at all effecting
here kennell'd in a brake she finds a hound
and asks the weary caitiff for his master
and there another licking of his wound
'gainst venom'd sores the only sovereign plaster
and here she meets another sadly scowling
to whom she speaks and he replies with howling
when he hath ceased his illresounding noise
another flapmouth'd mourner black and grim
against the welkin volleys out his voice
another and another answer him
clapping their proud tails to the ground below
shaking their scratch'd ears bleeding as they go
look how the world's poor people are amazed
at apparitions signs and prodigies
whereon with fearful eyes they long have gazed
infusing them with dreadful prophecies
so she at these sad signs draws up her breath
and sighing it again exclaims on death
'hardfavour'd tyrant ugly meagre lean
hateful divorce of love'thus chides she death
'grimgrinning ghost earth's worm what dost thou mean
to stifle beauty and to steal his breath
who when he lived his breath and beauty set
gloss on the rose smell to the violet
'if he be deado no it cannot be
seeing his beauty thou shouldst strike at it
o yes it may thou hast no eyes to see
but hatefully at random dost thou hit
thy mark is feeble age but thy false dart
mistakes that aim and cleaves an infant's heart
'hadst thou but bid beware then he had spoke
and hearing him thy power had lost his power
the destinies will curse thee for this stroke
they bid thee crop a weed thou pluck'st a flower
love's golden arrow at him should have fled
and not death's ebon dart to strike dead
'dost thou drink tears that thou provokest such weeping
what may a heavy groan advantage thee
why hast thou cast into eternal sleeping
those eyes that taught all other eyes to see
now nature cares not for thy mortal vigour
since her best work is ruin'd with thy rigour'
here overcome as one full of despair
she vail'd her eyelids who like sluices stopt
the crystal tide that from her two cheeks fair
in the sweet channel of her bosom dropt
but through the floodgates breaks the silver rain
and with his strong course opens them again
o how her eyes and tears did lend and borrow
her eyes seen in the tears tears in her eye
both crystals where they view'd each other's sorrow
sorrow that friendly sighs sought still to dry
but like a stormy day now wind now rain
sighs dry her cheeks tears make them wet again
variable passions throng her constant woe
as striving who should best become her grief
all entertain'd each passion labours so
that every present sorrow seemeth chief
but none is best then join they all together
like many clouds consulting for foul weather
by this far off she hears some huntsman hollo
a nurse's song ne'er pleased her babe so well
the dire imagination she did follow
this sound of hope doth labour to expel
for now reviving joy bids her rejoice
and flatters her it is adonis voice
whereat her tears began to turn their tide
being prison'd in her eye like pearls in glass
yet sometimes falls an orient drop beside
which her cheek melts as scorning it should pass
to wash the foul face of the sluttish ground
who is but drunken when she seemeth drown'd
o hardbelieving love how strange it seems
not to believe and yet too credulous
thy weal and woe are both of them extremes
despair and hope makes thee ridiculous
the one doth flatter thee in thoughts unlikely
in likely thoughts the other kills thee quickly
now she unweaves the web that she hath wrought
adonis lives and death is not to blame
it was not she that call'd him allto naught
now she adds honours to his hateful name
she clepes him king of graves and grave for kings
imperious supreme of all mortal things
'no no quoth she sweet death i did but jest
yet pardon me i felt a kind of fear
when as i met the boar that bloody beast
which knows no pity but is still severe
then gentle shadowtruth i must confess
i rail'd on thee fearing my love's decease
''tis not my fault the boar provoked my tongue
be wreak'd on him invisible commander
'tis he foul creature that hath done thee wrong
i did but act he's author of thy slander
grief hath two tongues and never woman yet
could rule them both without ten women's wit'
thus hoping that adonis is alive
her rash suspect she doth extenuate
and that his beauty may the better thrive
with death she humbly doth insinuate
tells him of trophies statues tombs and stories
his victories his triumphs and his glories
'o jove quoth she how much a fool was i
to be of such a weak and silly mind
to wail his death who lives and must not die
till mutual overthrow of mortal kind
for he being dead with him is beauty slain
and beauty dead black chaos comes again
'fie fie fond love thou art so full of fear
as one with treasure laden hemm'd thieves
trifles unwitnessed with eye or ear
thy coward heart with false bethinking grieves'
even at this word she hears a merry horn
whereat she leaps that was but late forlorn
as falcon to the lure away she flies
the grass stoops not she treads on it so light
and in her haste unfortunately spies
the foul boar's conquest on her fair delight
which seen her eyes as murder'd with the view
like stars ashamed of day themselves withdrew
or as the snail whose tender horns being hit
shrinks backward in his shelly cave with pain
and there all smother'd up in shade doth sit
long after fearing to creep forth again
so at his bloody view her eyes are fled
into the deep dark cabins of her head
where they resign their office and their light
to the disposing of her troubled brain
who bids them still consort with ugly night
and never wound the heart with looks again
who like a king perplexed in his throne
by their suggestion gives a deadly groan
whereat each tributary subject quakes
as when the wind imprison'd in the ground
struggling for passage earth's foundation shakes
which with cold terror doth men's minds confound
this mutiny each part doth so surprise
that from their dark beds once more leap her eyes
