bassanio and do you gratiano mean good faith
gratiano yes faith my lord
bassanio our feast shall be much honour'd in your marriage
gratiano we'll play with them the first boy for a thousand ducats
nerissa what and stake down
gratiano no we shall ne'er win at that sport and stake down
 but who comes here lorenzo and his infidel what
 and my old venetian friend salerio
 enter lorenzo jessica and salerio a messenger
 from venice
bassanio lorenzo and salerio welcome hither
 if that the youth of my new interest here
 have power to bid you welcome by your leave
 i bid my very friends and countrymen
 sweet portia welcome
portia so do i my lord
 they are entirely welcome
lorenzo i thank your honour for my part my lord
 my purpose was not to have seen you here
 but meeting with salerio by the way
 he did entreat me past all saying nay
 to come with him along
salerio i did my lord
 and i have reason for it signior antonio
 commends him to you
 gives bassanio a letter
bassanio ere i ope his letter
 i pray you tell me how my good friend doth
salerio not sick my lord unless it be in mind
 nor well unless in mind his letter there
 will show you his estate
gratiano nerissa cheer yon stranger bid her welcome
 your hand salerio what's the news from venice
 how doth that royal merchant good antonio
 i know he will be glad of our success
 we are the jasons we have won the fleece
salerio i would you had won the fleece that he hath lost
portia there are some shrewd contents in yon same paper
 that steals the colour from bassanio's cheek
 some dear friend dead else nothing in the world
 could turn so much the constitution
 of any constant man what worse and worse
 with leave bassanio i am half yourself
 and i must freely have the half of anything
 that this same paper brings you
bassanio o sweet portia
 here are a few of the unpleasant'st words
 that ever blotted paper gentle lady
 when i did first impart my love to you
 i freely told you all the wealth i had
 ran in my veins i was a gentleman
 and then i told you true and yet dear lady
 rating myself at nothing you shall see
 how much i was a braggart when i told you
 my state was nothing i should then have told you
 that i was worse than nothing for indeed
 i have engaged myself to a dear friend
 engaged my friend to his mere enemy
 to feed my means here is a letter lady
 the paper as the body of my friend
 and every word in it a gaping wound
 issuing lifeblood but is it true salerio
 have all his ventures fail'd what not one hit
 from tripolis from mexico and england
 from lisbon barbary and india
 and not one vessel scape the dreadful touch
 of merchantmarring rocks
salerio not one my lord
 besides it should appear that if he had
 the present money to discharge the jew
 he would not take it never did i know
 a creature that did bear the shape of man
 so keen and greedy to confound a man
 he plies the duke at morning and at night
 and doth impeach the freedom of the state
 if they deny him justice twenty merchants
 the duke himself and the magnificoes
 of greatest port have all persuaded with him
 but none can drive him from the envious plea
 of forfeiture of justice and his bond
jessica when i was with him i have heard him swear
 to tubal and to chus his countrymen
 that he would rather have antonio's flesh
 than twenty times the value of the sum
 that he did owe him and i know my lord
 if law authority and power deny not
 it will go hard with poor antonio
portia is it your dear friend that is thus in trouble
bassanio the dearest friend to me the kindest man
 the bestcondition'd and unwearied spirit
 in doing courtesies and one in whom
 the ancient roman honour more appears
 than any that draws breath in italy
portia what sum owes he the jew
bassanio for me three thousand ducats
portia what no more
 pay him six thousand and deface the bond
 double six thousand and then treble that
 before a friend of this description
 shall lose a hair through bassanio's fault
 first go with me to church and call me wife
 and then away to venice to your friend
 for never shall you lie by portia's side
 with an unquiet soul you shall have gold
 to pay the petty debt twenty times over
 when it is paid bring your true friend along
 my maid nerissa and myself meantime
 will live as maids and widows come away
 for you shall hence upon your weddingday
 bid your friends welcome show a merry cheer
 since you are dear bought i will love you dear
 but let me hear the letter of your friend
bassanio reads sweet bassanio my ships have all
 miscarried my creditors grow cruel my estate is
 very low my bond to the jew is forfeit and since
 in paying it it is impossible i should live all
 debts are cleared between you and i if i might but
 see you at my death notwithstanding use your
 pleasure if your love do not persuade you to come
 let not my letter
portia o love dispatch all business and be gone
bassanio since i have your good leave to go away
 i will make haste but till i come again
 no bed shall e'er be guilty of my stay
 no rest be interposer twixt us twain

scene iii venice a street
 enter shylock salarino antonio and gaoler
shylock gaoler look to him tell not me of mercy
 this is the fool that lent out money gratis
 gaoler look to him
antonio hear me yet good shylock
shylock i'll have my bond speak not against my bond
 i have sworn an oath that i will have my bond
 thou call'dst me dog before thou hadst a cause
 but since i am a dog beware my fangs
 the duke shall grant me justice i do wonder
 thou naughty gaoler that thou art so fond
 to come abroad with him at his request
antonio i pray thee hear me speak
shylock i'll have my bond i will not hear thee speak
 i'll have my bond and therefore speak no more
 i'll not be made a soft and dulleyed fool
 to shake the head relent and sigh and yield
 to christian intercessors follow not
 i'll have no speaking i will have my bond
 exit
salarino it is the most impenetrable cur
 that ever kept with men
antonio let him alone
 i'll follow him no more with bootless prayers
 he seeks my life his reason well i know
 i oft deliver'd from his forfeitures
 many that have at times made moan to me
 therefore he hates me
salarino i am sure the duke
 will never grant this forfeiture to hold
antonio the duke cannot deny the course of law
 for the commodity that strangers have
 with us in venice if it be denied
 will much impeach the justice of his state
 since that the trade and profit of the city
 consisteth of all nations therefore go
 these griefs and losses have so bated me
 that i shall hardly spare a pound of flesh
 tomorrow to my bloody creditor
 well gaoler on pray god bassanio come
 to see me pay his debt and then i care not

act iii
scene iv belmont a room in portia's house
 enter portia nerissa lorenzo jessica and
 balthasar
lorenzo madam although i speak it in your presence
 you have a noble and a true conceit
 of godlike amity which appears most strongly
 in bearing thus the absence of your lord
 but if you knew to whom you show this honour
 how true a gentleman you send relief
 how dear a lover of my lord your husband
 i know you would be prouder of the work
 than customary bounty can enforce you
portia i never did repent for doing good
 nor shall not now for in companions
 that do converse and waste the time together
 whose souls do bear an equal yoke of love
 there must be needs a like proportion
 of lineaments of manners and of spirit
 which makes me think that this antonio
 being the bosom lover of my lord
 must needs be like my lord if it be so
 how little is the cost i have bestow'd
 in purchasing the semblance of my soul
 from out the state of hellish misery
 this comes too near the praising of myself
 therefore no more of it hear other things
 lorenzo i commit into your hands
