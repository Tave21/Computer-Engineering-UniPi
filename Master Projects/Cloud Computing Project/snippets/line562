 my sequent protestation be thou true
 and i will see thee
cressida o you shall be exposed my lord to dangers
 as infinite as imminent but i'll be true
troilus and i'll grow friend with danger wear this sleeve
cressida and you this glove when shall i see you
troilus i will corrupt the grecian sentinels
 to give thee nightly visitation
 but yet be true
cressida o heavens be true again
troilus hear while i speak it love
 the grecian youths are full of quality
 they're loving well composed with gifts of nature
 flowing and swelling o'er with arts and exercise
 how novelty may move and parts with person
 alas a kind of godly jealousy
 which i beseech you call a virtuous sin
 makes me afeard
cressida o heavens you love me not
troilus die i a villain then
 in this i do not call your faith in question
 so mainly as my merit i cannot sing
 nor heel the high lavolt nor sweeten talk
 nor play at subtle games fair virtues all
 to which the grecians are most prompt and pregnant
 but i can tell that in each grace of these
 there lurks a still and dumbdiscoursive devil
 that tempts most cunningly but be not tempted
cressida do you think i will
troilus no
 but something may be done that we will not
 and sometimes we are devils to ourselves
 when we will tempt the frailty of our powers
 presuming on their changeful potency
aeneas within nay good my lord
troilus come kiss and let us part
paris within brother troilus
troilus good brother come you hither
 and bring aeneas and the grecian with you
cressida my lord will you be true
troilus who i alas it is my vice my fault
 whiles others fish with craft for great opinion
 i with great truth catch mere simplicity
 whilst some with cunning gild their copper crowns
 with truth and plainness i do wear mine bare
 fear not my truth the moral of my wit
 is plain and true there's all the reach of it
 enter aeneas paris antenor deiphobus
 and diomedes
 welcome sir diomed here is the lady
 which for antenor we deliver you
 at the port lord i'll give her to thy hand
 and by the way possess thee what she is
 entreat her fair and by my soul fair greek
 if e'er thou stand at mercy of my sword
 name cressida and thy life shall be as safe
 as priam is in ilion
diomedes fair lady cressid
 so please you save the thanks this prince expects
 the lustre in your eye heaven in your cheek
 pleads your fair usage and to diomed
 you shall be mistress and command him wholly
troilus grecian thou dost not use me courteously
 to shame the zeal of my petition to thee
 in praising her i tell thee lord of greece
 she is as far highsoaring o'er thy praises
 as thou unworthy to be call'd her servant
 i charge thee use her well even for my charge
 for by the dreadful pluto if thou dost not
 though the great bulk achilles be thy guard
 i'll cut thy throat
diomedes o be not moved prince troilus
 let me be privileged by my place and message
 to be a speaker free when i am hence
 i'll answer to my lust and know you lord
 i'll nothing do on charge to her own worth
 she shall be prized but that you say be't so'
 i'll speak it in my spirit and honour no'
troilus come to the port i'll tell thee diomed
 this brave shall oft make thee to hide thy head
 lady give me your hand and as we walk
 to our own selves bend we our needful talk
 exeunt troilus cressida and diomedes
 trumpet within
paris hark hector's trumpet
aeneas how have we spent this morning
 the prince must think me tardy and remiss
 that sore to ride before him to the field
paris tis troilus fault come come to field with him
deiphobus let us make ready straight
aeneas yea with a bridegroom's fresh alacrity
 let us address to tend on hector's heels
 the glory of our troy doth this day lie
 on his fair worth and single chivalry
 exeunt
 troilus and cressida
act iv
scene v the grecian camp lists set out
 enter ajax armed agamemnon achilles patroclus
 menelaus ulysses nestor and others
agamemnon here art thou in appointment fresh and fair
 anticipating time with starting courage
 give with thy trumpet a loud note to troy
 thou dreadful ajax that the appalled air
 may pierce the head of the great combatant
 and hale him hither
ajax thou trumpet there's my purse
 now crack thy lungs and split thy brazen pipe
 blow villain till thy sphered bias cheek
 outswell the colic of puff'd aquilon
 come stretch thy chest and let thy eyes spout blood
 thou blow'st for hector
 trumpet sounds
ulysses no trumpet answers
achilles tis but early days
agamemnon is not yond diomed with calchas daughter
ulysses tis he i ken the manner of his gait
 he rises on the toe that spirit of his
 in aspiration lifts him from the earth
 enter diomedes with cressida
agamemnon is this the lady cressid
diomedes even she
agamemnon most dearly welcome to the greeks sweet lady
nestor our general doth salute you with a kiss
ulysses yet is the kindness but particular
 twere better she were kiss'd in general
nestor and very courtly counsel i'll begin
 so much for nestor
achilles i'll take what winter from your lips fair lady
 achilles bids you welcome
menelaus i had good argument for kissing once
patroclus but that's no argument for kissing now
 for this popp'd paris in his hardiment
 and parted thus you and your argument
ulysses o deadly gall and theme of all our scorns
 for which we lose our heads to gild his horns
patroclus the first was menelaus kiss this mine
 patroclus kisses you
menelaus o this is trim
patroclus paris and i kiss evermore for him
menelaus i'll have my kiss sir lady by your leave
cressida in kissing do you render or receive
patroclus both take and give
cressida i'll make my match to live
 the kiss you take is better than you give
 therefore no kiss
menelaus i'll give you boot i'll give you three for one
cressida you're an odd man give even or give none
menelaus an odd man lady every man is odd
cressida no paris is not for you know tis true
 that you are odd and he is even with you
menelaus you fillip me o the head
cressida no i'll be sworn
ulysses it were no match your nail against his horn
 may i sweet lady beg a kiss of you
cressida you may
ulysses i do desire it
cressida why beg then
ulysses why then for venus sake give me a kiss
 when helen is a maid again and his
cressida i am your debtor claim it when tis due
ulysses never's my day and then a kiss of you
diomedes lady a word i'll bring you to your father
 exit with cressida
nestor a woman of quick sense
ulysses fie fie upon her
 there's language in her eye her cheek her lip
 nay her foot speaks her wanton spirits look out
 at every joint and motive of her body
 o these encounterers so glib of tongue
 that give accosting welcome ere it comes
 and wide unclasp the tables of their thoughts
 to every ticklish reader set them down
 for sluttish spoils of opportunity
 and daughters of the game
 trumpet within
all the trojans trumpet
agamemnon yonder comes the troop
 enter hector armed aeneas troilus and other
 trojans with attendants
aeneas hail all you state of greece what shall be done
 to him that victory commands or do you purpose
 a victor shall be known will you the knights
 shall to the edge of all extremity
 pursue each other or shall be divided
 by any voice or order of the field
 hector bade ask
agamemnon which way would hector have it
aeneas he cares not he'll obey conditions
achilles tis done like hector but securely done
 a little proudly and great deal misprizing
 the knight opposed
aeneas if not achilles sir
 what is your name
achilles if not achilles nothing
aeneas therefore achilles but whate'er know this
 in the extremity of great and little
 valour and pride excel themselves in hector
 the one almost as infinite as all
 the other blank as nothing weigh him well
