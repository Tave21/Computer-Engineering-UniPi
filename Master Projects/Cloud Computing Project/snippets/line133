for this cause the people also met him for that they heard that he had done this miracle
the pharisees therefore said among themselves perceive ye how ye prevail nothing behold the world is gone after him
and there were certain greeks among them that came up to worship at the feast
the same came therefore to philip which was of bethsaida of galilee and desired him saying sir we would see jesus
philip cometh and telleth andrew and again andrew and philip tell jesus
and jesus answered them saying the hour is come that the son of man should be glorified
verily verily i say unto you except a corn of wheat fall into the ground and die it abideth alone but if it die it bringeth forth much fruit
he that loveth his life shall lose it and he that hateth his life in this world shall keep it unto life eternal
if any man serve me let him follow me and where i am there shall also my servant be if any man serve me him will my father honour
now is my soul troubled and what shall i say father save me from this hour but for this cause came i unto this hour
father glorify thy name then came there a voice from heaven saying i have both glorified it and will glorify it again
the people therefore that stood by and heard it said that it thundered others said an angel spake to him
jesus answered and said this voice came not because of me but for your sakes
now is the judgment of this world now shall the prince of this world be cast out
and i if i be lifted up from the earth will draw all men unto me
this he said signifying what death he should die
the people answered him we have heard out of the law that christ abideth for ever and how sayest thou the son of man must be lifted up who is this son of man
then jesus said unto them yet a little while is the light with you walk while ye have the light lest darkness come upon you for he that walketh in darkness knoweth not whither he goeth
while ye have light believe in the light that ye may be the children of light these things spake jesus and departed and did hide himself from them
but though he had done so many miracles before them yet they believed not on him
that the saying of esaias the prophet might be fulfilled which he spake lord who hath believed our report and to whom hath the arm of the lord been revealed
therefore they could not believe because that esaias said again
he hath blinded their eyes and hardened their heart that they should not see with their eyes nor understand with their heart and be converted and i should heal them
these things said esaias when he saw his glory and spake of him
nevertheless among the chief rulers also many believed on him but because of the pharisees they did not confess him lest they should be put out of the synagogue
for they loved the praise of men more than the praise of god
jesus cried and said he that believeth on me believeth not on me but on him that sent me
and he that seeth me seeth him that sent me
i am come a light into the world that whosoever believeth on me should not abide in darkness
and if any man hear my words and believe not i judge him not for i came not to judge the world but to save the world
he that rejecteth me and receiveth not my words hath one that judgeth him the word that i have spoken the same shall judge him in the last day
for i have not spoken of myself but the father which sent me he gave me a commandment what i should say and what i should speak
and i know that his commandment is life everlasting whatsoever i speak therefore even as the father said unto me so i speak
now before the feast of the passover when jesus knew that his hour was come that he should depart out of this world unto the father having loved his own which were in the world he loved them unto the end
and supper being ended the devil having now put into the heart of judas iscariot simon's son to betray him
jesus knowing that the father had given all things into his hands and that he was come from god and went to god
he riseth from supper and laid aside his garments and took a towel and girded himself
after that he poureth water into a bason and began to wash the disciples feet and to wipe them with the towel wherewith he was girded
then cometh he to simon peter and peter saith unto him lord dost thou wash my feet
jesus answered and said unto him what i do thou knowest not now but thou shalt know hereafter
peter saith unto him thou shalt never wash my feet jesus answered him if i wash thee not thou hast no part with me
simon peter saith unto him lord not my feet only but also my hands and my head
jesus saith to him he that is washed needeth not save to wash his feet but is clean every whit and ye are clean but not all
for he knew who should betray him therefore said he ye are not all clean
so after he had washed their feet and had taken his garments and was set down again he said unto them know ye what i have done to you
ye call me master and lord and ye say well for so i am
if i then your lord and master have washed your feet ye also ought to wash one another's feet
for i have given you an example that ye should do as i have done to you
verily verily i say unto you the servant is not greater than his lord neither he that is sent greater than he that sent him
if ye know these things happy are ye if ye do them
i speak not of you all i know whom i have chosen but that the scripture may be fulfilled he that eateth bread with me hath lifted up his heel against me
now i tell you before it come that when it is come to pass ye may believe that i am he
verily verily i say unto you he that receiveth whomsoever i send receiveth me and he that receiveth me receiveth him that sent me
when jesus had thus said he was troubled in spirit and testified and said verily verily i say unto you that one of you shall betray me
then the disciples looked one on another doubting of whom he spake
now there was leaning on jesus bosom one of his disciples whom jesus loved
simon peter therefore beckoned to him that he should ask who it should be of whom he spake
he then lying on jesus breast saith unto him lord who is it
jesus answered he it is to whom i shall give a sop when i have dipped it and when he had dipped the sop he gave it to judas iscariot the son of simon
and after the sop satan entered into him then said jesus unto him that thou doest do quickly
now no man at the table knew for what intent he spake this unto him
for some of them thought because judas had the bag that jesus had said unto him buy those things that we have need of against the feast or that he should give something to the poor
he then having received the sop went immediately out and it was night
therefore when he was gone out jesus said now is the son of man glorified and god is glorified in him
if god be glorified in him god shall also glorify him in himself and shall straightway glorify him
little children yet a little while i am with you ye shall seek me and as i said unto the jews whither i go ye cannot come so now i say to you
a new commandment i give unto you that ye love one another as i have loved you that ye also love one another
by this shall all men know that ye are my disciples if ye have love one to another
simon peter said unto him lord whither goest thou jesus answered him whither i go thou canst not follow me now but thou shalt follow me afterwards
peter said unto him lord why cannot i follow thee now i will lay down my life for thy sake
jesus answered him wilt thou lay down thy life for my sake verily verily i say unto thee the cock shall not crow till thou hast denied me thrice
let not your heart be troubled ye believe in god believe also in me
in my father's house are many mansions if it were not so i would have told you i go to prepare a place for you
and if i go and prepare a place for you i will come again and receive you unto myself that where i am there ye may be also
and whither i go ye know and the way ye know
thomas saith unto him lord we know not whither thou goest and how can we know the way
jesus saith unto him i am the way the truth and the life no man cometh unto the father but by me
if ye had known me ye should have known my father also and from henceforth ye know him and have seen him
philip saith unto him lord shew us the father and it sufficeth us
jesus saith unto him have i been so long time with you and yet hast thou not known me philip he that hath seen me hath seen the father and how sayest thou then shew us the father
believest thou not that i am in the father and the father in me the words that i speak unto you i speak not of myself but the father that dwelleth in me he doeth the works
believe me that i am in the father and the father in me or else believe me for the very works sake
verily verily i say unto you he that believeth on me the works that i do shall he do also and greater works than these shall he do because i go unto my father
and whatsoever ye shall ask in my name that will i do that the father may be glorified in the son
if ye shall ask any thing in my name i will do it
if ye love me keep my commandments
and i will pray the father and he shall give you another comforter that he may abide with you for ever
even the spirit of truth whom the world cannot receive because it seeth him not neither knoweth him but ye know him for he dwelleth with you and shall be in you
i will not leave you comfortless i will come to you
yet a little while and the world seeth me no more but ye see me because i live ye shall live also
at that day ye shall know that i am in my father and ye in me and i in you
he that hath my commandments and keepeth them he it is that loveth me and he that loveth me shall be loved of my father and i will love him and will manifest myself to him
judas saith unto him not iscariot lord how is it that thou wilt manifest thyself unto us and not unto the world
jesus answered and said unto him if a man love me he will keep my words and my father will love him and we will come unto him and make our abode with him
he that loveth me not keepeth not my sayings and the word which ye hear is not mine but the father's which sent me
these things have i spoken unto you being yet present with you
but the comforter which is the holy ghost whom the father will send in my name he shall teach you all things and bring all things to your remembrance whatsoever i have said unto you
peace i leave with you my peace i give unto you not as the world giveth give i unto you let not your heart be troubled neither let it be afraid
ye have heard how i said unto you i go away and come again unto you if ye loved me ye would rejoice because i said i go unto the father for my father is greater than i
and now i have told you before it come to pass that when it is come to pass ye might believe
hereafter i will not talk much with you for the prince of this world cometh and hath nothing in me
but that the world may know that i love the father and as the father gave me commandment even so i do arise let us go hence
i am the true vine and my father is the husbandman
every branch in me that beareth not fruit he taketh away and every branch that beareth fruit he purgeth it that it may bring forth more fruit
now ye are clean through the word which i have spoken unto you
abide in me and i in you as the branch cannot bear fruit of itself except it abide in the vine no more can ye except ye abide in me
i am the vine ye are the branches he that abideth in me and i in him the same bringeth forth much fruit for without me ye can do nothing
if a man abide not in me he is cast forth as a branch and is withered and men gather them and cast them into the fire and they are burned
if ye abide in me and my words abide in you ye shall ask what ye will and it shall be done unto you
herein is my father glorified that ye bear much fruit so shall ye be my disciples
as the father hath loved me so have i loved you continue ye in my love
if ye keep my commandments ye shall abide in my love even as i have kept my father's commandments and abide in his love
these things have i spoken unto you that my joy might remain in you and that your joy might be full
this is my commandment that ye love one another as i have loved you
greater love hath no man than this that a man lay down his life for his friends
ye are my friends if ye do whatsoever i command you
henceforth i call you not servants for the servant knoweth not what his lord doeth but i have called you friends for all things that i have heard of my father i have made known unto you
ye have not chosen me but i have chosen you and ordained you that ye should go and bring forth fruit and that your fruit should remain that whatsoever ye shall ask of the father in my name he may give it you
these things i command you that ye love one another
if the world hate you ye know that it hated me before it hated you
if ye were of the world the world would love his own but because ye are not of the world but i have chosen you out of the world therefore the world hateth you
remember the word that i said unto you the servant is not greater than his lord if they have persecuted me they will also persecute you if they have kept my saying they will keep yours also
but all these things will they do unto you for my name's sake because they know not him that sent me
if i had not come and spoken unto them they had not had sin but now they have no cloak for their sin
he that hateth me hateth my father also
if i had not done among them the works which none other man did they had not had sin but now have they both seen and hated both me and my father
but this cometh to pass that the word might be fulfilled that is written in their law they hated me without a cause
but when the comforter is come whom i will send unto you from the father even the spirit of truth which proceedeth from the father he shall testify of me
and ye also shall bear witness because ye have been with me from the beginning
these things have i spoken unto you that ye should not be offended
they shall put you out of the synagogues yea the time cometh that whosoever killeth you will think that he doeth god service
and these things will they do unto you because they have not known the father nor me
but these things have i told you that when the time shall come ye may remember that i told you of them and these things i said not unto you at the beginning because i was with you
but now i go my way to him that sent me and none of you asketh me whither goest thou
but because i have said these things unto you sorrow hath filled your heart
nevertheless i tell you the truth it is expedient for you that i go away for if i go not away the comforter will not come unto you but if i depart i will send him unto you
and when he is come he will reprove the world of sin and of righteousness and of judgment
of sin because they believe not on me
of righteousness because i go to my father and ye see me no more
of judgment because the prince of this world is judged
i have yet many things to say unto you but ye cannot bear them now
howbeit when he the spirit of truth is come he will guide you into all truth for he shall not speak of himself but whatsoever he shall hear that shall he speak and he will shew you things to come
he shall glorify me for he shall receive of mine and shall shew it unto you
all things that the father hath are mine therefore said i that he shall take of mine and shall shew it unto you
a little while and ye shall not see me and again a little while and ye shall see me because i go to the father
then said some of his disciples among themselves what is this that he saith unto us a little while and ye shall not see me and again a little while and ye shall see me and because i go to the father
they said therefore what is this that he saith a little while we cannot tell what he saith
now jesus knew that they were desirous to ask him and said unto them do ye enquire among yourselves of that i said a little while and ye shall not see me and again a little while and ye shall see me
verily verily i say unto you that ye shall weep and lament but the world shall rejoice and ye shall be sorrowful but your sorrow shall be turned into joy
a woman when she is in travail hath sorrow because her hour is come but as soon as she is delivered of the child she remembereth no more the anguish for joy that a man is born into the world
and ye now therefore have sorrow but i will see you again and your heart shall rejoice and your joy no man taketh from you
and in that day ye shall ask me nothing verily verily i say unto you whatsoever ye shall ask the father in my name he will give it you
hitherto have ye asked nothing in my name ask and ye shall receive that your joy may be full
these things have i spoken unto you in proverbs but the time cometh when i shall no more speak unto you in proverbs but i shall shew you plainly of the father
at that day ye shall ask in my name and i say not unto you that i will pray the father for you
for the father himself loveth you because ye have loved me and have believed that i came out from god
i came forth from the father and am come into the world again i leave the world and go to the father
his disciples said unto him lo now speakest thou plainly and speakest no proverb
now are we sure that thou knowest all things and needest not that any man should ask thee by this we believe that thou camest forth from god
jesus answered them do ye now believe
behold the hour cometh yea is now come that ye shall be scattered every man to his own and shall leave me alone and yet i am not alone because the father is with me
these things i have spoken unto you that in me ye might have peace in the world ye shall have tribulation but be of good cheer i have overcome the world
these words spake jesus and lifted up his eyes to heaven and said father the hour is come glorify thy son that thy son also may glorify thee
as thou hast given him power over all flesh that he should give eternal life to as many as thou hast given him
and this is life eternal that they might know thee the only true god and jesus christ whom thou hast sent
i have glorified thee on the earth i have finished the work which thou gavest me to do
and now o father glorify thou me with thine own self with the glory which i had with thee before the world was
i have manifested thy name unto the men which thou gavest me out of the world thine they were and thou gavest them me and they have kept thy word
now they have known that all things whatsoever thou hast given me are of thee
for i have given unto them the words which thou gavest me and they have received them and have known surely that i came out from thee and they have believed that thou didst send me
i pray for them i pray not for the world but for them which thou hast given me for they are thine
and all mine are thine and thine are mine and i am glorified in them
and now i am no more in the world but these are in the world and i come to thee holy father keep through thine own name those whom thou hast given me that they may be one as we are
while i was with them in the world i kept them in thy name those that thou gavest me i have kept and none of them is lost but the son of perdition that the scripture might be fulfilled
and now come i to thee and these things i speak in the world that they might have my joy fulfilled in themselves
i have given them thy word and the world hath hated them because they are not of the world even as i am not of the world
i pray not that thou shouldest take them out of the world but that thou shouldest keep them from the evil
they are not of the world even as i am not of the world
sanctify them through thy truth thy word is truth
as thou hast sent me into the world even so have i also sent them into the world
and for their sakes i sanctify myself that they also might be sanctified through the truth
neither pray i for these alone but for them also which shall believe on me through their word
that they all may be one as thou father art in me and i in thee that they also may be one in us that the world may believe that thou hast sent me
and the glory which thou gavest me i have given them that they may be one even as we are one
i in them and thou in me that they may be made perfect in one and that the world may know that thou hast sent me and hast loved them as thou hast loved me
father i will that they also whom thou hast given me be with me where i am that they may behold my glory which thou hast given me for thou lovedst me before the foundation of the world
o righteous father the world hath not known thee but i have known thee and these have known that thou hast sent me
and i have declared unto them thy name and will declare it that the love wherewith thou hast loved me may be in them and i in them
when jesus had spoken these words he went forth with his disciples over the brook cedron where was a garden into the which he entered and his disciples
and judas also which betrayed him knew the place for jesus ofttimes resorted thither with his disciples
judas then having received a band of men and officers from the chief priests and pharisees cometh thither with lanterns and torches and weapons
jesus therefore knowing all things that should come upon him went forth and said unto them whom seek ye
they answered him jesus of nazareth jesus saith unto them i am he and judas also which betrayed him stood with them
as soon then as he had said unto them i am he they went backward and fell to the ground
then asked he them again whom seek ye and they said jesus of nazareth
jesus answered i have told you that i am he if therefore ye seek me let these go their way
that the saying might be fulfilled which he spake of them which thou gavest me have i lost none
then simon peter having a sword drew it and smote the high priest's servant and cut off his right ear the servant's name was malchus
then said jesus unto peter put up thy sword into the sheath the cup which my father hath given me shall i not drink it
then the band and the captain and officers of the jews took jesus and bound him
