 shall blow each dust each straw each little rub
 out of the path which shall directly lead
 thy foot to england's throne and therefore mark
 john hath seized arthur and it cannot be
 that whiles warm life plays in that infant's veins
 the misplaced john should entertain an hour
 one minute nay one quiet breath of rest
 a sceptre snatch'd with an unruly hand
 must be as boisterously maintain'd as gain'd
 and he that stands upon a slippery place
 makes nice of no vile hold to stay him up
 that john may stand then arthur needs must fall
 so be it for it cannot be but so
lewis but what shall i gain by young arthur's fall
cardinal pandulph you in the right of lady blanch your wife
 may then make all the claim that arthur did
lewis and lose it life and all as arthur did
cardinal pandulph how green you are and fresh in this old world
 john lays you plots the times conspire with you
 for he that steeps his safety in true blood
 shall find but bloody safety and untrue
 this act so evilly born shall cool the hearts
 of all his people and freeze up their zeal
 that none so small advantage shall step forth
 to cheque his reign but they will cherish it
 no natural exhalation in the sky
 no scope of nature no distemper'd day
 no common wind no customed event
 but they will pluck away his natural cause
 and call them meteors prodigies and signs
 abortives presages and tongues of heaven
 plainly denouncing vengeance upon john
lewis may be he will not touch young arthur's life
 but hold himself safe in his prisonment
cardinal pandulph o sir when he shall hear of your approach
 if that young arthur be not gone already
 even at that news he dies and then the hearts
 of all his people shall revolt from him
 and kiss the lips of unacquainted change
 and pick strong matter of revolt and wrath
 out of the bloody fingers ends of john
 methinks i see this hurly all on foot
 and o what better matter breeds for you
 than i have named the bastard faulconbridge
 is now in england ransacking the church
 offending charity if but a dozen french
 were there in arms they would be as a call
 to train ten thousand english to their side
 or as a little snow tumbled about
 anon becomes a mountain o noble dauphin
 go with me to the king tis wonderful
 what may be wrought out of their discontent
 now that their souls are topful of offence
 for england go i will whet on the king
lewis strong reasons make strong actions let us go
 if you say ay the king will not say no
 exeunt
 king john
act iv
scene i a room in a castle
 enter hubert and executioners
hubert heat me these irons hot and look thou stand
 within the arras when i strike my foot
 upon the bosom of the ground rush forth
 and bind the boy which you shall find with me
 fast to the chair be heedful hence and watch
first executioner i hope your warrant will bear out the deed
hubert uncleanly scruples fear not you look to't
 exeunt executioners
 young lad come forth i have to say with you
 enter arthur
arthur good morrow hubert
hubert good morrow little prince
arthur as little prince having so great a title
 to be more prince as may be you are sad
hubert indeed i have been merrier
arthur mercy on me
 methinks no body should be sad but i
 yet i remember when i was in france
 young gentlemen would be as sad as night
 only for wantonness by my christendom
 so i were out of prison and kept sheep
 i should be as merry as the day is long
 and so i would be here but that i doubt
 my uncle practises more harm to me
 he is afraid of me and i of him
 is it my fault that i was geffrey's son
 no indeed is't not and i would to heaven
 i were your son so you would love me hubert
hubert aside if i talk to him with his innocent prate
 he will awake my mercy which lies dead
 therefore i will be sudden and dispatch
arthur are you sick hubert you look pale today
 in sooth i would you were a little sick
 that i might sit all night and watch with you
 i warrant i love you more than you do me
hubert aside his words do take possession of my bosom
 read here young arthur
 showing a paper
 aside
 how now foolish rheum
 turning dispiteous torture out of door
 i must be brief lest resolution drop
 out at mine eyes in tender womanish tears
 can you not read it is it not fair writ
arthur too fairly hubert for so foul effect
 must you with hot irons burn out both mine eyes
hubert young boy i must
arthur and will you
hubert and i will
arthur have you the heart when your head did but ache
 i knit my handercher about your brows
 the best i had a princess wrought it me
 and i did never ask it you again
 and with my hand at midnight held your head
 and like the watchful minutes to the hour
 still and anon cheer'd up the heavy time
 saying what lack you and where lies your grief'
 or what good love may i perform for you'
 many a poor man's son would have lien still
 and ne'er have spoke a loving word to you
 but you at your sick service had a prince
 nay you may think my love was crafty love
 and call it cunning do an if you will
 if heaven be pleased that you must use me ill
 why then you must will you put out mine eyes
 these eyes that never did nor never shall
 so much as frown on you
hubert i have sworn to do it
 and with hot irons must i burn them out
arthur ah none but in this iron age would do it
 the iron of itself though heat redhot
 approaching near these eyes would drink my tears
 and quench his fiery indignation
 even in the matter of mine innocence
 nay after that consume away in rust
 but for containing fire to harm mine eye
 are you more stubbornhard than hammer'd iron
 an if an angel should have come to me
 and told me hubert should put out mine eyes
 i would not have believed himno tongue but hubert's
hubert come forth
 stamps
 reenter executioners with a cord irons &c
 do as i bid you do
arthur o save me hubert save me my eyes are out
 even with the fierce looks of these bloody men
hubert give me the iron i say and bind him here
arthur alas what need you be so boisterousrough
 i will not struggle i will stand stonestill
 for heaven sake hubert let me not be bound
 nay hear me hubert drive these men away
 and i will sit as quiet as a lamb
 i will not stir nor wince nor speak a word
 nor look upon the iron angerly
 thrust but these men away and i'll forgive you
 whatever torment you do put me to
hubert go stand within let me alone with him
first executioner i am best pleased to be from such a deed
 exeunt executioners
arthur alas i then have chid away my friend
 he hath a stern look but a gentle heart
 let him come back that his compassion may
 give life to yours
hubert come boy prepare yourself
arthur is there no remedy
hubert none but to lose your eyes
arthur o heaven that there were but a mote in yours
 a grain a dust a gnat a wandering hair
 any annoyance in that precious sense
 then feeling what small things are boisterous there
 your vile intent must needs seem horrible
hubert is this your promise go to hold your tongue
arthur hubert the utterance of a brace of tongues
 must needs want pleading for a pair of eyes
 let me not hold my tongue let me not hubert
 or hubert if you will cut out my tongue
 so i may keep mine eyes o spare mine eyes
 though to no use but still to look on you
 lo by my truth the instrument is cold
 and would not harm me
hubert i can heat it boy
arthur no in good sooth the fire is dead with grief
 being create for comfort to be used
 in undeserved extremes see else yourself
 there is no malice in this burning coal
 the breath of heaven has blown his spirit out
 and strew'd repentent ashes on his head
hubert but with my breath i can revive it boy
arthur an if you do you will but make it blush
 and glow with shame of your proceedings hubert
 nay it perchance will sparkle in your eyes
 and like a dog that is compell'd to fight
 snatch at his master that doth tarre him on
 all things that you should use to do me wrong
 deny their office only you do lack
 that mercy which fierce fire and iron extends
 creatures of note for mercylacking uses
hubert well see to live i will not touch thine eye
 for all the treasure that thine uncle owes
