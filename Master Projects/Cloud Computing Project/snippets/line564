 can scarce entreat you to be odd with him
hector i pray you let us see you in the field
 we have had pelting wars since you refused
 the grecians cause
achilles dost thou entreat me hector
 tomorrow do i meet thee fell as death
 tonight all friends
hector thy hand upon that match
agamemnon first all you peers of greece go to my tent
 there in the full convive we afterwards
 as hector's leisure and your bounties shall
 concur together severally entreat him
 beat loud the tabourines let the trumpets blow
 that this great soldier may his welcome know
 exeunt all except troilus and ulysses
troilus my lord ulysses tell me i beseech you
 in what place of the field doth calchas keep
ulysses at menelaus tent most princely troilus
 there diomed doth feast with him tonight
 who neither looks upon the heaven nor earth
 but gives all gaze and bent of amorous view
 on the fair cressid
troilus shall sweet lord be bound to you so much
 after we part from agamemnon's tent
 to bring me thither
ulysses you shall command me sir
 as gentle tell me of what honour was
 this cressida in troy had she no lover there
 that wails her absence
troilus o sir to such as boasting show their scars
 a mock is due will you walk on my lord
 she was beloved she loved she is and doth
 but still sweet love is food for fortune's tooth
 exeunt
 troilus and cressida
act v
scene i the grecian camp before achilles tent
 enter achilles and patroclus
achilles i'll heat his blood with greekish wine tonight
 which with my scimitar i'll cool tomorrow
 patroclus let us feast him to the height
patroclus here comes thersites
 enter thersites
achilles how now thou core of envy
 thou crusty batch of nature what's the news
thersites why thou picture of what thou seemest and idol
 of idiot worshippers here's a letter for thee
achilles from whence fragment
thersites why thou full dish of fool from troy
patroclus who keeps the tent now
thersites the surgeon's box or the patient's wound
patroclus well said adversity and what need these tricks
thersites prithee be silent boy i profit not by thy talk
 thou art thought to be achilles male varlet
patroclus male varlet you rogue what's that
thersites why his masculine whore now the rotten diseases
 of the south the gutsgriping ruptures catarrhs
 loads o gravel i the back lethargies cold
 palsies raw eyes dirtrotten livers wheezing
 lungs bladders full of imposthume sciaticas
 limekilns i the palm incurable boneache and the
 rivelled feesimple of the tetter take and take
 again such preposterous discoveries
patroclus why thou damnable box of envy thou what meanest
 thou to curse thus
thersites do i curse thee
patroclus why no you ruinous butt you whoreson
 indistinguishable cur no
thersites no why art thou then exasperate thou idle
 immaterial skein of sleavesilk thou green sarcenet
 flap for a sore eye thou tassel of a prodigal's
 purse thou ah how the poor world is pestered
 with such waterflies diminutives of nature
patroclus out gall
thersites finchegg
achilles my sweet patroclus i am thwarted quite
 from my great purpose in tomorrow's battle
 here is a letter from queen hecuba
 a token from her daughter my fair love
 both taxing me and gaging me to keep
 an oath that i have sworn i will not break it
 fall greeks fail fame honour or go or stay
 my major vow lies here this i'll obey
 come come thersites help to trim my tent
 this night in banqueting must all be spent
 away patroclus
 exeunt achilles and patroclus
thersites with too much blood and too little brain these two
 may run mad but if with too much brain and too
 little blood they do i'll be a curer of madmen
 here's agamemnon an honest fellow enough and one
 that loves quails but he has not so much brain as
 earwax and the goodly transformation of jupiter
 there his brother the bullthe primitive statue
 and oblique memorial of cuckolds a thrifty
 shoeinghorn in a chain hanging at his brother's
 legto what form but that he is should wit larded
 with malice and malice forced with wit turn him to
 to an ass were nothing he is both ass and ox to
 an ox were nothing he is both ox and ass to be a
 dog a mule a cat a fitchew a toad a lizard an
 owl a puttock or a herring without a roe i would
 not care but to be menelaus i would conspire
 against destiny ask me not what i would be if i
 were not thersites for i care not to be the louse
 of a lazar so i were not menelaus heyday
 spirits and fires
