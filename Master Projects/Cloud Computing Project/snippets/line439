 composition with the king of hungary why then all
 the dukes fall upon the king
first gentleman heaven grant us its peace but not the king of
 hungary's
second gentleman amen

 went to sea with the ten commandments but scraped
 one out of the table
second gentleman thou shalt not steal'
lucio ay that he razed
first gentleman why twas a commandment to command the captain and
 all the rest from their functions they put forth
 to steal there's not a soldier of us all that in

 grace was said
second gentleman no a dozen times at least
first gentleman what in metre
lucio in any proportion or in any language

 controversy as for example thou thyself art a
 wicked villain despite of all grace
first gentleman well there went but a pair of shears between us
lucio i grant as there may between the lists and the
 velvet thou art the list
first gentleman and thou the velvet thou art good velvet thou'rt
 a threepiled piece i warrant thee i had as lief
 be a list of an english kersey as be piled as thou
 art piled for a french velvet do i speak
 feelingly now
lucio i think thou dost and indeed with most painful
 feeling of thy speech i will out of thine own
 confession learn to begin thy health but whilst i
 live forget to drink after thee
first gentleman i think i have done myself wrong have i not
second gentleman yes that thou hast whether thou art tainted or free
lucio behold behold where madam mitigation comes i
 have purchased as many diseases under her roof as come to

first gentleman ay and more
lucio a french crown more
first gentleman thou art always figuring diseases in me but thou
 art full of error i am sound

 things that are hollow thy bones are hollow
 impiety has made a feast of thee

 three days his head to be chopped off
lucio but after all this fooling i would not have it so

mistress overdone i am too sure of it and it is for getting madam
 julietta with child
lucio believe me this may be he promised to meet me two
 hours since and he was ever precise in
 promisekeeping
second gentleman besides you know it draws something near to the
 speech we had to such a purpose
first gentleman but most of all agreeing with the proclamation

 exeunt lucio and gentlemen
mistress overdone thus what with the war what with the sweat what
 with the gallows and what with poverty i am
 customshrunk

mistress overdone what is there a maid with child by him
pompey no but there's a woman with maid by him you have
 not heard of the proclamation have you
mistress overdone what proclamation man
pompey all houses in the suburbs of vienna must be plucked down

 clients though you change your place you need not

mistress overdone what's to do here thomas tapster let's withdraw
pompey here comes signior claudio led by the provost to
 prison and there's madam juliet
 exeunt
 enter provost claudio juliet and officers
claudio fellow why dost thou show me thus to the world
 bear me to prison where i am committed
provost i do it not in evil disposition
 but from lord angelo by special charge
claudio thus can the demigod authority
 make us pay down for our offence by weight
 the words of heaven on whom it will it will
 on whom it will not so yet still tis just
 reenter lucio and two gentlemen
lucio why how now claudio whence comes this restraint
claudio from too much liberty my lucio liberty
 as surfeit is the father of much fast
 so every scope by the immoderate use
 turns to restraint our natures do pursue
 like rats that ravin down their proper bane
 a thirsty evil and when we drink we die
lucio if could speak so wisely under an arrest i would
 send for certain of my creditors and yet to say
 the truth i had as lief have the foppery of freedom
 as the morality of imprisonment what's thy
 offence claudio
claudio what but to speak of would offend again
lucio what is't murder
claudio no
lucio lechery
claudio call it so
provost away sir you must go
claudio one word good friend lucio a word with you
lucio a hundred if they'll do you any good
 is lechery so look'd after
claudio thus stands it with me upon a true contract
 i got possession of julietta's bed
 you know the lady she is fast my wife
 save that we do the denunciation lack
 of outward order this we came not to
 only for propagation of a dower
 remaining in the coffer of her friends
 from whom we thought it meet to hide our love
 till time had made them for us but it chances
 the stealth of our most mutual entertainment
 with character too gross is writ on juliet
lucio with child perhaps
claudio unhappily even so
 and the new deputy now for the duke
 whether it be the fault and glimpse of newness
 or whether that the body public be
 a horse whereon the governor doth ride
 who newly in the seat that it may know
 he can command lets it straight feel the spur
 whether the tyranny be in his place
 or in his emmence that fills it up
 i stagger inbut this new governor
 awakes me all the enrolled penalties
 which have like unscour'd armour hung by the wall
 so long that nineteen zodiacs have gone round
 and none of them been worn and for a name
 now puts the drowsy and neglected act
 freshly on me tis surely for a name
lucio i warrant it is and thy head stands so tickle on
 thy shoulders that a milkmaid if she be in love
 may sigh it off send after the duke and appeal to
 him
claudio i have done so but he's not to be found
 i prithee lucio do me this kind service
 this day my sister should the cloister enter
 and there receive her approbation
 acquaint her with the danger of my state
 implore her in my voice that she make friends
 to the strict deputy bid herself assay him
 i have great hope in that for in her youth
 there is a prone and speechless dialect
 such as move men beside she hath prosperous art
 when she will play with reason and discourse
 and well she can persuade
lucio i pray she may as well for the encouragement of the
 like which else would stand under grievous
 imposition as for the enjoying of thy life who i
 would be sorry should be thus foolishly lost at a
 game of ticktack i'll to her
claudio i thank you good friend lucio
lucio within two hours
claudio come officer away
 exeunt
 measure for measure

scene iii a monastery
 enter duke vincentio and friar thomas
duke vincentio no holy father throw away that thought
 believe not that the dribbling dart of love
 can pierce a complete bosom why i desire thee
 to give me secret harbour hath a purpose
