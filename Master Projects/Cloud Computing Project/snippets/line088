awake o north wind and come thou south blow upon my garden that the spices thereof may flow out let my beloved come into his garden and eat his pleasant fruits
i am come into my garden my sister my spouse i have gathered my myrrh with my spice i have eaten my honeycomb with my honey i have drunk my wine with my milk eat o friends drink yea drink abundantly o beloved
i sleep but my heart waketh it is the voice of my beloved that knocketh saying open to me my sister my love my dove my undefiled for my head is filled with dew and my locks with the drops of the night
i have put off my coat how shall i put it on i have washed my feet how shall i defile them
my beloved put in his hand by the hole of the door and my bowels were moved for him
i rose up to open to my beloved and my hands dropped with myrrh and my fingers with sweet smelling myrrh upon the handles of the lock
i opened to my beloved but my beloved had withdrawn himself and was gone my soul failed when he spake i sought him but i could not find him i called him but he gave me no answer
the watchmen that went about the city found me they smote me they wounded me the keepers of the walls took away my veil from me
i charge you o daughters of jerusalem if ye find my beloved that ye tell him that i am sick of love
what is thy beloved more than another beloved o thou fairest among women what is thy beloved more than another beloved that thou dost so charge us
my beloved is white and ruddy the chiefest among ten thousand
his head is as the most fine gold his locks are bushy and black as a raven
his eyes are as the eyes of doves by the rivers of waters washed with milk and fitly set
his cheeks are as a bed of spices as sweet flowers his lips like lilies dropping sweet smelling myrrh
his hands are as gold rings set with the beryl his belly is as bright ivory overlaid with sapphires
his legs are as pillars of marble set upon sockets of fine gold his countenance is as lebanon excellent as the cedars
his mouth is most sweet yea he is altogether lovely this is my beloved and this is my friend o daughters of jerusalem
whither is thy beloved gone o thou fairest among women whither is thy beloved turned aside that we may seek him with thee
my beloved is gone down into his garden to the beds of spices to feed in the gardens and to gather lilies
i am my beloved's and my beloved is mine he feedeth among the lilies
thou art beautiful o my love as tirzah comely as jerusalem terrible as an army with banners
turn away thine eyes from me for they have overcome me thy hair is as a flock of goats that appear from gilead
thy teeth are as a flock of sheep which go up from the washing whereof every one beareth twins and there is not one barren among them
as a piece of a pomegranate are thy temples within thy locks
there are threescore queens and fourscore concubines and virgins without number
my dove my undefiled is but one she is the only one of her mother she is the choice one of her that bare her the daughters saw her and blessed her yea the queens and the concubines and they praised her
who is she that looketh forth as the morning fair as the moon clear as the sun and terrible as an army with banners
i went down into the garden of nuts to see the fruits of the valley and to see whether the vine flourished and the pomegranates budded
or ever i was aware my soul made me like the chariots of amminadib
return return o shulamite return return that we may look upon thee what will ye see in the shulamite as it were the company of two armies
how beautiful are thy feet with shoes o prince's daughter the joints of thy thighs are like jewels the work of the hands of a cunning workman
thy navel is like a round goblet which wanteth not liquor thy belly is like an heap of wheat set about with lilies
thy two breasts are like two young roes that are twins
thy neck is as a tower of ivory thine eyes like the fishpools in heshbon by the gate of bathrabbim thy nose is as the tower of lebanon which looketh toward damascus
thine head upon thee is like carmel and the hair of thine head like purple the king is held in the galleries
how fair and how pleasant art thou o love for delights
this thy stature is like to a palm tree and thy breasts to clusters of grapes
i said i will go up to the palm tree i will take hold of the boughs thereof now also thy breasts shall be as clusters of the vine and the smell of thy nose like apples
and the roof of thy mouth like the best wine for my beloved that goeth down sweetly causing the lips of those that are asleep to speak
i am my beloved's and his desire is toward me
come my beloved let us go forth into the field let us lodge in the villages
let us get up early to the vineyards let us see if the vine flourish whether the tender grape appear and the pomegranates bud forth there will i give thee my loves
the mandrakes give a smell and at our gates are all manner of pleasant fruits new and old which i have laid up for thee o my beloved
o that thou wert as my brother that sucked the breasts of my mother when i should find thee without i would kiss thee yea i should not be despised
i would lead thee and bring thee into my mother's house who would instruct me i would cause thee to drink of spiced wine of the juice of my pomegranate
his left hand should be under my head and his right hand should embrace me
i charge you o daughters of jerusalem that ye stir not up nor awake my love until he please
who is this that cometh up from the wilderness leaning upon her beloved i raised thee up under the apple tree there thy mother brought thee forth there she brought thee forth that bare thee
set me as a seal upon thine heart as a seal upon thine arm for love is strong as death jealousy is cruel as the grave the coals thereof are coals of fire which hath a most vehement flame
many waters cannot quench love neither can the floods drown it if a man would give all the substance of his house for love it would utterly be contemned
we have a little sister and she hath no breasts what shall we do for our sister in the day when she shall be spoken for
if she be a wall we will build upon her a palace of silver and if she be a door we will inclose her with boards of cedar
i am a wall and my breasts like towers then was i in his eyes as one that found favour
solomon had a vineyard at baalhamon he let out the vineyard unto keepers every one for the fruit thereof was to bring a thousand pieces of silver
my vineyard which is mine is before me thou o solomon must have a thousand and those that keep the fruit thereof two hundred
thou that dwellest in the gardens the companions hearken to thy voice cause me to hear it
make haste my beloved and be thou like to a roe or to a young hart upon the mountains of spices
the vision of isaiah the son of amoz which he saw concerning judah and jerusalem in the days of uzziah jotham ahaz and hezekiah kings of judah
hear o heavens and give ear o earth for the lord hath spoken i have nourished and brought up children and they have rebelled against me
the ox knoweth his owner and the ass his master's crib but israel doth not know my people doth not consider
ah sinful nation a people laden with iniquity a seed of evildoers children that are corrupters they have forsaken the lord they have provoked the holy one of israel unto anger they are gone away backward
why should ye be stricken any more ye will revolt more and more the whole head is sick and the whole heart faint
from the sole of the foot even unto the head there is no soundness in it but wounds and bruises and putrifying sores they have not been closed neither bound up neither mollified with ointment
your country is desolate your cities are burned with fire your land strangers devour it in your presence and it is desolate as overthrown by strangers
and the daughter of zion is left as a cottage in a vineyard as a lodge in a garden of cucumbers as a besieged city
except the lord of hosts had left unto us a very small remnant we should have been as sodom and we should have been like unto gomorrah
hear the word of the lord ye rulers of sodom give ear unto the law of our god ye people of gomorrah
to what purpose is the multitude of your sacrifices unto me saith the lord i am full of the burnt offerings of rams and the fat of fed beasts and i delight not in the blood of bullocks or of lambs or of he goats
when ye come to appear before me who hath required this at your hand to tread my courts
bring no more vain oblations incense is an abomination unto me the new moons and sabbaths the calling of assemblies i cannot away with it is iniquity even the solemn meeting
your new moons and your appointed feasts my soul hateth they are a trouble unto me i am weary to bear them
and when ye spread forth your hands i will hide mine eyes from you yea when ye make many prayers i will not hear your hands are full of blood
wash you make you clean put away the evil of your doings from before mine eyes cease to do evil
learn to do well seek judgment relieve the oppressed judge the fatherless plead for the widow
come now and let us reason together saith the lord though your sins be as scarlet they shall be as white as snow though they be red like crimson they shall be as wool
if ye be willing and obedient ye shall eat the good of the land
but if ye refuse and rebel ye shall be devoured with the sword for the mouth of the lord hath spoken it
how is the faithful city become an harlot it was full of judgment righteousness lodged in it but now murderers
thy silver is become dross thy wine mixed with water
thy princes are rebellious and companions of thieves every one loveth gifts and followeth after rewards they judge not the fatherless neither doth the cause of the widow come unto them
therefore saith the lord the lord of hosts the mighty one of israel ah i will ease me of mine adversaries and avenge me of mine enemies
and i will turn my hand upon thee and purely purge away thy dross and take away all thy tin
and i will restore thy judges as at the first and thy counsellors as at the beginning afterward thou shalt be called the city of righteousness the faithful city
zion shall be redeemed with judgment and her converts with righteousness
and the destruction of the transgressors and of the sinners shall be together and they that forsake the lord shall be consumed
for they shall be ashamed of the oaks which ye have desired and ye shall be confounded for the gardens that ye have chosen
for ye shall be as an oak whose leaf fadeth and as a garden that hath no water
and the strong shall be as tow and the maker of it as a spark and they shall both burn together and none shall quench them
the word that isaiah the son of amoz saw concerning judah and jerusalem
and it shall come to pass in the last days that the mountain of the lord's house shall be established in the top of the mountains and shall be exalted above the hills and all nations shall flow unto it
and many people shall go and say come ye and let us go up to the mountain of the lord to the house of the god of jacob and he will teach us of his ways and we will walk in his paths for out of zion shall go forth the law and the word of the lord from jerusalem
and he shall judge among the nations and shall rebuke many people and they shall beat their swords into plowshares and their spears into pruninghooks nation shall not lift up sword against nation neither shall they learn war any more
o house of jacob come ye and let us walk in the light of the lord
therefore thou hast forsaken thy people the house of jacob because they be replenished from the east and are soothsayers like the philistines and they please themselves in the children of strangers
their land also is full of silver and gold neither is there any end of their treasures their land is also full of horses neither is there any end of their chariots
their land also is full of idols they worship the work of their own hands that which their own fingers have made
and the mean man boweth down and the great man humbleth himself therefore forgive them not
enter into the rock and hide thee in the dust for fear of the lord and for the glory of his majesty
the lofty looks of man shall be humbled and the haughtiness of men shall be bowed down and the lord alone shall be exalted in that day
for the day of the lord of hosts shall be upon every one that is proud and lofty and upon every one that is lifted up and he shall be brought low
and upon all the cedars of lebanon that are high and lifted up and upon all the oaks of bashan
and upon all the high mountains and upon all the hills that are lifted up
and upon every high tower and upon every fenced wall
and upon all the ships of tarshish and upon all pleasant pictures
and the loftiness of man shall be bowed down and the haughtiness of men shall be made low and the lord alone shall be exalted in that day
and the idols he shall utterly abolish
and they shall go into the holes of the rocks and into the caves of the earth for fear of the lord and for the glory of his majesty when he ariseth to shake terribly the earth
in that day a man shall cast his idols of silver and his idols of gold which they made each one for himself to worship to the moles and to the bats
to go into the clefts of the rocks and into the tops of the ragged rocks for fear of the lord and for the glory of his majesty when he ariseth to shake terribly the earth
cease ye from man whose breath is in his nostrils for wherein is he to be accounted of 
for behold the lord the lord of hosts doth take away from jerusalem and from judah the stay and the staff the whole stay of bread and the whole stay of water
the mighty man and the man of war the judge and the prophet and the prudent and the ancient
the captain of fifty and the honourable man and the counsellor and the cunning artificer and the eloquent orator
and i will give children to be their princes and babes shall rule over them
and the people shall be oppressed every one by another and every one by his neighbour the child shall behave himself proudly against the ancient and the base against the honourable
when a man shall take hold of his brother of the house of his father saying thou hast clothing be thou our ruler and let this ruin be under thy hand
in that day shall he swear saying i will not be an healer for in my house is neither bread nor clothing make me not a ruler of the people
for jerusalem is ruined and judah is fallen because their tongue and their doings are against the lord to provoke the eyes of his glory
the shew of their countenance doth witness against them and they declare their sin as sodom they hide it not woe unto their soul for they have rewarded evil unto themselves
say ye to the righteous that it shall be well with him for they shall eat the fruit of their doings
woe unto the wicked it shall be ill with him for the reward of his hands shall be given him
as for my people children are their oppressors and women rule over them o my people they which lead thee cause thee to err and destroy the way of thy paths
the lord standeth up to plead and standeth to judge the people
the lord will enter into judgment with the ancients of his people and the princes thereof for ye have eaten up the vineyard the spoil of the poor is in your houses
what mean ye that ye beat my people to pieces and grind the faces of the poor saith the lord god of hosts
moreover the lord saith because the daughters of zion are haughty and walk with stretched forth necks and wanton eyes walking and mincing as they go and making a tinkling with their feet
therefore the lord will smite with a scab the crown of the head of the daughters of zion and the lord will discover their secret parts
in that day the lord will take away the bravery of their tinkling ornaments about their feet and their cauls and their round tires like the moon
the chains and the bracelets and the mufflers
the bonnets and the ornaments of the legs and the headbands and the tablets and the earrings
the rings and nose jewels
the changeable suits of apparel and the mantles and the wimples and the crisping pins
the glasses and the fine linen and the hoods and the vails
and it shall come to pass that instead of sweet smell there shall be stink and instead of a girdle a rent and instead of well set hair baldness and instead of a stomacher a girding of sackcloth and burning instead of beauty
thy men shall fall by the sword and thy mighty in the war
and her gates shall lament and mourn and she being desolate shall sit upon the ground
and in that day seven women shall take hold of one man saying we will eat our own bread and wear our own apparel only let us be called by thy name to take away our reproach
in that day shall the branch of the lord be beautiful and glorious and the fruit of the earth shall be excellent and comely for them that are escaped of israel
and it shall come to pass that he that is left in zion and he that remaineth in jerusalem shall be called holy even every one that is written among the living in jerusalem
when the lord shall have washed away the filth of the daughters of zion and shall have purged the blood of jerusalem from the midst thereof by the spirit of judgment and by the spirit of burning
and the lord will create upon every dwelling place of mount zion and upon her assemblies a cloud and smoke by day and the shining of a flaming fire by night for upon all the glory shall be a defence
and there shall be a tabernacle for a shadow in the day time from the heat and for a place of refuge and for a covert from storm and from rain
now will i sing to my wellbeloved a song of my beloved touching his vineyard my wellbeloved hath a vineyard in a very fruitful hill
and he fenced it and gathered out the stones thereof and planted it with the choicest vine and built a tower in the midst of it and also made a winepress therein and he looked that it should bring forth grapes and it brought forth wild grapes
and now o inhabitants of jerusalem and men of judah judge i pray you betwixt me and my vineyard
what could have been done more to my vineyard that i have not done in it wherefore when i looked that it should bring forth grapes brought it forth wild grapes
and now go to i will tell you what i will do to my vineyard i will take away the hedge thereof and it shall be eaten up and break down the wall thereof and it shall be trodden down
and i will lay it waste it shall not be pruned nor digged but there shall come up briers and thorns i will also command the clouds that they rain no rain upon it
for the vineyard of the lord of hosts is the house of israel and the men of judah his pleasant plant and he looked for judgment but behold oppression for righteousness but behold a cry
woe unto them that join house to house that lay field to field till there be no place that they may be placed alone in the midst of the earth
in mine ears said the lord of hosts of a truth many houses shall be desolate even great and fair without inhabitant
yea ten acres of vineyard shall yield one bath and the seed of an homer shall yield an ephah
woe unto them that rise up early in the morning that they may follow strong drink that continue until night till wine inflame them
and the harp and the viol the tabret and pipe and wine are in their feasts but they regard not the work of the lord neither consider the operation of his hands
therefore my people are gone into captivity because they have no knowledge and their honourable men are famished and their multitude dried up with thirst
therefore hell hath enlarged herself and opened her mouth without measure and their glory and their multitude and their pomp and he that rejoiceth shall descend into it
and the mean man shall be brought down and the mighty man shall be humbled and the eyes of the lofty shall be humbled
but the lord of hosts shall be exalted in judgment and god that is holy shall be sanctified in righteousness
then shall the lambs feed after their manner and the waste places of the fat ones shall strangers eat
woe unto them that draw iniquity with cords of vanity and sin as it were with a cart rope
that say let him make speed and hasten his work that we may see it and let the counsel of the holy one of israel draw nigh and come that we may know it
woe unto them that call evil good and good evil that put darkness for light and light for darkness that put bitter for sweet and sweet for bitter
woe unto them that are wise in their own eyes and prudent in their own sight
woe unto them that are mighty to drink wine and men of strength to mingle strong drink
which justify the wicked for reward and take away the righteousness of the righteous from him
therefore as the fire devoureth the stubble and the flame consumeth the chaff so their root shall be as rottenness and their blossom shall go up as dust because they have cast away the law of the lord of hosts and despised the word of the holy one of israel
therefore is the anger of the lord kindled against his people and he hath stretched forth his hand against them and hath smitten them and the hills did tremble and their carcases were torn in the midst of the streets for all this his anger is not turned away but his hand is stretched out still
and he will lift up an ensign to the nations from far and will hiss unto them from the end of the earth and behold they shall come with speed swiftly
none shall be weary nor stumble among them none shall slumber nor sleep neither shall the girdle of their loins be loosed nor the latchet of their shoes be broken
whose arrows are sharp and all their bows bent their horses hoofs shall be counted like flint and their wheels like a whirlwind
their roaring shall be like a lion they shall roar like young lions yea they shall roar and lay hold of the prey and shall carry it away safe and none shall deliver it
and in that day they shall roar against them like the roaring of the sea and if one look unto the land behold darkness and sorrow and the light is darkened in the heavens thereof
in the year that king uzziah died i saw also the lord sitting upon a throne high and lifted up and his train filled the temple
above it stood the seraphims each one had six wings with twain he covered his face and with twain he covered his feet and with twain he did fly
and one cried unto another and said holy holy holy is the lord of hosts the whole earth is full of his glory
and the posts of the door moved at the voice of him that cried and the house was filled with smoke
then said i woe is me for i am undone because i am a man of unclean lips and i dwell in the midst of a people of unclean lips for mine eyes have seen the king the lord of hosts
then flew one of the seraphims unto me having a live coal in his hand which he had taken with the tongs from off the altar
and he laid it upon my mouth and said lo this hath touched thy lips and thine iniquity is taken away and thy sin purged
also i heard the voice of the lord saying whom shall i send and who will go for us then said i here am i send me
and he said go and tell this people hear ye indeed but understand not and see ye indeed but perceive not
make the heart of this people fat and make their ears heavy and shut their eyes lest they see with their eyes and hear with their ears and understand with their heart and convert and be healed
then said i lord how long and he answered until the cities be wasted without inhabitant and the houses without man and the land be utterly desolate
and the lord have removed men far away and there be a great forsaking in the midst of the land
but yet in it shall be a tenth and it shall return and shall be eaten as a teil tree and as an oak whose substance is in them when they cast their leaves so the holy seed shall be the substance thereof
and it came to pass in the days of ahaz the son of jotham the son of uzziah king of judah that rezin the king of syria and pekah the son of remaliah king of israel went up toward jerusalem to war against it but could not prevail against it
and it was told the house of david saying syria is confederate with ephraim and his heart was moved and the heart of his people as the trees of the wood are moved with the wind
then said the lord unto isaiah go forth now to meet ahaz thou and shearjashub thy son at the end of the conduit of the upper pool in the highway of the fuller's field
and say unto him take heed and be quiet fear not neither be fainthearted for the two tails of these smoking firebrands for the fierce anger of rezin with syria and of the son of remaliah
because syria ephraim and the son of remaliah have taken evil counsel against thee saying
let us go up against judah and vex it and let us make a breach therein for us and set a king in the midst of it even the son of tabeal
thus saith the lord god it shall not stand neither shall it come to pass
for the head of syria is damascus and the head of damascus is rezin and within threescore and five years shall ephraim be broken that it be not a people
and the head of ephraim is samaria and the head of samaria is remaliah's son if ye will not believe surely ye shall not be established
moreover the lord spake again unto ahaz saying
ask thee a sign of the lord thy god ask it either in the depth or in the height above
but ahaz said i will not ask neither will i tempt the lord
and he said hear ye now o house of david is it a small thing for you to weary men but will ye weary my god also
therefore the lord himself shall give you a sign behold a virgin shall conceive and bear a son and shall call his name immanuel
butter and honey shall he eat that he may know to refuse the evil and choose the good
