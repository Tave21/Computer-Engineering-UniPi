1cor24 and my speech and my preaching was not with enticing words of man's wisdom but in demonstration of the spirit and of power
1cor25 that your faith should not stand in the wisdom of men but in the power of god
1cor26 howbeit we speak wisdom among them that are perfect yet not the wisdom of this world nor of the princes of this world that come to nought
1cor27 but we speak the wisdom of god in a mystery even the hidden wisdom which god ordained before the world unto our glory
1cor28 which none of the princes of this world knew for had they known it they would not have crucified the lord of glory
1cor29 but as it is written eye hath not seen nor ear heard neither have entered into the heart of man the things which god hath prepared for them that love him
1cor210 but god hath revealed them unto us by his spirit for the spirit searcheth all things yea the deep things of god
1cor211 for what man knoweth the things of a man save the spirit of man which is in him even so the things of god knoweth no man but the spirit of god
1cor212 now we have received not the spirit of the world but the spirit which is of god that we might know the things that are freely given to us of god
1cor213 which things also we speak not in the words which man's wisdom teacheth but which the holy ghost teacheth comparing spiritual things with spiritual
1cor214 but the natural man receiveth not the things of the spirit of god for they are foolishness unto him neither can he know them because they are spiritually discerned
1cor215 but he that is spiritual judgeth all things yet he himself is judged of no man
1cor216 for who hath known the mind of the lord that he may instruct him but we have the mind of christ
1cor31 and i brethren could not speak unto you as unto spiritual but as unto carnal even as unto babes in christ
1cor32 i have fed you with milk and not with meat for hitherto ye were not able to bear it neither yet now are ye able
1cor33 for ye are yet carnal for whereas there is among you envying and strife and divisions are ye not carnal and walk as men
1cor34 for while one saith i am of paul and another i am of apollos are ye not carnal
1cor35 who then is paul and who is apollos but ministers by whom ye believed even as the lord gave to every man
1cor36 i have planted apollos watered but god gave the increase
1cor37 so then neither is he that planteth any thing neither he that watereth but god that giveth the increase
1cor38 now he that planteth and he that watereth are one and every man shall receive his own reward according to his own labour
1cor39 for we are labourers together with god ye are god's husbandry ye are god's building
1cor310 according to the grace of god which is given unto me as a wise masterbuilder i have laid the foundation and another buildeth thereon but let every man take heed how he buildeth thereupon
1cor311 for other foundation can no man lay than that is laid which is jesus christ
1cor312 now if any man build upon this foundation gold silver precious stones wood hay stubble
1cor313 every man's work shall be made manifest for the day shall declare it because it shall be revealed by fire and the fire shall try every man's work of what sort it is
1cor314 if any man's work abide which he hath built thereupon he shall receive a reward
1cor315 if any man's work shall be burned he shall suffer loss but he himself shall be saved yet so as by fire
1cor316 know ye not that ye are the temple of god and that the spirit of god dwelleth in you
1cor317 if any man defile the temple of god him shall god destroy for the temple of god is holy which temple ye are
1cor318 let no man deceive himself if any man among you seemeth to be wise in this world let him become a fool that he may be wise
1cor319 for the wisdom of this world is foolishness with god for it is written he taketh the wise in their own craftiness
1cor320 and again the lord knoweth the thoughts of the wise that they are vain
1cor321 therefore let no man glory in men for all things are yours
1cor322 whether paul or apollos or cephas or the world or life or death or things present or things to come all are yours
1cor323 and ye are christ's and christ is god's
1cor41 let a man so account of us as of the ministers of christ and stewards of the mysteries of god
1cor42 moreover it is required in stewards that a man be found faithful
1cor43 but with me it is a very small thing that i should be judged of you or of man's judgment yea i judge not mine own self
1cor44 for i know nothing by myself yet am i not hereby justified but he that judgeth me is the lord
1cor45 therefore judge nothing before the time until the lord come who both will bring to light the hidden things of darkness and will make manifest the counsels of the hearts and then shall every man have praise of god
1cor46 and these things brethren i have in a figure transferred to myself and to apollos for your sakes that ye might learn in us not to think of men above that which is written that no one of you be puffed up for one against another
1cor47 for who maketh thee to differ from another and what hast thou that thou didst not receive now if thou didst receive it why dost thou glory as if thou hadst not received it
1cor48 now ye are full now ye are rich ye have reigned as kings without us and i would to god ye did reign that we also might reign with you
1cor49 for i think that god hath set forth us the apostles last as it were appointed to death for we are made a spectacle unto the world and to angels and to men
1cor410 we are fools for christ's sake but ye are wise in christ we are weak but ye are strong ye are honourable but we are despised
1cor411 even unto this present hour we both hunger and thirst and are naked and are buffeted and have no certain dwellingplace
1cor412 and labour working with our own hands being reviled we bless being persecuted we suffer it
1cor413 being defamed we intreat we are made as the filth of the world and are the offscouring of all things unto this day
1cor414 i write not these things to shame you but as my beloved sons i warn you
1cor415 for though ye have ten thousand instructors in christ yet have ye not many fathers for in christ jesus i have begotten you through the gospel
1cor416 wherefore i beseech you be ye followers of me
1cor417 for this cause have i sent unto you timotheus who is my beloved son and faithful in the lord who shall bring you into remembrance of my ways which be in christ as i teach every where in every church
1cor418 now some are puffed up as though i would not come to you
1cor419 but i will come to you shortly if the lord will and will know not the speech of them which are puffed up but the power
1cor420 for the kingdom of god is not in word but in power
1cor421 what will ye shall i come unto you with a rod or in love and in the spirit of meekness
1cor51 it is reported commonly that there is fornication among you and such fornication as is not so much as named among the gentiles that one should have his father's wife
1cor52 and ye are puffed up and have not rather mourned that he that hath done this deed might be taken away from among you
1cor53 for i verily as absent in body but present in spirit have judged already as though i were present concerning him that hath so done this deed
1cor54 in the name of our lord jesus christ when ye are gathered together and my spirit with the power of our lord jesus christ
1cor55 to deliver such an one unto satan for the destruction of the flesh that the spirit may be saved in the day of the lord jesus
1cor56 your glorying is not good know ye not that a little leaven leaveneth the whole lump
1cor57 purge out therefore the old leaven that ye may be a new lump as ye are unleavened for even christ our passover is sacrificed for us
1cor58 therefore let us keep the feast not with old leaven neither with the leaven of malice and wickedness but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth
1cor59 i wrote unto you in an epistle not to company with fornicators
1cor510 yet not altogether with the fornicators of this world or with the covetous or extortioners or with idolaters for then must ye needs go out of the world
1cor511 but now i have written unto you not to keep company if any man that is called a brother be a fornicator or covetous or an idolater or a railer or a drunkard or an extortioner with such an one no not to eat
1cor512 for what have i to do to judge them also that are without do not ye judge them that are within
1cor513 but them that are without god judgeth therefore put away from among yourselves that wicked person
1cor61 dare any of you having a matter against another go to law before the unjust and not before the saints
1cor62 do ye not know that the saints shall judge the world and if the world shall be judged by you are ye unworthy to judge the smallest matters
1cor63 know ye not that we shall judge angels how much more things that pertain to this life
1cor64 if then ye have judgments of things pertaining to this life set them to judge who are least esteemed in the church
1cor65 i speak to your shame is it so that there is not a wise man among you no not one that shall be able to judge between his brethren
1cor66 but brother goeth to law with brother and that before the unbelievers
1cor67 now therefore there is utterly a fault among you because ye go to law one with another why do ye not rather take wrong why do ye not rather suffer yourselves to be defrauded
1cor68 nay ye do wrong and defraud and that your brethren
1cor69 know ye not that the unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of god be not deceived neither fornicators nor idolaters nor adulterers nor effeminate nor abusers of themselves with mankind
1cor610 nor thieves nor covetous nor drunkards nor revilers nor extortioners shall inherit the kingdom of god
1cor611 and such were some of you but ye are washed but ye are sanctified but ye are justified in the name of the lord jesus and by the spirit of our god
1cor612 all things are lawful unto me but all things are not expedient all things are lawful for me but i will not be brought under the power of any
1cor613 meats for the belly and the belly for meats but god shall destroy both it and them now the body is not for fornication but for the lord and the lord for the body
1cor614 and god hath both raised up the lord and will also raise up us by his own power
1cor615 know ye not that your bodies are the members of christ shall i then take the members of christ and make them the members of an harlot god forbid
1cor616 what know ye not that he which is joined to an harlot is one body for two saith he shall be one flesh
1cor617 but he that is joined unto the lord is one spirit
1cor618 flee fornication every sin that a man doeth is without the body but he that committeth fornication sinneth against his own body
1cor619 what know ye not that your body is the temple of the holy ghost which is in you which ye have of god and ye are not your own
1cor620 for ye are bought with a price therefore glorify god in your body and in your spirit which are god's
1cor71 now concerning the things whereof ye wrote unto me it is good for a man not to touch a woman
1cor72 nevertheless to avoid fornication let every man have his own wife and let every woman have her own husband
1cor73 let the husband render unto the wife due benevolence and likewise also the wife unto the husband
1cor74 the wife hath not power of her own body but the husband and likewise also the husband hath not power of his own body but the wife
1cor75 defraud ye not one the other except it be with consent for a time that ye may give yourselves to fasting and prayer and come together again that satan tempt you not for your incontinency
1cor76 but i speak this by permission and not of commandment
1cor77 for i would that all men were even as i myself but every man hath his proper gift of god one after this manner and another after that
1cor78 i say therefore to the unmarried and widows it is good for them if they abide even as i
1cor79 but if they cannot contain let them marry for it is better to marry than to burn
1cor710 and unto the married i command yet not i but the lord let not the wife depart from her husband
1cor711 but and if she depart let her remain unmarried or be reconciled to her husband and let not the husband put away his wife
1cor712 but to the rest speak i not the lord if any brother hath a wife that believeth not and she be pleased to dwell with him let him not put her away
1cor713 and the woman which hath an husband that believeth not and if he be pleased to dwell with her let her not leave him
1cor714 for the unbelieving husband is sanctified by the wife and the unbelieving wife is sanctified by the husband else were your children unclean but now are they holy
1cor715 but if the unbelieving depart let him depart a brother or a sister is not under bondage in such cases but god hath called us to peace
1cor716 for what knowest thou o wife whether thou shalt save thy husband or how knowest thou o man whether thou shalt save thy wife
1cor717 but as god hath distributed to every man as the lord hath called every one so let him walk and so ordain i in all churches
1cor718 is any man called being circumcised let him not become uncircumcised is any called in uncircumcision let him not be circumcised
1cor719 circumcision is nothing and uncircumcision is nothing but the keeping of the commandments of god
1cor720 let every man abide in the same calling wherein he was called
1cor721 art thou called being a servant care not for it but if thou mayest be made free use it rather
1cor722 for he that is called in the lord being a servant is the lord's freeman likewise also he that is called being free is christ's servant
1cor723 ye are bought with a price be not ye the servants of men
1cor724 brethren let every man wherein he is called therein abide with god
1cor725 now concerning virgins i have no commandment of the lord yet i give my judgment as one that hath obtained mercy of the lord to be faithful
1cor726 i suppose therefore that this is good for the present distress i say that it is good for a man so to be
1cor727 art thou bound unto a wife seek not to be loosed art thou loosed from a wife seek not a wife
1cor728 but and if thou marry thou hast not sinned and if a virgin marry she hath not sinned nevertheless such shall have trouble in the flesh but i spare you
1cor729 but this i say brethren the time is short it remaineth that both they that have wives be as though they had none
1cor730 and they that weep as though they wept not and they that rejoice as though they rejoiced not and they that buy as though they possessed not
1cor731 and they that use this world as not abusing it for the fashion of this world passeth away
1cor732 but i would have you without carefulness he that is unmarried careth for the things that belong to the lord how he may please the lord
1cor733 but he that is married careth for the things that are of the world how he may please his wife
1cor734 there is difference also between a wife and a virgin the unmarried woman careth for the things of the lord that she may be holy both in body and in spirit but she that is married careth for the things of the world how she may please her husband
1cor735 and this i speak for your own profit not that i may cast a snare upon you but for that which is comely and that ye may attend upon the lord without distraction
1cor736 but if any man think that he behaveth himself uncomely toward his virgin if she pass the flower of her age and need so require let him do what he will he sinneth not let them marry
1cor737 nevertheless he that standeth stedfast in his heart having no necessity but hath power over his own will and hath so decreed in his heart that he will keep his virgin doeth well
1cor738 so then he that giveth her in marriage doeth well but he that giveth her not in marriage doeth better
1cor739 the wife is bound by the law as long as her husband liveth but if her husband be dead she is at liberty to be married to whom she will only in the lord
1cor740 but she is happier if she so abide after my judgment and i think also that i have the spirit of god
1cor81 now as touching things offered unto idols we know that we all have knowledge knowledge puffeth up but charity edifieth
1cor82 and if any man think that he knoweth any thing he knoweth nothing yet as he ought to know
1cor83 but if any man love god the same is known of him
1cor84 as concerning therefore the eating of those things that are offered in sacrifice unto idols we know that an idol is nothing in the world and that there is none other god but one
1cor85 for though there be that are called gods whether in heaven or in earth as there be gods many and lords many
1cor86 but to us there is but one god the father of whom are all things and we in him and one lord jesus christ by whom are all things and we by him
1cor87 howbeit there is not in every man that knowledge for some with conscience of the idol unto this hour eat it as a thing offered unto an idol and their conscience being weak is defiled
1cor88 but meat commendeth us not to god for neither if we eat are we the better neither if we eat not are we the worse
1cor89 but take heed lest by any means this liberty of yours become a stumblingblock to them that are weak
1cor810 for if any man see thee which hast knowledge sit at meat in the idol's temple shall not the conscience of him which is weak be emboldened to eat those things which are offered to idols
1cor811 and through thy knowledge shall the weak brother perish for whom christ died
1cor812 but when ye sin so against the brethren and wound their weak conscience ye sin against christ
1cor813 wherefore if meat make my brother to offend i will eat no flesh while the world standeth lest i make my brother to offend
1cor91 am i not an apostle am i not free have i not seen jesus christ our lord are not ye my work in the lord
1cor92 if i be not an apostle unto others yet doubtless i am to you for the seal of mine apostleship are ye in the lord
1cor93 mine answer to them that do examine me is this
1cor94 have we not power to eat and to drink
1cor95 have we not power to lead about a sister a wife as well as other apostles and as the brethren of the lord and cephas
1cor96 or i only and barnabas have not we power to forbear working
1cor97 who goeth a warfare any time at his own charges who planteth a vineyard and eateth not of the fruit thereof or who feedeth a flock and eateth not of the milk of the flock
1cor98 say i these things as a man or saith not the law the same also
1cor99 for it is written in the law of moses thou shalt not muzzle the mouth of the ox that treadeth out the corn doth god take care for oxen
1cor910 or saith he it altogether for our sakes for our sakes no doubt this is written that he that ploweth should plow in hope and that he that thresheth in hope should be partaker of his hope
1cor911 if we have sown unto you spiritual things is it a great thing if we shall reap your carnal things
1cor912 if others be partakers of this power over you are not we rather nevertheless we have not used this power but suffer all things lest we should hinder the gospel of christ
1cor913 do ye not know that they which minister about holy things live of the things of the temple and they which wait at the altar are partakers with the altar
1cor914 even so hath the lord ordained that they which preach the gospel should live of the gospel
1cor915 but i have used none of these things neither have i written these things that it should be so done unto me for it were better for me to die than that any man should make my glorying void
1cor916 for though i preach the gospel i have nothing to glory of for necessity is laid upon me yea woe is unto me if i preach not the gospel
1cor917 for if i do this thing willingly i have a reward but if against my will a dispensation of the gospel is committed unto me
1cor918 what is my reward then verily that when i preach the gospel i may make the gospel of christ without charge that i abuse not my power in the gospel
1cor919 for though i be free from all men yet have i made myself servant unto all that i might gain the more
1cor920 and unto the jews i became as a jew that i might gain the jews to them that are under the law as under the law that i might gain them that are under the law
1cor921 to them that are without law as without law being not without law to god but under the law to christ that i might gain them that are without law
1cor922 to the weak became i as weak that i might gain the weak i am made all things to all men that i might by all means save some
1cor923 and this i do for the gospel's sake that i might be partaker thereof with you
1cor924 know ye not that they which run in a race run all but one receiveth the prize so run that ye may obtain
1cor925 and every man that striveth for the mastery is temperate in all things now they do it to obtain a corruptible crown but we an incorruptible
1cor926 i therefore so run not as uncertainly so fight i not as one that beateth the air
1cor927 but i keep under my body and bring it into subjection lest that by any means when i have preached to others i myself should be a castaway
1cor101 moreover brethren i would not that ye should be ignorant how that all our fathers were under the cloud and all passed through the sea
1cor102 and were all baptized unto moses in the cloud and in the sea
1cor103 and did all eat the same spiritual meat
1cor104 and did all drink the same spiritual drink for they drank of that spiritual rock that followed them and that rock was christ
1cor105 but with many of them god was not well pleased for they were overthrown in the wilderness
1cor106 now these things were our examples to the intent we should not lust after evil things as they also lusted
1cor107 neither be ye idolaters as were some of them as it is written the people sat down to eat and drink and rose up to play
1cor108 neither let us commit fornication as some of them committed and fell in one day three and twenty thousand
1cor109 neither let us tempt christ as some of them also tempted and were destroyed of serpents
1cor1010 neither murmur ye as some of them also murmured and were destroyed of the destroyer
1cor1011 now all these things happened unto them for ensamples and they are written for our admonition upon whom the ends of the world are come
1cor1012 wherefore let him that thinketh he standeth take heed lest he fall
1cor1013 there hath no temptation taken you but such as is common to man but god is faithful who will not suffer you to be tempted above that ye are able but will with the temptation also make a way to escape that ye may be able to bear it
1cor1014 wherefore my dearly beloved flee from idolatry
1cor1015 i speak as to wise men judge ye what i say
1cor1016 the cup of blessing which we bless is it not the communion of the blood of christ the bread which we break is it not the communion of the body of christ
1cor1017 for we being many are one bread and one body for we are all partakers of that one bread
1cor1018 behold israel after the flesh are not they which eat of the sacrifices partakers of the altar
1cor1019 what say i then that the idol is any thing or that which is offered in sacrifice to idols is any thing
1cor1020 but i say that the things which the gentiles sacrifice they sacrifice to devils and not to god and i would not that ye should have fellowship with devils
1cor1021 ye cannot drink the cup of the lord and the cup of devils ye cannot be partakers of the lord's table and of the table of devils
1cor1022 do we provoke the lord to jealousy are we stronger than he
1cor1023 all things are lawful for me but all things are not expedient all things are lawful for me but all things edify not
1cor1024 let no man seek his own but every man another's wealth
1cor1025 whatsoever is sold in the shambles that eat asking no question for conscience sake
1cor1026 for the earth is the lord's and the fulness thereof
1cor1027 if any of them that believe not bid you to a feast and ye be disposed to go whatsoever is set before you eat asking no question for conscience sake
1cor1028 but if any man say unto you this is offered in sacrifice unto idols eat not for his sake that shewed it and for conscience sake for the earth is the lord's and the fulness thereof
1cor1029 conscience i say not thine own but of the other for why is my liberty judged of another man's conscience
1cor1030 for if i by grace be a partaker why am i evil spoken of for that for which i give thanks
