 but farewell it for i will use no art
 mad let us grant him then and now remains
 that we find out the cause of this effect
 or rather say the cause of this defect
 for this effect defective comes by cause
 thus it remains and the remainder thus perpend
 i have a daughterhave while she is mine
 who in her duty and obedience mark
 hath given me this now gather and surmise
 reads
 to the celestial and my soul's idol the most
 beautified ophelia'
 that's an ill phrase a vile phrase beautified is
 a vile phrase but you shall hear thus
 reads
 in her excellent white bosom these &c'
queen gertrude came this from hamlet to her
lord polonius good madam stay awhile i will be faithful
 reads
 doubt thou the stars are fire
 doubt that the sun doth move
 doubt truth to be a liar
 but never doubt i love
 o dear ophelia i am ill at these numbers
 i have not art to reckon my groans but that
 i love thee best o most best believe it adieu
 thine evermore most dear lady whilst
 this machine is to him hamlet'
 this in obedience hath my daughter shown me
 and more above hath his solicitings
 as they fell out by time by means and place
 all given to mine ear
king claudius but how hath she
 received his love
lord polonius what do you think of me
king claudius as of a man faithful and honourable
lord polonius i would fain prove so but what might you think
 when i had seen this hot love on the wing
 as i perceived it i must tell you that
 before my daughter told mewhat might you
 or my dear majesty your queen here think
 if i had play'd the desk or tablebook
 or given my heart a winking mute and dumb
 or look'd upon this love with idle sight
 what might you think no i went round to work
 and my young mistress thus i did bespeak
 lord hamlet is a prince out of thy star
 this must not be and then i precepts gave her
 that she should lock herself from his resort
 admit no messengers receive no tokens
 which done she took the fruits of my advice
 and he repulseda short tale to make
 fell into a sadness then into a fast
 thence to a watch thence into a weakness
 thence to a lightness and by this declension
 into the madness wherein now he raves
 and all we mourn for
king claudius do you think tis this
queen gertrude it may be very likely
lord polonius hath there been such a timei'd fain know that
 that i have positively said tis so'
 when it proved otherwise
king claudius not that i know
lord polonius pointing to his head and shoulder
 take this from this if this be otherwise
 if circumstances lead me i will find
 where truth is hid though it were hid indeed
 within the centre
king claudius how may we try it further
lord polonius you know sometimes he walks four hours together
 here in the lobby
queen gertrude so he does indeed
lord polonius at such a time i'll loose my daughter to him
 be you and i behind an arras then
 mark the encounter if he love her not
 and be not from his reason fall'n thereon
 let me be no assistant for a state
 but keep a farm and carters
king claudius we will try it
queen gertrude but look where sadly the poor wretch comes reading
lord polonius away i do beseech you both away
 i'll board him presently
 exeunt king claudius queen gertrude and
 attendants
 enter hamlet reading
 o give me leave
 how does my good lord hamlet
hamlet well godamercy
lord polonius do you know me my lord
hamlet excellent well you are a fishmonger
lord polonius not i my lord
hamlet then i would you were so honest a man
lord polonius honest my lord
hamlet ay sir to be honest as this world goes is to be
 one man picked out of ten thousand
lord polonius that's very true my lord
hamlet for if the sun breed maggots in a dead dog being a
 god kissing carrionhave you a daughter
lord polonius i have my lord
hamlet let her not walk i the sun conception is a
 blessing but not as your daughter may conceive
 friend look to t
lord polonius aside how say you by that still harping on my
 daughter yet he knew me not at first he said i
 was a fishmonger he is far gone far gone and
 truly in my youth i suffered much extremity for
 love very near this i'll speak to him again
 what do you read my lord
hamlet words words words
lord polonius what is the matter my lord
hamlet between who
lord polonius i mean the matter that you read my lord
hamlet slanders sir for the satirical rogue says here
 that old men have grey beards that their faces are
 wrinkled their eyes purging thick amber and
 plumtree gum and that they have a plentiful lack of
 wit together with most weak hams all which sir
 though i most powerfully and potently believe yet
 i hold it not honesty to have it thus set down for
 yourself sir should be old as i am if like a crab
 you could go backward
lord polonius aside though this be madness yet there is method
 in t will you walk out of the air my lord
hamlet into my grave
lord polonius indeed that is out o the air
 aside
 how pregnant sometimes his replies are a happiness
 that often madness hits on which reason and sanity
 could not so prosperously be delivered of i will
 leave him and suddenly contrive the means of
 meeting between him and my daughtermy honourable
 lord i will most humbly take my leave of you
hamlet you cannot sir take from me any thing that i will
 more willingly part withal except my life except
 my life except my life
lord polonius fare you well my lord
hamlet these tedious old fools
 enter rosencrantz and guildenstern
lord polonius you go to seek the lord hamlet there he is
rosencrantz to polonius god save you sir
 exit polonius
guildenstern my honoured lord
rosencrantz my most dear lord
hamlet my excellent good friends how dost thou
 guildenstern ah rosencrantz good lads how do ye both
rosencrantz as the indifferent children of the earth
guildenstern happy in that we are not overhappy
 on fortune's cap we are not the very button
hamlet nor the soles of her shoe
rosencrantz neither my lord
hamlet then you live about her waist or in the middle of
 her favours
guildenstern faith her privates we
hamlet in the secret parts of fortune o most true she
 is a strumpet what's the news
rosencrantz none my lord but that the world's grown honest
hamlet then is doomsday near but your news is not true
 let me question more in particular what have you
 my good friends deserved at the hands of fortune
 that she sends you to prison hither
guildenstern prison my lord
hamlet denmark's a prison
rosencrantz then is the world one
hamlet a goodly one in which there are many confines
 wards and dungeons denmark being one o the worst
rosencrantz we think not so my lord
hamlet why then tis none to you for there is nothing
 either good or bad but thinking makes it so to me
 it is a prison
rosencrantz why then your ambition makes it one tis too
 narrow for your mind
hamlet o god i could be bounded in a nut shell and count
 myself a king of infinite space were it not that i
 have bad dreams
guildenstern which dreams indeed are ambition for the very
 substance of the ambitious is merely the shadow of a dream
hamlet a dream itself is but a shadow
rosencrantz truly and i hold ambition of so airy and light a
 quality that it is but a shadow's shadow
hamlet then are our beggars bodies and our monarchs and
 outstretched heroes the beggars shadows shall we
 to the court for by my fay i cannot reason
rosencrantz 
 we'll wait upon you
guildenstern 
hamlet no such matter i will not sort you with the rest
 of my servants for to speak to you like an honest
 man i am most dreadfully attended but in the
 beaten way of friendship what make you at elsinore
rosencrantz to visit you my lord no other occasion
hamlet beggar that i am i am even poor in thanks but i
 thank you and sure dear friends my thanks are
 too dear a halfpenny were you not sent for is it
 your own inclining is it a free visitation come
 deal justly with me come come nay speak
guildenstern what should we say my lord
hamlet why any thing but to the purpose you were sent
 for and there is a kind of confession in your looks
 which your modesties have not craft enough to colour
 i know the good king and queen have sent for you
