 for deathlike dragons here affright thee hard
 her face like heaven enticeth thee to view
 her countless glory which desert must gain
 and which without desert because thine eye
 presumes to reach all thy whole heap must die
 yon sometimes famous princes like thyself
 drawn by report adventurous by desire
 tell thee with speechless tongues and semblance pale
 that without covering save yon field of stars
 here they stand martyrs slain in cupid's wars
 and with dead cheeks advise thee to desist
 for going on death's net whom none resist
pericles antiochus i thank thee who hath taught
 my frail mortality to know itself
 and by those fearful objects to prepare
 this body like to them to what i must
 for death remember'd should be like a mirror
 who tells us life's but breath to trust it error
 i'll make my will then and as sick men do
 who know the world see heaven but feeling woe
 gripe not at earthly joys as erst they did
 so i bequeath a happy peace to you
 and all good men as every prince should do
 my riches to the earth from whence they came
 but my unspotted fire of love to you
 to the daughter of antiochus
 thus ready for the way of life or death
 i wait the sharpest blow antiochus
antiochus scorning advice read the conclusion then
 which read and not expounded tis decreed
 as these before thee thou thyself shalt bleed
daughter of all say'd yet mayst thou prove prosperous
 of all say'd yet i wish thee happiness
pericles like a bold champion i assume the lists
 nor ask advice of any other thought
 but faithfulness and courage
 he reads the riddle
 i am no viper yet i feed
 on mother's flesh which did me breed
 i sought a husband in which labour
 i found that kindness in a father
 he's father son and husband mild
 i mother wife and yet his child
 how they may be and yet in two
 as you will live resolve it you
 sharp physic is the last but o you powers
 that give heaven countless eyes to view men's acts
 why cloud they not their sights perpetually
 if this be true which makes me pale to read it
 fair glass of light i loved you and could still
 takes hold of the hand of the daughter of antiochus
 were not this glorious casket stored with ill
 but i must tell you now my thoughts revolt
 for he's no man on whom perfections wait
 that knowing sin within will touch the gate
 you are a fair viol and your sense the strings
 who finger'd to make man his lawful music
 would draw heaven down and all the gods to hearken
 but being play'd upon before your time
 hell only danceth at so harsh a chime
 good sooth i care not for you
antiochus prince pericles touch not upon thy life
 for that's an article within our law
 as dangerous as the rest your time's expired
 either expound now or receive your sentence
pericles great king
 few love to hear the sins they love to act
 twould braid yourself too near for me to tell it
 who has a book of all that monarchs do
 he's more secure to keep it shut than shown
 for vice repeated is like the wandering wind
 blows dust in other's eyes to spread itself
 and yet the end of all is bought thus dear
 the breath is gone and the sore eyes see clear
 to stop the air would hurt them the blind mole casts
 copp'd hills towards heaven to tell the earth is throng'd
 by man's oppression and the poor worm doth die for't
 kings are earth's gods in vice their law's
 their will
 and if jove stray who dares say jove doth ill
 it is enough you know and it is fit
 what being more known grows worse to smother it
 all love the womb that their first being bred
 then give my tongue like leave to love my head
antiochus aside heaven that i had thy head he has found
 the meaning
 but i will gloze with himyoung prince of tyre
 though by the tenor of our strict edict
 your exposition misinterpreting
 we might proceed to cancel of your days
 yet hope succeeding from so fair a tree
 as your fair self doth tune us otherwise
 forty days longer we do respite you
 if by which time our secret be undone
 this mercy shows we'll joy in such a son
 and until then your entertain shall be
 as doth befit our honour and your worth
 exeunt all but pericles
pericles how courtesy would seem to cover sin
 when what is done is like an hypocrite
 the which is good in nothing but in sight
 if it be true that i interpret false
 then were it certain you were not so bad
 as with foul incest to abuse your soul
 where now you're both a father and a son
 by your untimely claspings with your child
 which pleasure fits an husband not a father
 and she an eater of her mother's flesh
 by the defiling of her parent's bed
 and both like serpents are who though they feed
 on sweetest flowers yet they poison breed
 antioch farewell for wisdom sees those men
 blush not in actions blacker than the night
 will shun no course to keep them from the light
 one sin i know another doth provoke
 murder's as near to lust as flame to smoke
 poison and treason are the hands of sin
 ay and the targets to put off the shame
 then lest my lie be cropp'd to keep you clear
 by flight i'll shun the danger which i fear
 exit
 reenter antiochus
antiochus he hath found the meaning for which we mean
 to have his head
 he must not live to trumpet forth my infamy
 nor tell the world antiochus doth sin
 in such a loathed manner
 and therefore instantly this prince must die
 for by his fall my honour must keep high
 who attends us there
 enter thaliard
thaliard doth your highness call
antiochus thaliard
 you are of our chamber and our mind partakes
 her private actions to your secrecy
 and for your faithfulness we will advance you
 thaliard behold here's poison and here's gold
 we hate the prince of tyre and thou must kill him
 it fits thee not to ask the reason why
 because we bid it say is it done
thaliard my lord
 tis done
antiochus enough
 enter a messenger
 let your breath cool yourself telling your haste
messenger my lord prince pericles is fled
 exit
antiochus as thou
 wilt live fly after and like an arrow shot
 from a wellexperienced archer hits the mark
 his eye doth level at so thou ne'er return
 unless thou say prince pericles is dead'
thaliard my lord
 if i can get him within my pistol's length
 i'll make him sure enough so farewell to your highness
antiochus thaliard adieu
 exit thaliard
 till pericles be dead
 my heart can lend no succor to my head
 exit
 pericles prince of tyre
act i
scene ii tyre a room in the palace
 enter pericles
pericles to lords without let none disturb uswhy should
 this change of thoughts
 the sad companion dulleyed melancholy
 be my so used a guest as not an hour
 in the day's glorious walk or peaceful night
 the tomb where grief should sleep can breed me quiet
 here pleasures court mine eyes and mine eyes shun them
 and danger which i fear'd is at antioch
 whose aim seems far too short to hit me here
 yet neither pleasure's art can joy my spirits
 nor yet the other's distance comfort me
 then it is thus the passions of the mind
 that have their first conception by misdread
 have afternourishment and life by care
 and what was first but fear what might be done
 grows elder now and cares it be not done
 and so with me the great antiochus
 gainst whom i am too little to contend
 since he's so great can make his will his act
 will think me speaking though i swear to silence
 nor boots it me to say i honour him
 if he suspect i may dishonour him
 and what may make him blush in being known
 he'll stop the course by which it might be known
 with hostile forces he'll o'erspread the land
 and with the ostent of war will look so huge
 amazement shall drive courage from the state
 our men be vanquish'd ere they do resist
 and subjects punish'd that ne'er thought offence
 which care of them not pity of myself
 who am no more but as the tops of trees
 which fence the roots they grow by and defend them
 makes both my body pine and soul to languish
 and punish that before that he would punish
 enter helicanus with other lords
first lord joy and all comfort in your sacred breast
