 you made in a day my lord whole towns to fly
 enter buckingham
king henry vi what tidings with our cousin buckingham
buckingham such as my heart doth tremble to unfold
 a sort of naughty persons lewdly bent
 under the countenance and confederacy
 of lady eleanor the protector's wife
 the ringleader and head of all this rout
 have practised dangerously against your state
 dealing with witches and with conjurers
 whom we have apprehended in the fact
 raising up wicked spirits from under ground
 demanding of king henry's life and death
 and other of your highness privycouncil
 as more at large your grace shall understand
cardinal aside to gloucester and so my lord protector
 by this means
 your lady is forthcoming yet at london
 this news i think hath turn'd your weapon's edge
 tis like my lord you will not keep your hour
gloucester ambitious churchman leave to afflict my heart
 sorrow and grief have vanquish'd all my powers
 and vanquish'd as i am i yield to thee
 or to the meanest groom
king henry vi o god what mischiefs work the wicked ones
 heaping confusion on their own heads thereby
queen margaret gloucester see here the tainture of thy nest
 and look thyself be faultless thou wert best
gloucester madam for myself to heaven i do appeal
 how i have loved my king and commonweal
 and for my wife i know not how it stands
 sorry i am to hear what i have heard
 noble she is but if she have forgot
 honour and virtue and conversed with such
 as like to pitch defile nobility
 i banish her my bed and company
 and give her as a prey to law and shame
 that hath dishonour'd gloucester's honest name
king henry vi well for this night we will repose us here
 tomorrow toward london back again
 to look into this business thoroughly
 and call these foul offenders to their answers
 and poise the cause in justice equal scales
 whose beam stands sure whose rightful cause prevails
 flourish exeunt
 2 king henry vi
act ii
scene ii london york's garden
 enter york salisbury and warwick
york now my good lords of salisbury and warwick
 our simple supper ended give me leave
 in this close walk to satisfy myself
 in craving your opinion of my title
 which is infallible to england's crown
salisbury my lord i long to hear it at full
warwick sweet york begin and if thy claim be good
 the nevils are thy subjects to command
york then thus
 edward the third my lords had seven sons
 the first edward the black prince prince of wales
 the second william of hatfield and the third
 lionel duke of clarence next to whom
 was john of gaunt the duke of lancaster
 the fifth was edmund langley duke of york
 the sixth was thomas of woodstock duke of gloucester
 william of windsor was the seventh and last
 edward the black prince died before his father
 and left behind him richard his only son
 who after edward the third's death reign'd as king
 till henry bolingbroke duke of lancaster
 the eldest son and heir of john of gaunt
 crown'd by the name of henry the fourth
 seized on the realm deposed the rightful king
 sent his poor queen to france from whence she came
 and him to pomfret where as all you know
 harmless richard was murder'd traitorously
warwick father the duke hath told the truth
 thus got the house of lancaster the crown
york which now they hold by force and not by right
 for richard the first son's heir being dead
 the issue of the next son should have reign'd
