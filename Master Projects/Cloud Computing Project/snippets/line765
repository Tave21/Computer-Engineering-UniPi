rivers madam we will attend your grace
 exeunt all but gloucester
gloucester i do the wrong and first begin to brawl
 the secret mischiefs that i set abroach
 i lay unto the grievous charge of others
 clarence whom i indeed have laid in darkness
 i do beweep to many simple gulls
 namely to hastings derby buckingham
 and say it is the queen and her allies
 that stir the king against the duke my brother
 now they believe it and withal whet me
 to be revenged on rivers vaughan grey
 but then i sigh and with a piece of scripture
 tell them that god bids us do good for evil
 and thus i clothe my naked villany
 with old odd ends stolen out of holy writ
 and seem a saint when most i play the devil
 enter two murderers
 but soft here come my executioners
 how now my hardy stout resolved mates
 are you now going to dispatch this deed
first murderer we are my lord and come to have the warrant
 that we may be admitted where he is
gloucester well thought upon i have it here about me
 gives the warrant
 when you have done repair to crosby place
 but sirs be sudden in the execution
 withal obdurate do not hear him plead
 for clarence is wellspoken and perhaps
 may move your hearts to pity if you mark him
first murderer tush
 fear not my lord we will not stand to prate
 talkers are no good doers be assured
 we come to use our hands and not our tongues
gloucester your eyes drop millstones when fools eyes drop tears
 i like you lads about your business straight
 go go dispatch
first murderer we will my noble lord
 exeunt
 king richard iii
act i
scene iv london the tower
 enter clarence and brakenbury
brakenbury why looks your grace so heavily today
clarence o i have pass'd a miserable night
 so full of ugly sights of ghastly dreams
 that as i am a christian faithful man
 i would not spend another such a night
 though twere to buy a world of happy days
 so full of dismal terror was the time
brakenbury what was your dream i long to hear you tell it
clarence methoughts that i had broken from the tower
 and was embark'd to cross to burgundy
 and in my company my brother gloucester
 who from my cabin tempted me to walk
 upon the hatches thence we looked toward england
 and cited up a thousand fearful times
 during the wars of york and lancaster
 that had befall'n us as we paced along
 upon the giddy footing of the hatches
 methought that gloucester stumbled and in falling
 struck me that thought to stay him overboard
 into the tumbling billows of the main
 lord lord methought what pain it was to drown
 what dreadful noise of waters in mine ears
 what ugly sights of death within mine eyes
 methought i saw a thousand fearful wrecks
 ten thousand men that fishes gnaw'd upon
 wedges of gold great anchors heaps of pearl
 inestimable stones unvalued jewels
 all scatter'd in the bottom of the sea
 some lay in dead men's skulls and in those holes
 where eyes did once inhabit there were crept
 as twere in scorn of eyes reflecting gems
 which woo'd the slimy bottom of the deep
 and mock'd the dead bones that lay scatter'd by
brakenbury had you such leisure in the time of death
 to gaze upon the secrets of the deep
clarence methought i had and often did i strive
 to yield the ghost but still the envious flood
 kept in my soul and would not let it forth
 to seek the empty vast and wandering air
 but smother'd it within my panting bulk
 which almost burst to belch it in the sea
brakenbury awaked you not with this sore agony
clarence o no my dream was lengthen'd after life
 o then began the tempest to my soul
 who pass'd methought the melancholy flood
 with that grim ferryman which poets write of
 unto the kingdom of perpetual night
 the first that there did greet my stranger soul
 was my great fatherinlaw renowned warwick
 who cried aloud what scourge for perjury
 can this dark monarchy afford false clarence'
 and so he vanish'd then came wandering by
 a shadow like an angel with bright hair
 dabbled in blood and he squeak'd out aloud
 clarence is come false fleeting perjured clarence
 that stabb'd me in the field by tewksbury
 seize on him furies take him to your torments'
 with that methoughts a legion of foul fiends
 environ'd me about and howled in mine ears
 such hideous cries that with the very noise
 i trembling waked and for a season after
 could not believe but that i was in hell
 such terrible impression made the dream
brakenbury no marvel my lord though it affrighted you
 i promise i am afraid to hear you tell it
clarence o brakenbury i have done those things
 which now bear evidence against my soul
 for edward's sake and see how he requites me
 o god if my deep prayers cannot appease thee
 but thou wilt be avenged on my misdeeds
 yet execute thy wrath in me alone
 o spare my guiltless wife and my poor children
 i pray thee gentle keeper stay by me
 my soul is heavy and i fain would sleep
brakenbury i will my lord god give your grace good rest
 clarence sleeps
 sorrow breaks seasons and reposing hours
 makes the night morning and the noontide night
 princes have but their tides for their glories
 an outward honour for an inward toil
 and for unfelt imagination
 they often feel a world of restless cares
 so that betwixt their tides and low names
 there's nothing differs but the outward fame
 enter the two murderers
first murderer ho who's here
brakenbury in god's name what are you and how came you hither
first murderer i would speak with clarence and i came hither on my legs
brakenbury yea are you so brief
second murderer o sir it is better to be brief than tedious show
 him our commission talk no more
 brakenbury reads it
brakenbury i am in this commanded to deliver
 the noble duke of clarence to your hands
 i will not reason what is meant hereby
 because i will be guiltless of the meaning
 here are the keys there sits the duke asleep
 i'll to the king and signify to him
 that thus i have resign'd my charge to you
first murderer do so it is a point of wisdom fare you well
 exit brakenbury
second murderer what shall we stab him as he sleeps
first murderer no then he will say twas done cowardly when he wakes
second murderer when he wakes why fool he shall never wake till
 the judgmentday
first murderer why then he will say we stabbed him sleeping
second murderer the urging of that word judgment hath bred a kind
 of remorse in me
first murderer what art thou afraid
second murderer not to kill him having a warrant for it but to be
 damned for killing him from which no warrant can defend us
first murderer i thought thou hadst been resolute
second murderer so i am to let him live
first murderer back to the duke of gloucester tell him so
second murderer i pray thee stay a while i hope my holy humour
 will change twas wont to hold me but while one
 would tell twenty
first murderer how dost thou feel thyself now
second murderer faith some certain dregs of conscience are yet
 within me
first murderer remember our reward when the deed is done
second murderer zounds he dies i had forgot the reward
first murderer where is thy conscience now
second murderer in the duke of gloucester's purse
first murderer so when he opens his purse to give us our reward
 thy conscience flies out
second murderer let it go there's few or none will entertain it
first murderer how if it come to thee again
second murderer i'll not meddle with it it is a dangerous thing it
 makes a man a coward a man cannot steal but it
 accuseth him he cannot swear but it cheques him
 he cannot lie with his neighbour's wife but it
 detects him tis a blushing shamefast spirit that
 mutinies in a man's bosom it fills one full of
 obstacles it made me once restore a purse of gold
 that i found it beggars any man that keeps it it
 is turned out of all towns and cities for a
 dangerous thing and every man that means to live
 well endeavours to trust to himself and to live
 without it
first murderer zounds it is even now at my elbow persuading me
 not to kill the duke
second murderer take the devil in thy mind and relieve him not he
 would insinuate with thee but to make thee sigh
first murderer tut i am strongframed he cannot prevail with me
 i warrant thee
second murderer spoke like a tail fellow that respects his
 reputation come shall we to this gear
first murderer take him over the costard with the hilts of thy
 sword and then we will chop him in the malmseybutt
 in the next room
second murderer o excellent devise make a sop of him
first murderer hark he stirs shall i strike
second murderer no first let's reason with him
clarence where art thou keeper give me a cup of wine
second murderer you shall have wine enough my lord anon
clarence in god's name what art thou
