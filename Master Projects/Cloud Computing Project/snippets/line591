 thou art not ignorant what dear good will
 i bear unto the banish'd valentine
 nor how my father would enforce me marry
 vain thurio whom my very soul abhors
 thyself hast loved and i have heard thee say
 no grief did ever come so near thy heart
 as when thy lady and thy true love died
 upon whose grave thou vow'dst pure chastity
 sir eglamour i would to valentine
 to mantua where i hear he makes abode
 and for the ways are dangerous to pass
 i do desire thy worthy company
 upon whose faith and honour i repose
 urge not my father's anger eglamour
 but think upon my grief a lady's grief
 and on the justice of my flying hence
 to keep me from a most unholy match
 which heaven and fortune still rewards with plagues
 i do desire thee even from a heart
 as full of sorrows as the sea of sands
 to bear me company and go with me
 if not to hide what i have said to thee
 that i may venture to depart alone
eglamour madam i pity much your grievances
 which since i know they virtuously are placed
 i give consent to go along with you
 recking as little what betideth me
 as much i wish all good befortune you
 when will you go
silvia this evening coming
eglamour where shall i meet you
silvia at friar patrick's cell
 where i intend holy confession
eglamour i will not fail your ladyship good morrow gentle lady
silvia good morrow kind sir eglamour
 exeunt severally
 the two gentlemen of verona
act iv
scene iv the same
 enter launce with his his dog
launce when a man's servant shall play the cur with him
 look you it goes hard one that i brought up of a
 puppy one that i saved from drowning when three or
 four of his blind brothers and sisters went to it
 i have taught him even as one would say precisely
 thus i would teach a dog i was sent to deliver
 him as a present to mistress silvia from my master
 and i came no sooner into the diningchamber but he
 steps me to her trencher and steals her capon's leg
 o tis a foul thing when a cur cannot keep himself
 in all companies i would have as one should say
 one that takes upon him to be a dog indeed to be
 as it were a dog at all things if i had not had
 more wit than he to take a fault upon me that he did
 i think verily he had been hanged for't sure as i
 live he had suffered for't you shall judge he
 thrusts me himself into the company of three or four
 gentlemanlike dogs under the duke's table he had
 not been therebless the marka pissing while but
 all the chamber smelt him out with the dog says
 one what cur is that says another whip him
 out says the third hang him up says the duke
 i having been acquainted with the smell before
 knew it was crab and goes me to the fellow that
 whips the dogs friend quoth i you mean to whip
 the dog ay marry do i quoth he you do him
 the more wrong quoth i 'twas i did the thing you
 wot of he makes me no more ado but whips me out
 of the chamber how many masters would do this for
 his servant nay i'll be sworn i have sat in the
 stocks for puddings he hath stolen otherwise he had
 been executed i have stood on the pillory for geese
 he hath killed otherwise he had suffered for't
 thou thinkest not of this now nay i remember the
 trick you served me when i took my leave of madam
 silvia did not i bid thee still mark me and do as i
 do when didst thou see me heave up my leg and make
 water against a gentlewoman's farthingale didst
 thou ever see me do such a trick
 enter proteus and julia
proteus sebastian is thy name i like thee well
 and will employ thee in some service presently
julia in what you please i'll do what i can
proteus i hope thou wilt
 to launce
 how now you whoreson peasant
 where have you been these two days loitering
launce marry sir i carried mistress silvia the dog you bade me
proteus and what says she to my little jewel
launce marry she says your dog was a cur and tells you
 currish thanks is good enough for such a present
proteus but she received my dog
launce no indeed did she not here have i brought him
 back again
proteus what didst thou offer her this from me
launce ay sir the other squirrel was stolen from me by
 the hangman boys in the marketplace and then i
 offered her mine own who is a dog as big as ten of
 yours and therefore the gift the greater
proteus go get thee hence and find my dog again
 or ne'er return again into my sight
 away i say stay'st thou to vex me here
 exit launce
 a slave that still an end turns me to shame
 sebastian i have entertained thee
 partly that i have need of such a youth
 that can with some discretion do my business
 for tis no trusting to yond foolish lout
 but chiefly for thy face and thy behavior
 which if my augury deceive me not
 witness good bringing up fortune and truth
 therefore know thou for this i entertain thee
 go presently and take this ring with thee
 deliver it to madam silvia
 she loved me well deliver'd it to me
julia it seems you loved not her to leave her token
 she is dead belike
proteus not so i think she lives
julia alas
proteus why dost thou cry alas'
julia i cannot choose
 but pity her
proteus wherefore shouldst thou pity her
julia because methinks that she loved you as well
 as you do love your lady silvia
 she dreams of him that has forgot her love
 you dote on her that cares not for your love
 tis pity love should be so contrary
 and thinking of it makes me cry alas'
proteus well give her that ring and therewithal
 this letter that's her chamber tell my lady
 i claim the promise for her heavenly picture
 your message done hie home unto my chamber
 where thou shalt find me sad and solitary
 exit
julia how many women would do such a message
 alas poor proteus thou hast entertain'd
 a fox to be the shepherd of thy lambs
 alas poor fool why do i pity him
 that with his very heart despiseth me
 because he loves her he despiseth me
 because i love him i must pity him
 this ring i gave him when he parted from me
 to bind him to remember my good will
 and now am i unhappy messenger
 to plead for that which i would not obtain
 to carry that which i would have refused
 to praise his faith which i would have dispraised
 i am my master's trueconfirmed love
 but cannot be true servant to my master
 unless i prove false traitor to myself
 yet will i woo for him but yet so coldly
 as heaven it knows i would not have him speed
 enter silvia attended
 gentlewoman good day i pray you be my mean
 to bring me where to speak with madam silvia
silvia what would you with her if that i be she
julia if you be she i do entreat your patience
 to hear me speak the message i am sent on
silvia from whom
julia from my master sir proteus madam
silvia o he sends you for a picture
julia ay madam
silvia ursula bring my picture here
 go give your master this tell him from me
 one julia that his changing thoughts forget
 would better fit his chamber than this shadow
julia madam please you peruse this letter
 pardon me madam i have unadvised
 deliver'd you a paper that i should not
 this is the letter to your ladyship
silvia i pray thee let me look on that again
julia it may not be good madam pardon me
silvia there hold
 i will not look upon your master's lines
 i know they are stuff'd with protestations
 and full of newfound oaths which he will break
 as easily as i do tear his paper
julia madam he sends your ladyship this ring
silvia the more shame for him that he sends it me
 for i have heard him say a thousand times
 his julia gave it him at his departure
 though his false finger have profaned the ring
 mine shall not do his julia so much wrong
julia she thanks you
silvia what say'st thou
julia i thank you madam that you tender her
 poor gentlewoman my master wrongs her much
silvia dost thou know her
julia almost as well as i do know myself
 to think upon her woes i do protest
 that i have wept a hundred several times
silvia belike she thinks that proteus hath forsook her
julia i think she doth and that's her cause of sorrow
silvia is she not passing fair
julia she hath been fairer madam than she is
 when she did think my master loved her well
 she in my judgment was as fair as you
 but since she did neglect her lookingglass
 and threw her sunexpelling mask away
