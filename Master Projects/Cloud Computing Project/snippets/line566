 consort with me in loud and dear petition
 pursue we him on knees for i have dream'd
 of bloody turbulence and this whole night
 hath nothing been but shapes and forms of slaughter
cassandra o tis true
hector ho bid my trumpet sound
cassandra no notes of sally for the heavens sweet brother
hector be gone i say the gods have heard me swear
cassandra the gods are deaf to hot and peevish vows
 they are polluted offerings more abhorr'd
 than spotted livers in the sacrifice
andromache o be persuaded do not count it holy
 to hurt by being just it is as lawful
 for we would give much to use violent thefts
 and rob in the behalf of charity
cassandra it is the purpose that makes strong the vow
 but vows to every purpose must not hold
 unarm sweet hector
hector hold you still i say
 mine honour keeps the weather of my fate
 lie every man holds dear but the brave man
 holds honour far more preciousdear than life
 enter troilus
 how now young man mean'st thou to fight today
andromache cassandra call my father to persuade
 exit cassandra
hector no faith young troilus doff thy harness youth
 i am today i the vein of chivalry
 let grow thy sinews till their knots be strong
 and tempt not yet the brushes of the war
 unarm thee go and doubt thou not brave boy
 i'll stand today for thee and me and troy
troilus brother you have a vice of mercy in you
 which better fits a lion than a man
hector what vice is that good troilus chide me for it
troilus when many times the captive grecian falls
 even in the fan and wind of your fair sword
 you bid them rise and live
hector o'tis fair play
troilus fool's play by heaven hector
hector how now how now
troilus for the love of all the gods
 let's leave the hermit pity with our mothers
 and when we have our armours buckled on
 the venom'd vengeance ride upon our swords
 spur them to ruthful work rein them from ruth
hector fie savage fie
troilus hector then tis wars
hector troilus i would not have you fight today
troilus who should withhold me
 not fate obedience nor the hand of mars
 beckoning with fiery truncheon my retire
 not priamus and hecuba on knees
 their eyes o'ergalled with recourse of tears
 not you my brother with your true sword drawn
 opposed to hinder me should stop my way
 but by my ruin
 reenter cassandra with priam
cassandra lay hold upon him priam hold him fast
 he is thy crutch now if thou lose thy stay
 thou on him leaning and all troy on thee
 fall all together
priam come hector come go back
 thy wife hath dream'd thy mother hath had visions
 cassandra doth foresee and i myself
 am like a prophet suddenly enrapt
 to tell thee that this day is ominous
 therefore come back
hector aeneas is afield
 and i do stand engaged to many greeks
 even in the faith of valour to appear
 this morning to them
priam ay but thou shalt not go
hector i must not break my faith
 you know me dutiful therefore dear sir
 let me not shame respect but give me leave
 to take that course by your consent and voice
 which you do here forbid me royal priam
cassandra o priam yield not to him
andromache do not dear father
hector andromache i am offended with you
 upon the love you bear me get you in
 exit andromache
troilus this foolish dreaming superstitious girl
 makes all these bodements
cassandra o farewell dear hector
 look how thou diest look how thy eye turns pale
 look how thy wounds do bleed at many vents
 hark how troy roars how hecuba cries out
 how poor andromache shrills her dolours forth
 behold distraction frenzy and amazement
 like witless antics one another meet
 and all cry hector hector's dead o hector
troilus away away
cassandra farewell yet soft hector take my leave
 thou dost thyself and all our troy deceive
 exit
hector you are amazed my liege at her exclaim
 go in and cheer the town we'll forth and fight
 do deeds worth praise and tell you them at night
priam farewell the gods with safety stand about thee

 and what one thing what another that i shall
 leave you one o these days and i have a rheum
 in mine eyes too and such an ache in my bones
 that unless a man were cursed i cannot tell what
 to think on't what says she there
troilus words words mere words no matter from the heart
 the effect doth operate another way

 my love with words and errors still she feeds
 but edifies another with her deeds

 before the belching whale then is he yonder
