 the most replenished sweet work of nature
 that from the prime creation e'er she framed'
 thus both are gone with conscience and remorse
 they could not speak and so i left them both
 to bring this tidings to the bloody king
 and here he comes
 enter king richard iii
 all hail my sovereign liege
king richard iii kind tyrrel am i happy in thy news
tyrrel if to have done the thing you gave in charge
 beget your happiness be happy then
 for it is done my lord
king richard iii but didst thou see them dead
tyrrel i did my lord
king richard iii and buried gentle tyrrel
tyrrel the chaplain of the tower hath buried them
 but how or in what place i do not know
king richard iii come to me tyrrel soon at after supper
 and thou shalt tell the process of their death
 meantime but think how i may do thee good
 and be inheritor of thy desire
 farewell till soon
 exit tyrrel
 the son of clarence have i pent up close
 his daughter meanly have i match'd in marriage
 the sons of edward sleep in abraham's bosom
 and anne my wife hath bid the world good night
 now for i know the breton richmond aims
 at young elizabeth my brother's daughter
 and by that knot looks proudly o'er the crown
 to her i go a jolly thriving wooer
 enter catesby
catesby my lord
king richard iii good news or bad that thou comest in so bluntly
catesby bad news my lord ely is fled to richmond
 and buckingham back'd with the hardy welshmen
 is in the field and still his power increaseth
king richard iii ely with richmond troubles me more near
 than buckingham and his rashlevied army
 come i have heard that fearful commenting
 is leaden servitor to dull delay
 delay leads impotent and snailpaced beggary
 then fiery expedition be my wing
 jove's mercury and herald for a king
 come muster men my counsel is my shield
 we must be brief when traitors brave the field
 exeunt
 king richard iii
act iv
scene iv before the palace
 enter queen margaret
queen margaret so now prosperity begins to mellow
 and drop into the rotten mouth of death
 here in these confines slily have i lurk'd
 to watch the waning of mine adversaries
 a dire induction am i witness to
 and will to france hoping the consequence
 will prove as bitter black and tragical
 withdraw thee wretched margaret who comes here
 enter queen elizabeth and the duchess of york
queen elizabeth ah my young princes ah my tender babes
 my unblown flowers newappearing sweets
 if yet your gentle souls fly in the air
 and be not fix'd in doom perpetual
 hover about me with your airy wings
 and hear your mother's lamentation
queen margaret hover about her say that right for right
 hath dimm'd your infant morn to aged night
duchess of york so many miseries have crazed my voice
 that my woewearied tongue is mute and dumb
 edward plantagenet why art thou dead
queen margaret plantagenet doth quit plantagenet
 edward for edward pays a dying debt
queen elizabeth wilt thou o god fly from such gentle lambs
 and throw them in the entrails of the wolf
 when didst thou sleep when such a deed was done
queen margaret when holy harry died and my sweet son
duchess of york blind sight dead life poor mortal living ghost
 woe's scene world's shame grave's due by life usurp'd
 brief abstract and record of tedious days
 rest thy unrest on england's lawful earth
 sitting down
 unlawfully made drunk with innocents blood
queen elizabeth o that thou wouldst as well afford a grave
 as thou canst yield a melancholy seat
 then would i hide my bones not rest them here
 o who hath any cause to mourn but i
 sitting down by her
queen margaret if ancient sorrow be most reverend
 give mine the benefit of seniory
 and let my woes frown on the upper hand
 if sorrow can admit society
 sitting down with them
 tell o'er your woes again by viewing mine
 i had an edward till a richard kill'd him
 i had a harry till a richard kill'd him
 thou hadst an edward till a richard kill'd him
 thou hadst a richard till a richard killed him
duchess of york i had a richard too and thou didst kill him
 i had a rutland too thou holp'st to kill him
queen margaret thou hadst a clarence too and richard kill'd him
 from forth the kennel of thy womb hath crept
 a hellhound that doth hunt us all to death
 that dog that had his teeth before his eyes
 to worry lambs and lap their gentle blood
 that foul defacer of god's handiwork
 that excellent grand tyrant of the earth
 that reigns in galled eyes of weeping souls
 thy womb let loose to chase us to our graves
 o upright just and truedisposing god
 how do i thank thee that this carnal cur
 preys on the issue of his mother's body
 and makes her pewfellow with others moan
duchess of york o harry's wife triumph not in my woes
 god witness with me i have wept for thine
queen margaret bear with me i am hungry for revenge
 and now i cloy me with beholding it
 thy edward he is dead that stabb'd my edward
 thy other edward dead to quit my edward
 young york he is but boot because both they
 match not the high perfection of my loss
 thy clarence he is dead that kill'd my edward
 and the beholders of this tragic play
 the adulterate hastings rivers vaughan grey
 untimely smother'd in their dusky graves
 richard yet lives hell's black intelligencer
 only reserved their factor to buy souls
 and send them thither but at hand at hand
 ensues his piteous and unpitied end
 earth gapes hell burns fiends roar saints pray
 to have him suddenly convey'd away
 cancel his bond of life dear god i prey
 that i may live to say the dog is dead
queen elizabeth o thou didst prophesy the time would come
 that i should wish for thee to help me curse
 that bottled spider that foul bunchback'd toad
queen margaret i call'd thee then vain flourish of my fortune
 i call'd thee then poor shadow painted queen
 the presentation of but what i was
 the flattering index of a direful pageant
 one heaved ahigh to be hurl'd down below
 a mother only mock'd with two sweet babes
 a dream of what thou wert a breath a bubble
 a sign of dignity a garish flag
 to be the aim of every dangerous shot
 a queen in jest only to fill the scene
 where is thy husband now where be thy brothers
 where are thy children wherein dost thou joy
 who sues to thee and cries god save the queen'
 where be the bending peers that flatter'd thee
 where be the thronging troops that follow'd thee
 decline all this and see what now thou art
 for happy wife a most distressed widow
 for joyful mother one that wails the name
 for queen a very caitiff crown'd with care
 for one being sued to one that humbly sues
 for one that scorn'd at me now scorn'd of me
 for one being fear'd of all now fearing one
 for one commanding all obey'd of none
 thus hath the course of justice wheel'd about
 and left thee but a very prey to time
 having no more but thought of what thou wert
 to torture thee the more being what thou art
 thou didst usurp my place and dost thou not
 usurp the just proportion of my sorrow
 now thy proud neck bears half my burthen'd yoke
 from which even here i slip my weary neck
 and leave the burthen of it all on thee
 farewell york's wife and queen of sad mischance
 these english woes will make me smile in france
queen elizabeth o thou well skill'd in curses stay awhile
 and teach me how to curse mine enemies
queen margaret forbear to sleep the nights and fast the days
 compare dead happiness with living woe
 think that thy babes were fairer than they were
 and he that slew them fouler than he is
 bettering thy loss makes the bad causer worse
 revolving this will teach thee how to curse
queen elizabeth my words are dull o quicken them with thine
queen margaret thy woes will make them sharp and pierce like mine
 exit
duchess of york why should calamity be full of words
queen elizabeth windy attorneys to their client woes
 airy succeeders of intestate joys
 poor breathing orators of miseries
 let them have scope though what they do impart
 help not all yet do they ease the heart
duchess of york if so then be not tonguetied go with me
 and in the breath of bitter words let's smother
 my damned son which thy two sweet sons smother'd
 i hear his drum be copious in exclaims
 enter king richard iii marching with drums and trumpets
king richard iii who intercepts my expedition
duchess of york o she that might have intercepted thee
 by strangling thee in her accursed womb
 from all the slaughters wretch that thou hast done
queen elizabeth hidest thou that forehead with a golden crown
 where should be graven if that right were right
 the slaughter of the prince that owed that crown
 and the dire death of my two sons and brothers
