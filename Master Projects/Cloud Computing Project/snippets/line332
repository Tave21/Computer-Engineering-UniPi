in several disports whereupon the noblemen yielded collatinus
the victory and his wife the fame at that time sextus
tarquinius being inflamed with lucrece beauty yet smothering
his passions for the present departed with the rest back to the
camp from whence he shortly after privily withdrew himself and
was according to his estate royally entertained and lodged by
lucrece at collatium the same night he treacherously stealeth
into her chamber violently ravished her and early in the
morning speedeth away lucrece in this lamentable plight
hastily dispatcheth messengers one to rome for her father
another to the camp for collatine they came the one
accompanied with junius brutus the other with publius valerius
and finding lucrece attired in mourning habit demanded the cause
of her sorrow she first taking an oath of them for her
revenge revealed the actor and whole manner of his dealing and
withal suddenly stabbed herself which done with one consent
they all vowed to root out the whole hated family of the
tarquins and bearing the dead body to rome brutus acquainted
the people with the doer and manner of the vile deed with a
bitter invective against the tyranny of the king wherewith the
people were so moved that with one consent and a general
acclamation the tarquins were all exiled and the state
government changed from kings to consuls
 the rape of lucrece
from the besieged ardea all in post
borne by the trustless wings of false desire
lustbreathed tarquin leaves the roman host
and to collatium bears the lightless fire
which in pale embers hid lurks to aspire
and girdle with embracing flames the waist
of collatine's fair love lucrece the chaste
haply that name of chaste unhappily set
this bateless edge on his keen appetite
when collatine unwisely did not let
to praise the clear unmatched red and white
which triumph'd in that sky of his delight
where mortal stars as bright as heaven's beauties
with pure aspects did him peculiar duties
for he the night before in tarquin's tent
unlock'd the treasure of his happy state
what priceless wealth the heavens had him lent
in the possession of his beauteous mate
reckoning his fortune at such highproud rate
that kings might be espoused to more fame
but king nor peer to such a peerless dame
o happiness enjoy'd but of a few
and if possess'd as soon decay'd and done
as is the morning's silvermelting dew
against the golden splendor of the sun
an expired date cancell'd ere well begun
honour and beauty in the owner's arms
are weakly fortress'd from a world of harms
beauty itself doth of itself persuade
the eyes of men without an orator
what needeth then apologies be made
to set forth that which is so singular
or why is collatine the publisher
of that rich jewel he should keep unknown
from thievish ears because it is his own
perchance his boast of lucrece sovereignty
suggested this proud issue of a king
for by our ears our hearts oft tainted be
perchance that envy of so rich a thing
braving compare disdainfully did sting
his highpitch'd thoughts that meaner men should vaunt
that golden hap which their superiors want
but some untimely thought did instigate
his alltootimeless speed if none of those
his honour his affairs his friends his state
neglected all with swift intent he goes
to quench the coal which in his liver glows
o rash false heat wrapp'd in repentant cold
thy hasty spring still blasts and ne'er grows old
when at collatium this false lord arrived
well was he welcomed by the roman dame
within whose face beauty and virtue strived
which of them both should underprop her fame
when virtue bragg'd beauty would blush for shame
when beauty boasted blushes in despite
virtue would stain that o'er with silver white
but beauty in that white intituled
from venus doves doth challenge that fair field
then virtue claims from beauty beauty's red
which virtue gave the golden age to gild
their silver cheeks and call'd it then their shield
teaching them thus to use it in the fight
when shame assail'd the red should fence the white
this heraldry in lucrece face was seen
argued by beauty's red and virtue's white
of either's colour was the other queen
proving from world's minority their right
yet their ambition makes them still to fight
the sovereignty of either being so great
that oft they interchange each other's seat
their silent war of lilies and of roses
which tarquin view'd in her fair face's field
in their pure ranks his traitor eye encloses
where lest between them both it should be kill'd
the coward captive vanquished doth yield
to those two armies that would let him go
rather than triumph in so false a foe
now thinks he that her husband's shallow tongue
the niggard prodigal that praised her so
in that high task hath done her beauty wrong
which far exceeds his barren skill to show
therefore that praise which collatine doth owe
enchanted tarquin answers with surmise
in silent wonder of stillgazing eyes
this earthly saint adored by this devil
little suspecteth the false worshipper
for unstain'd thoughts do seldom dream on evil
birds never limed no secret bushes fear
so guiltless she securely gives good cheer
and reverend welcome to her princely guest
whose inward ill no outward harm express'd
for that he colour'd with his high estate
hiding base sin in plaits of majesty
that nothing in him seem'd inordinate
save something too much wonder of his eye
which having all all could not satisfy
but poorly rich so wanteth in his store
that cloy'd with much he pineth still for more
but she that never coped with stranger eyes
could pick no meaning from their parling looks
nor read the subtleshining secrecies
writ in the glassy margents of such books
she touch'd no unknown baits nor fear'd no hooks
nor could she moralize his wanton sight
more than his eyes were open'd to the light
he stories to her ears her husband's fame
won in the fields of fruitful italy
and decks with praises collatine's high name
made glorious by his manly chivalry
with bruised arms and wreaths of victory
her joy with heavedup hand she doth express
and wordless so greets heaven for his success
far from the purpose of his coming hither
he makes excuses for his being there
no cloudy show of stormy blustering weather
doth yet in his fair welkin once appear
till sable night mother of dread and fear
upon the world dim darkness doth display
and in her vaulty prison stows the day
for then is tarquin brought unto his bed
intending weariness with heavy spright
for after supper long he questioned
with modest lucrece and wore out the night
now leaden slumber with life's strength doth fight
and every one to rest themselves betake
save thieves and cares and troubled minds that wake
as one of which doth tarquin lie revolving
the sundry dangers of his will's obtaining
yet ever to obtain his will resolving
though weakbuilt hopes persuade him to abstaining
despair to gain doth traffic oft for gaining
and when great treasure is the meed proposed
though death be adjunct there's no death supposed
those that much covet are with gain so fond
for what they have not that which they possess
they scatter and unloose it from their bond
and so by hoping more they have but less
or gaining more the profit of excess
is but to surfeit and such griefs sustain
that they prove bankrupt in this poorrich gain
the aim of all is but to nurse the life
with honour wealth and ease in waning age
and in this aim there is such thwarting strife
that one for all or all for one we gage
as life for honour in fell battle's rage
honour for wealth and oft that wealth doth cost
the death of all and all together lost
so that in venturing ill we leave to be
the things we are for that which we expect
and this ambitious foul infirmity
in having much torments us with defect
of that we have so then we do neglect
the thing we have and all for want of wit
make something nothing by augmenting it
such hazard now must doting tarquin make
pawning his honour to obtain his lust
and for himself himself be must forsake
then where is truth if there be no selftrust
when shall he think to find a stranger just
when he himself himself confounds betrays
to slanderous tongues and wretched hateful days
now stole upon the time the dead of night
when heavy sleep had closed up mortal eyes
no comfortable star did lend his light
no noise but owls and wolves deathboding cries
now serves the season that they may surprise
the silly lambs pure thoughts are dead and still
while lust and murder wake to stain and kill
and now this lustful lord leap'd from his bed
throwing his mantle rudely o'er his arm
is madly toss'd between desire and dread
th one sweetly flatters th other feareth harm
but honest fear bewitch'd with lust's foul charm
doth too too oft betake him to retire
beaten away by brainsick rude desire
his falchion on a flint he softly smiteth
