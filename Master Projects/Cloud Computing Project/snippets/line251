albany ask him his purposes why he appears
 upon this call o the trumpet
herald what are you
 your name your quality and why you answer
 this present summons
edgar know my name is lost
 by treason's tooth baregnawn and cankerbit
 yet am i noble as the adversary
 i come to cope
albany which is that adversary
edgar what's he that speaks for edmund earl of gloucester
edmund himself what say'st thou to him
edgar draw thy sword
 that if my speech offend a noble heart
 thy arm may do thee justice here is mine
 behold it is the privilege of mine honours
 my oath and my profession i protest
 maugre thy strength youth place and eminence
 despite thy victor sword and firenew fortune
 thy valour and thy heart thou art a traitor
 false to thy gods thy brother and thy father
 conspirant gainst this highillustrious prince
 and from the extremest upward of thy head
 to the descent and dust below thy foot
 a most toadspotted traitor say thou no'
 this sword this arm and my best spirits are bent
 to prove upon thy heart whereto i speak
 thou liest
edmund in wisdom i should ask thy name
 but since thy outside looks so fair and warlike
 and that thy tongue some say of breeding breathes
 what safe and nicely i might well delay
 by rule of knighthood i disdain and spurn
 back do i toss these treasons to thy head
 with the hellhated lie o'erwhelm thy heart
 which for they yet glance by and scarcely bruise
 this sword of mine shall give them instant way
 where they shall rest for ever trumpets speak
 alarums they fight edmund falls
albany save him save him
goneril this is practise gloucester
 by the law of arms thou wast not bound to answer
 an unknown opposite thou art not vanquish'd
 but cozen'd and beguiled
albany shut your mouth dame
 or with this paper shall i stop it hold sir
 thou worse than any name read thine own evil
 no tearing lady i perceive you know it
 gives the letter to edmund
goneril say if i do the laws are mine not thine
 who can arraign me for't
albany most monstrous oh
 know'st thou this paper
goneril ask me not what i know
 exit
albany go after her she's desperate govern her
edmund what you have charged me with that have i done
 and more much more the time will bring it out
 tis past and so am i but what art thou
 that hast this fortune on me if thou'rt noble
 i do forgive thee
edgar let's exchange charity
 i am no less in blood than thou art edmund
 if more the more thou hast wrong'd me
 my name is edgar and thy father's son
 the gods are just and of our pleasant vices
 make instruments to plague us
 the dark and vicious place where thee he got
 cost him his eyes
edmund thou hast spoken right tis true
 the wheel is come full circle i am here
albany methought thy very gait did prophesy
 a royal nobleness i must embrace thee
 let sorrow split my heart if ever i
 did hate thee or thy father
edgar worthy prince i know't
albany where have you hid yourself
 how have you known the miseries of your father
edgar by nursing them my lord list a brief tale
 and when tis told o that my heart would burst
 the bloody proclamation to escape
 that follow'd me so nearo our lives sweetness
 that we the pain of death would hourly die
 rather than die at oncetaught me to shift
 into a madman's rags to assume a semblance
 that very dogs disdain'd and in this habit
 met i my father with his bleeding rings
 their precious stones new lost became his guide
 led him begg'd for him saved him from despair
 nevero faultreveal'd myself unto him
 until some halfhour past when i was arm'd
 not sure though hoping of this good success
 i ask'd his blessing and from first to last
 told him my pilgrimage but his flaw'd heart
 alack too weak the conflict to support
 twixt two extremes of passion joy and grief
 burst smilingly
edmund this speech of yours hath moved me
 and shall perchance do good but speak you on
 you look as you had something more to say
albany if there be more more woeful hold it in
 for i am almost ready to dissolve
 hearing of this
edgar this would have seem'd a period
 to such as love not sorrow but another
 to amplify too much would make much more
 and top extremity
 whilst i was big in clamour came there in a man
 who having seen me in my worst estate
 shunn'd my abhorr'd society but then finding
 who twas that so endured with his strong arms
 he fastened on my neck and bellow'd out
 as he'ld burst heaven threw him on my father
 told the most piteous tale of lear and him
 that ever ear received which in recounting
 his grief grew puissant and the strings of life
 began to crack twice then the trumpets sounded
 and there i left him tranced
albany but who was this
edgar kent sir the banish'd kent who in disguise
 follow'd his enemy king and did him service
 improper for a slave
 enter a gentleman with a bloody knife
gentleman help help o help
edgar what kind of help
albany speak man
edgar what means that bloody knife
gentleman tis hot it smokes
 it came even from the heart ofo she's dead
albany who dead speak man
gentleman your lady sir your lady and her sister
 by her is poisoned she hath confess'd it
edmund i was contracted to them both all three
 now marry in an instant
edgar here comes kent
albany produce their bodies be they alive or dead
 this judgment of the heavens that makes us tremble
 touches us not with pity
 exit gentleman
 enter kent

 the time will not allow the compliment
 which very manners urges
kent i am come
 to bid my king and master aye good night

 see'st thou this object kent
 the bodies of goneril and regan are brought in
kent alack why thus
edmund yet edmund was beloved
 the one the other poison'd for my sake
 and after slew herself
albany even so cover their faces
edmund i pant for life some good i mean to do
 despite of mine own nature quickly send
 be brief in it to the castle for my writ
 is on the life of lear and on cordelia
 nay send in time
albany run run o run
edgar to who my lord who hath the office send
 thy token of reprieve
edmund well thought on take my sword
 give it the captain
albany haste thee for thy life
 exit edgar
edmund he hath commission from thy wife and me
 to hang cordelia in the prison and
 to lay the blame upon her own despair
 that she fordid herself
albany the gods defend her bear him hence awhile
 edmund is borne off
 reenter king lear with cordelia dead in his arms
 edgar captain and others following
king lear howl howl howl howl o you are men of stones
 had i your tongues and eyes i'ld use them so
 that heaven's vault should crack she's gone for ever
 i know when one is dead and when one lives
 she's dead as earth lend me a lookingglass
 if that her breath will mist or stain the stone
 why then she lives
kent is this the promised end
edgar or image of that horror
albany fall and cease
king lear this feather stirs she lives if it be so
 it is a chance which does redeem all sorrows
 that ever i have felt
kent kneeling o my good master
king lear prithee away
edgar tis noble kent your friend
king lear a plague upon you murderers traitors all
 i might have saved her now she's gone for ever
 cordelia cordelia stay a little ha
 what is't thou say'st her voice was ever soft
 gentle and low an excellent thing in woman
 i kill'd the slave that was ahanging thee
captain tis true my lords he did
king lear did i not fellow
 i have seen the day with my good biting falchion
