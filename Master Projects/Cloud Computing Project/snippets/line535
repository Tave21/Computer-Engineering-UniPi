 the taming of the shrew
act v
scene ii padua lucentio's house
 enter baptista vincentio gremio the pedant
 lucentio bianca petruchio katharina hortensio
 and widow tranio biondello and grumio the
 servingmen with tranio bringing in a banquet
lucentio at last though long our jarring notes agree
 and time it is when raging war is done
 to smile at scapes and perils overblown
 my fair bianca bid my father welcome
 while i with selfsame kindness welcome thine
 brother petruchio sister katharina
 and thou hortensio with thy loving widow
 feast with the best and welcome to my house
 my banquet is to close our stomachs up
 after our great good cheer pray you sit down
 for now we sit to chat as well as eat
petruchio nothing but sit and sit and eat and eat
baptista padua affords this kindness son petruchio
petruchio padua affords nothing but what is kind
hortensio for both our sakes i would that word were true
petruchio now for my life hortensio fears his widow
widow then never trust me if i be afeard
petruchio you are very sensible and yet you miss my sense
 i mean hortensio is afeard of you
widow he that is giddy thinks the world turns round
petruchio roundly replied
katharina mistress how mean you that
widow thus i conceive by him
petruchio conceives by me how likes hortensio that
hortensio my widow says thus she conceives her tale
petruchio very well mended kiss him for that good widow
katharina he that is giddy thinks the world turns round'
 i pray you tell me what you meant by that
widow your husband being troubled with a shrew
 measures my husband's sorrow by his woe
 and now you know my meaning
katharina a very mean meaning
widow right i mean you
katharina and i am mean indeed respecting you
petruchio to her kate
hortensio to her widow
petruchio a hundred marks my kate does put her down
hortensio that's my office
petruchio spoke like an officer ha to thee lad
 drinks to hortensio
baptista how likes gremio these quickwitted folks
gremio believe me sir they butt together well
bianca head and butt an hastywitted body
 would say your head and butt were head and horn
vincentio ay mistress bride hath that awaken'd you
bianca ay but not frighted me therefore i'll sleep again
petruchio nay that you shall not since you have begun
 have at you for a bitter jest or two
bianca am i your bird i mean to shift my bush
 and then pursue me as you draw your bow
 you are welcome all
 exeunt bianca katharina and widow
petruchio she hath prevented me here signior tranio
 this bird you aim'd at though you hit her not
 therefore a health to all that shot and miss'd
tranio o sir lucentio slipp'd me like his greyhound
 which runs himself and catches for his master
petruchio a good swift simile but something currish
tranio tis well sir that you hunted for yourself
 tis thought your deer does hold you at a bay
baptista o ho petruchio tranio hits you now
lucentio i thank thee for that gird good tranio
hortensio confess confess hath he not hit you here
petruchio a has a little gall'd me i confess
 and as the jest did glance away from me
 tis ten to one it maim'd you two outright
baptista now in good sadness son petruchio
 i think thou hast the veriest shrew of all
petruchio well i say no and therefore for assurance
 let's each one send unto his wife
 and he whose wife is most obedient
 to come at first when he doth send for her
 shall win the wager which we will propose
hortensio content what is the wager
lucentio twenty crowns
petruchio twenty crowns
 i'll venture so much of my hawk or hound
 but twenty times so much upon my wife
