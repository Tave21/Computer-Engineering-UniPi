scene i london a street
 enter gloucester solus
gloucester now is the winter of our discontent
 made glorious summer by this sun of york
 and all the clouds that lour'd upon our house
 in the deep bosom of the ocean buried
 now are our brows bound with victorious wreaths
 our bruised arms hung up for monuments
 our stern alarums changed to merry meetings
 our dreadful marches to delightful measures
 grimvisaged war hath smooth'd his wrinkled front
 and now instead of mounting barded steeds
 to fright the souls of fearful adversaries
 he capers nimbly in a lady's chamber
 to the lascivious pleasing of a lute
 but i that am not shaped for sportive tricks
 nor made to court an amorous lookingglass
 i that am rudely stamp'd and want love's majesty
 to strut before a wanton ambling nymph
 i that am curtail'd of this fair proportion
 cheated of feature by dissembling nature
 deformed unfinish'd sent before my time
 into this breathing world scarce half made up
 and that so lamely and unfashionable
 that dogs bark at me as i halt by them
 why i in this weak piping time of peace
 have no delight to pass away the time
 unless to spy my shadow in the sun
 and descant on mine own deformity
 and therefore since i cannot prove a lover
 to entertain these fair wellspoken days
 i am determined to prove a villain
 and hate the idle pleasures of these days
 plots have i laid inductions dangerous
 by drunken prophecies libels and dreams
 to set my brother clarence and the king
 in deadly hate the one against the other
 and if king edward be as true and just
 as i am subtle false and treacherous
 this day should clarence closely be mew'd up
 about a prophecy which says that g'
 of edward's heirs the murderer shall be
 dive thoughts down to my soul here
 clarence comes
 enter clarence guarded and brakenbury
 brother good day what means this armed guard
 that waits upon your grace
clarence his majesty
 tendering my person's safety hath appointed
 this conduct to convey me to the tower
gloucester upon what cause
clarence because my name is george
gloucester alack my lord that fault is none of yours
 he should for that commit your godfathers
 o belike his majesty hath some intent
 that you shall be newchristen'd in the tower
 but what's the matter clarence may i know
clarence yea richard when i know for i protest
 as yet i do not but as i can learn
 he hearkens after prophecies and dreams
 and from the crossrow plucks the letter g
 and says a wizard told him that by g
 his issue disinherited should be
 and for my name of george begins with g
 it follows in his thought that i am he
 these as i learn and such like toys as these
 have moved his highness to commit me now
gloucester why this it is when men are ruled by women
 tis not the king that sends you to the tower
 my lady grey his wife clarence tis she
 that tempers him to this extremity
 was it not she and that good man of worship
 anthony woodville her brother there
 that made him send lord hastings to the tower
 from whence this present day he is deliver'd
 we are not safe clarence we are not safe
clarence by heaven i think there's no man is secure
 but the queen's kindred and nightwalking heralds
 that trudge betwixt the king and mistress shore
 heard ye not what an humble suppliant
 lord hastings was to her for his delivery
gloucester humbly complaining to her deity
 got my lord chamberlain his liberty
 i'll tell you what i think it is our way
 if we will keep in favour with the king
 to be her men and wear her livery
 the jealous o'erworn widow and herself
 since that our brother dubb'd them gentlewomen
 are mighty gossips in this monarchy
brakenbury i beseech your graces both to pardon me
 his majesty hath straitly given in charge
 that no man shall have private conference
 of what degree soever with his brother
gloucester even so an't please your worship brakenbury
 you may partake of any thing we say
 we speak no treason man we say the king
 is wise and virtuous and his noble queen
 well struck in years fair and not jealous
 we say that shore's wife hath a pretty foot
 a cherry lip a bonny eye a passing pleasing tongue
 and that the queen's kindred are made gentlefolks
 how say you sir can you deny all this
brakenbury with this my lord myself have nought to do
gloucester naught to do with mistress shore i tell thee fellow
 he that doth naught with her excepting one
 were best he do it secretly alone
brakenbury what one my lord
gloucester her husband knave wouldst thou betray me
brakenbury i beseech your grace to pardon me and withal
 forbear your conference with the noble duke
clarence we know thy charge brakenbury and will obey
gloucester we are the queen's abjects and must obey
 brother farewell i will unto the king
 and whatsoever you will employ me in
 were it to call king edward's widow sister
 i will perform it to enfranchise you
 meantime this deep disgrace in brotherhood
 touches me deeper than you can imagine
clarence i know it pleaseth neither of us well
gloucester well your imprisonment shall not be long
 meantime have patience
clarence i must perforce farewell
 exeunt clarence brakenbury and guard
gloucester go tread the path that thou shalt ne'er return
 simple plain clarence i do love thee so
 that i will shortly send thy soul to heaven
 if heaven will take the present at our hands
 but who comes here the newdeliver'd hastings
 enter hastings
hastings good time of day unto my gracious lord
gloucester as much unto my good lord chamberlain
 well are you welcome to the open air
 how hath your lordship brook'd imprisonment
hastings with patience noble lord as prisoners must
 but i shall live my lord to give them thanks
 that were the cause of my imprisonment
gloucester no doubt no doubt and so shall clarence too
 for they that were your enemies are his
 and have prevail'd as much on him as you
hastings more pity that the eagle should be mew'd
 while kites and buzzards prey at liberty
gloucester what news abroad
hastings no news so bad abroad as this at home
 the king is sickly weak and melancholy
 and his physicians fear him mightily
gloucester now by saint paul this news is bad indeed
 o he hath kept an evil diet long
 and overmuch consumed his royal person
 tis very grievous to be thought upon
 what is he in his bed
hastings he is
gloucester go you before and i will follow you
 exit hastings
 he cannot live i hope and must not die
 till george be pack'd with posthorse up to heaven
 i'll in to urge his hatred more to clarence
 with lies well steel'd with weighty arguments
 and if i fall not in my deep intent
 clarence hath not another day to live
 which done god take king edward to his mercy
 and leave the world for me to bustle in
 for then i'll marry warwick's youngest daughter
 what though i kill'd her husband and her father
 the readiest way to make the wench amends
 is to become her husband and her father
 the which will i not all so much for love
 as for another secret close intent
 by marrying her which i must reach unto
 but yet i run before my horse to market
 clarence still breathes edward still lives and reigns
 when they are gone then must i count my gains
 exit
 king richard iii
act i
scene ii the same another street
 enter the corpse of king henry the sixth gentlemen
 with halberds to guard it lady anne being the mourner
lady anne set down set down your honourable load
 if honour may be shrouded in a hearse
 whilst i awhile obsequiously lament
 the untimely fall of virtuous lancaster
 poor keycold figure of a holy king
 pale ashes of the house of lancaster
 thou bloodless remnant of that royal blood
 be it lawful that i invocate thy ghost
 to hear the lamentations of poor anne
 wife to thy edward to thy slaughter'd son
 stabb'd by the selfsame hand that made these wounds
 lo in these windows that let forth thy life
 i pour the helpless balm of my poor eyes
 cursed be the hand that made these fatal holes
 cursed be the heart that had the heart to do it
 cursed the blood that let this blood from hence
 more direful hap betide that hated wretch
 that makes us wretched by the death of thee
 than i can wish to adders spiders toads
 or any creeping venom'd thing that lives
 if ever he have child abortive be it
 prodigious and untimely brought to light
 whose ugly and unnatural aspect
