 may fright the hopeful mother at the view
 and that be heir to his unhappiness
 if ever he have wife let her he made
 a miserable by the death of him
 as i am made by my poor lord and thee
 come now towards chertsey with your holy load
 taken from paul's to be interred there
 and still as you are weary of the weight
 rest you whiles i lament king henry's corse
 enter gloucester
gloucester stay you that bear the corse and set it down
lady anne what black magician conjures up this fiend
 to stop devoted charitable deeds
gloucester villains set down the corse or by saint paul
 i'll make a corse of him that disobeys
gentleman my lord stand back and let the coffin pass
gloucester unmanner'd dog stand thou when i command
 advance thy halbert higher than my breast
 or by saint paul i'll strike thee to my foot
 and spurn upon thee beggar for thy boldness
lady anne what do you tremble are you all afraid
 alas i blame you not for you are mortal
 and mortal eyes cannot endure the devil
 avaunt thou dreadful minister of hell
 thou hadst but power over his mortal body
 his soul thou canst not have therefore be gone
gloucester sweet saint for charity be not so curst
lady anne foul devil for god's sake hence and trouble us not
 for thou hast made the happy earth thy hell
 fill'd it with cursing cries and deep exclaims
 if thou delight to view thy heinous deeds
 behold this pattern of thy butcheries
 o gentlemen see see dead henry's wounds
 open their congeal'd mouths and bleed afresh
 blush blush thou lump of foul deformity
 for tis thy presence that exhales this blood
 from cold and empty veins where no blood dwells
 thy deed inhuman and unnatural
 provokes this deluge most unnatural
 o god which this blood madest revenge his death
 o earth which this blood drink'st revenge his death
 either heaven with lightning strike the
 murderer dead
 or earth gape open wide and eat him quick
 as thou dost swallow up this good king's blood
 which his hellgovern'd arm hath butchered
gloucester lady you know no rules of charity
 which renders good for bad blessings for curses
lady anne villain thou know'st no law of god nor man
 no beast so fierce but knows some touch of pity
gloucester but i know none and therefore am no beast
lady anne o wonderful when devils tell the truth
gloucester more wonderful when angels are so angry
 vouchsafe divine perfection of a woman
 of these supposedevils to give me leave
 by circumstance but to acquit myself
lady anne vouchsafe defused infection of a man
 for these known evils but to give me leave
 by circumstance to curse thy cursed self
gloucester fairer than tongue can name thee let me have
 some patient leisure to excuse myself
lady anne fouler than heart can think thee thou canst make
 no excuse current but to hang thyself
gloucester by such despair i should accuse myself
lady anne and by despairing shouldst thou stand excused
 for doing worthy vengeance on thyself
 which didst unworthy slaughter upon others
gloucester say that i slew them not
lady anne why then they are not dead
 but dead they are and devilish slave by thee
gloucester i did not kill your husband
lady anne why then he is alive
gloucester nay he is dead and slain by edward's hand
lady anne in thy foul throat thou liest queen margaret saw
 thy murderous falchion smoking in his blood
 the which thou once didst bend against her breast
 but that thy brothers beat aside the point
gloucester i was provoked by her slanderous tongue
 which laid their guilt upon my guiltless shoulders
lady anne thou wast provoked by thy bloody mind
 which never dreamt on aught but butcheries
 didst thou not kill this king
gloucester i grant ye
lady anne dost grant me hedgehog then god grant me too
 thou mayst be damned for that wicked deed
 o he was gentle mild and virtuous
gloucester the fitter for the king of heaven that hath him
lady anne he is in heaven where thou shalt never come
gloucester let him thank me that holp to send him thither
 for he was fitter for that place than earth
lady anne and thou unfit for any place but hell
gloucester yes one place else if you will hear me name it
lady anne some dungeon
gloucester your bedchamber
lady anne i'll rest betide the chamber where thou liest
gloucester so will it madam till i lie with you
lady anne i hope so
gloucester i know so but gentle lady anne
 to leave this keen encounter of our wits
 and fall somewhat into a slower method
 is not the causer of the timeless deaths
 of these plantagenets henry and edward
 as blameful as the executioner
lady anne thou art the cause and most accursed effect
gloucester your beauty was the cause of that effect
 your beauty which did haunt me in my sleep
 to undertake the death of all the world
 so i might live one hour in your sweet bosom
lady anne if i thought that i tell thee homicide
 these nails should rend that beauty from my cheeks
gloucester these eyes could never endure sweet beauty's wreck
 you should not blemish it if i stood by
 as all the world is cheered by the sun
 so i by that it is my day my life
lady anne black night o'ershade thy day and death thy life
gloucester curse not thyself fair creature thou art both
lady anne i would i were to be revenged on thee
gloucester it is a quarrel most unnatural
 to be revenged on him that loveth you
lady anne it is a quarrel just and reasonable
 to be revenged on him that slew my husband
gloucester he that bereft thee lady of thy husband
 did it to help thee to a better husband
lady anne his better doth not breathe upon the earth
gloucester he lives that loves thee better than he could
lady anne name him
gloucester plantagenet
lady anne why that was he
gloucester the selfsame name but one of better nature
lady anne where is he
gloucester here
 she spitteth at him
 why dost thou spit at me
lady anne would it were mortal poison for thy sake
gloucester never came poison from so sweet a place
lady anne never hung poison on a fouler toad
 out of my sight thou dost infect my eyes
gloucester thine eyes sweet lady have infected mine
lady anne would they were basilisks to strike thee dead
gloucester i would they were that i might die at once
 for now they kill me with a living death
 those eyes of thine from mine have drawn salt tears
 shamed their aspect with store of childish drops
 these eyes that never shed remorseful tear
 no when my father york and edward wept
 to hear the piteous moan that rutland made
 when blackfaced clifford shook his sword at him
 nor when thy warlike father like a child
 told the sad story of my father's death
 and twenty times made pause to sob and weep
 that all the standersby had wet their cheeks
 like trees bedash'd with rain in that sad time
 my manly eyes did scorn an humble tear
 and what these sorrows could not thence exhale
 thy beauty hath and made them blind with weeping
 i never sued to friend nor enemy
 my tongue could never learn sweet smoothing word
 but now thy beauty is proposed my fee
 my proud heart sues and prompts my tongue to speak
 she looks scornfully at him
 teach not thy lips such scorn for they were made
 for kissing lady not for such contempt
 if thy revengeful heart cannot forgive
 lo here i lend thee this sharppointed sword
 which if thou please to hide in this true bosom
 and let the soul forth that adoreth thee
 i lay it naked to the deadly stroke
 and humbly beg the death upon my knee
 he lays his breast open she offers at it with his sword
 nay do not pause for i did kill king henry
 but twas thy beauty that provoked me
 nay now dispatch twas i that stabb'd young edward
 but twas thy heavenly face that set me on
 here she lets fall the sword
 take up the sword again or take up me
lady anne arise dissembler though i wish thy death
 i will not be the executioner
gloucester then bid me kill myself and i will do it
lady anne i have already
gloucester tush that was in thy rage
 speak it again and even with the word
 that hand which for thy love did kill thy love
 shall for thy love kill a far truer love
 to both their deaths thou shalt be accessary
lady anne i would i knew thy heart
gloucester tis figured in my tongue
lady anne i fear me both are false
gloucester then never man was true
lady anne well well put up your sword
gloucester say then my peace is made
lady anne that shall you know hereafter
gloucester but shall i live in hope
lady anne all men i hope live so
gloucester vouchsafe to wear this ring
lady anne to take is not to give
gloucester look how this ring encompasseth finger
 even so thy breast encloseth my poor heart
 wear both of them for both of them are thine
 and if thy poor devoted suppliant may
 but beg one favour at thy gracious hand
