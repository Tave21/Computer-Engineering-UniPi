 exit
cressida will you walk in my lord
troilus o cressida how often have i wished me thus
cressida wished my lord the gods granto my lord
troilus what should they grant what makes this pretty
 abruption what too curious dreg espies my sweet
 lady in the fountain of our love
cressida more dregs than water if my fears have eyes
troilus fears make devils of cherubims they never see truly
cressida blind fear that seeing reason leads finds safer
 footing than blind reason stumbling without fear to
 fear the worst oft cures the worse
troilus o let my lady apprehend no fear in all cupid's
 pageant there is presented no monster
cressida nor nothing monstrous neither
troilus nothing but our undertakings when we vow to weep
 seas live in fire eat rocks tame tigers thinking
 it harder for our mistress to devise imposition
 enough than for us to undergo any difficulty imposed
 this is the monstruosity in love lady that the will
 is infinite and the execution confined that the
 desire is boundless and the act a slave to limit
cressida they say all lovers swear more performance than they
 are able and yet reserve an ability that they never
 perform vowing more than the perfection of ten and
 discharging less than the tenth part of one they
 that have the voice of lions and the act of hares
 are they not monsters
troilus are there such such are not we praise us as we
 are tasted allow us as we prove our head shall go
 bare till merit crown it no perfection in reversion
 shall have a praise in present we will not name
 desert before his birth and being born his addition
 shall be humble few words to fair faith troilus
 shall be such to cressid as what envy can say worst
 shall be a mock for his truth and what truth can
 speak truest not truer than troilus
cressida will you walk in my lord
 reenter pandarus
pandarus what blushing still have you not done talking yet
cressida well uncle what folly i commit i dedicate to you
pandarus i thank you for that if my lord get a boy of you
 you'll give him me be true to my lord if he
 flinch chide me for it
troilus you know now your hostages your uncle's word and my
 firm faith
pandarus nay i'll give my word for her too our kindred
 though they be long ere they are wooed they are
 constant being won they are burs i can tell you
 they'll stick where they are thrown
cressida boldness comes to me now and brings me heart
 prince troilus i have loved you night and day
 for many weary months
troilus why was my cressid then so hard to win
cressida hard to seem won but i was won my lord
 with the first glance that everpardon me
 if i confess much you will play the tyrant
 i love you now but not till now so much
 but i might master it in faith i lie
 my thoughts were like unbridled children grown
 too headstrong for their mother see we fools
 why have i blabb'd who shall be true to us
 when we are so unsecret to ourselves
 but though i loved you well i woo'd you not
 and yet good faith i wish'd myself a man
 or that we women had men's privilege
 of speaking first sweet bid me hold my tongue
 for in this rapture i shall surely speak
 the thing i shall repent see see your silence
 cunning in dumbness from my weakness draws
 my very soul of counsel stop my mouth
troilus and shall albeit sweet music issues thence
pandarus pretty i faith
cressida my lord i do beseech you pardon me
 twas not my purpose thus to beg a kiss
 i am ashamed o heavens what have i done
 for this time will i take my leave my lord
troilus your leave sweet cressid
pandarus leave an you take leave till tomorrow morning
cressida pray you content you
troilus what offends you lady
cressida sir mine own company
troilus you cannot shun yourself
cressida let me go and try
 i have a kind of self resides with you
 but an unkind self that itself will leave
 to be another's fool i would be gone
 where is my wit i know not what i speak
troilus well know they what they speak that speak so wisely
cressida perchance my lord i show more craft than love
 and fell so roundly to a large confession
 to angle for your thoughts but you are wise
 or else you love not for to be wise and love
 exceeds man's might that dwells with gods above
troilus o that i thought it could be in a woman
 as if it can i will presume in you
 to feed for aye her ramp and flames of love
 to keep her constancy in plight and youth
 outliving beauty's outward with a mind
 that doth renew swifter than blood decays
 or that persuasion could but thus convince me
 that my integrity and truth to you
 might be affronted with the match and weight
 of such a winnow'd purity in love
 how were i then uplifted but alas
 i am as true as truth's simplicity
 and simpler than the infancy of truth
cressida in that i'll war with you
troilus o virtuous fight
 when right with right wars who shall be most right
 true swains in love shall in the world to come
 approve their truths by troilus when their rhymes
 full of protest of oath and big compare
 want similes truth tired with iteration
 as true as steel as plantage to the moon
 as sun to day as turtle to her mate
 as iron to adamant as earth to the centre
 yet after all comparisons of truth
 as truth's authentic author to be cited
 as true as troilus shall crown up the verse
 and sanctify the numbers
cressida prophet may you be
 if i be false or swerve a hair from truth
 when time is old and hath forgot itself
 when waterdrops have worn the stones of troy
 and blind oblivion swallow'd cities up
 and mighty states characterless are grated
 to dusty nothing yet let memory
 from false to false among false maids in love
 upbraid my falsehood when they've said as false
 as air as water wind or sandy earth
 as fox to lamb as wolf to heifer's calf
 pard to the hind or stepdame to her son'
 yea let them say to stick the heart of falsehood
 as false as cressid'
pandarus go to a bargain made seal it seal it i'll be the
 witness here i hold your hand here my cousin's
 if ever you prove false one to another since i have
 taken such pains to bring you together let all
 pitiful goersbetween be called to the world's end
 after my name call them all pandars let all
 constant men be troiluses all false women cressids
 and all brokersbetween pandars say amen
troilus amen
cressida amen
pandarus amen whereupon i will show you a chamber with a
 bed which bed because it shall not speak of your
 pretty encounters press it to death away
 and cupid grant all tonguetied maidens here
 bed chamber pandar to provide this gear

act iii
scene iii the grecian camp before achilles tent
 enter agamemnon ulysses diomedes nestor ajax
 menelaus and calchas
calchas now princes for the service i have done you
 the advantage of the time prompts me aloud
 to call for recompense appear it to your mind
 that through the sight i bear in things to love
 i have abandon'd troy left my possession
 incurr'd a traitor's name exposed myself
 from certain and possess'd conveniences
 to doubtful fortunes sequestering from me all
 that time acquaintance custom and condition
 made tame and most familiar to my nature
 and here to do you service am become
 as new into the world strange unacquainted
 i do beseech you as in way of taste
 to give me now a little benefit
 out of those many register'd in promise
 which you say live to come in my behalf
agamemnon what wouldst thou of us trojan make demand
calchas you have a trojan prisoner call'd antenor
 yesterday took troy holds him very dear
 oft have youoften have you thanks therefore
 desired my cressid in right great exchange
 whom troy hath still denied but this antenor
 i know is such a wrest in their affairs
 that their negotiations all must slack
 wanting his manage and they will almost
 give us a prince of blood a son of priam
 in change of him let him be sent great princes
 and he shall buy my daughter and her presence
 shall quite strike off all service i have done
 in most accepted pain
agamemnon let diomedes bear him
 and bring us cressid hither calchas shall have
 what he requests of us good diomed
 furnish you fairly for this interchange
 withal bring word if hector will tomorrow
 be answer'd in his challenge ajax is ready
diomedes this shall i undertake and tis a burden
 which i am proud to bear
 exeunt diomedes and calchas
 enter achilles and patroclus before their tent
ulysses achilles stands i the entrance of his tent
 please it our general to pass strangely by him
 as if he were forgot and princes all
 lay negligent and loose regard upon him
