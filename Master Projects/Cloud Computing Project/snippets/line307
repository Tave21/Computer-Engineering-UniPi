 with certain halfcaps and coldmoving nods
 they froze me into silence
timon you gods reward them
 prithee man look cheerly these old fellows
 have their ingratitude in them hereditary
 their blood is caked tis cold it seldom flows
 tis lack of kindly warmth they are not kind
 and nature as it grows again toward earth
 is fashion'd for the journey dull and heavy
 to a servant
 go to ventidius
 to flavius
 prithee be not sad
 thou art true and honest ingeniously i speak
 no blame belongs to thee
 to servant
 ventidius lately
 buried his father by whose death he's stepp'd
 into a great estate when he was poor
 imprison'd and in scarcity of friends
 i clear'd him with five talents greet him from me
 bid him suppose some good necessity
 touches his friend which craves to be remember'd
 with those five talents
 exit servant
 to flavius
 that had give't these fellows
 to whom tis instant due ne'er speak or think
 that timon's fortunes mong his friends can sink
flavius i would i could not think it that thought is
 bounty's foe
 being free itself it thinks all others so

flaminius i thank you sir

lucullus aside one of lord timon's men a gift i

 basin and ewer tonight flaminius honest
 flaminius you are very respectively welcome sir

 exit servants
 and how does that honourable complete freehearted
 gentleman of athens thy very bountiful good lord
 and master
flaminius his health is well sir
lucullus i am right glad that his health is well sir and
 what hast thou there under thy cloak pretty flaminius
flaminius faith nothing but an empty box sir which in my
 lord's behalf i come to entreat your honour to
 supply who having great and instant occasion to
 use fifty talents hath sent to your lordship to
 furnish him nothing doubting your present
 assistance therein
lucullus la la la la nothing doubting says he alas
 good lord a noble gentleman tis if he would not
 keep so good a house many a time and often i ha'
 dined with him and told him on't and come again to
 supper to him of purpose to have him spend less
 and yet he would embrace no counsel take no warning
 by my coming every man has his fault and honesty
 is his i ha told him on't but i could ne'er get
 him from't
 reenter servant with wine
servant please your lordship here is the wine
lucullus flaminius i have noted thee always wise here's to thee
flaminius your lordship speaks your pleasure
lucullus i have observed thee always for a towardly prompt
 spiritgive thee thy dueand one that knows what
 belongs to reason and canst use the time well if
 the time use thee well good parts in thee
 to servant
 get you gone sirrah
 exit servant
 draw nearer honest flaminius thy lord's a
 bountiful gentleman but thou art wise and thou
 knowest well enough although thou comest to me
 that this is no time to lend money especially upon
 bare friendship without security here's three
 solidares for thee good boy wink at me and say
 thou sawest me not fare thee well
flaminius is't possible the world should so much differ
 and we alive that lived fly damned baseness
 to him that worships thee
 throwing the money back
lucullus ha now i see thou art a fool and fit for thy master
 exit
flaminius may these add to the number that may scald thee
 let moulten coin be thy damnation
 thou disease of a friend and not himself
 has friendship such a faint and milky heart
 it turns in less than two nights o you gods
 i feel master's passion this slave
 unto his honour has my lord's meat in him
 why should it thrive and turn to nutriment
 when he is turn'd to poison
 o may diseases only work upon't
 and when he's sick to death let not that part of nature
 which my lord paid for be of any power
 to expel sickness but prolong his hour
 exit
 timon of athens
act iii
scene ii a public place
 enter lucilius with three strangers
lucilius who the lord timon he is my very good friend and
 an honourable gentleman
first stranger we know him for no less though we are but strangers
 to him but i can tell you one thing my lord and
 which i hear from common rumours now lord timon's
 happy hours are done and past and his estate
 shrinks from him
lucilius fie no do not believe it he cannot want for money
second stranger but believe you this my lord that not long ago
 one of his men was with the lord lucullus to borrow
 so many talents nay urged extremely for't and
 showed what necessity belonged to't and yet was denied
lucilius how
second stranger i tell you denied my lord
lucilius what a strange case was that now before the gods
 i am ashamed on't denied that honourable man
 there was very little honour showed in't for my own
 part i must needs confess i have received some
 small kindnesses from him as money plate jewels
 and suchlike trifles nothing comparing to his
 yet had he mistook him and sent to me i should
 ne'er have denied his occasion so many talents
 enter servilius
servilius see by good hap yonder's my lord
 i have sweat to see his honour my honoured lord
 to lucius
lucilius servilius you are kindly met sir fare thee well
 commend me to thy honourable virtuous lord my very
 exquisite friend
servilius may it please your honour my lord hath sent
lucilius ha what has he sent i am so much endeared to
 that lord he's ever sending how shall i thank
 him thinkest thou and what has he sent now
servilius has only sent his present occasion now my lord
 requesting your lordship to supply his instant use
 with so many talents
lucilius i know his lordship is but merry with me
 he cannot want fifty five hundred talents
servilius but in the mean time he wants less my lord
 if his occasion were not virtuous
 i should not urge it half so faithfully
lucilius dost thou speak seriously servilius
servilius upon my soul'tis true sir
lucilius what a wicked beast was i to disfurnish myself
 against such a good time when i might ha shown
 myself honourable how unluckily it happened that i
 should purchase the day before for a little part
 and undo a great deal of honoured servilius now
 before the gods i am not able to dothe more
 beast i sayi was sending to use lord timon
 myself these gentlemen can witness but i would
 not for the wealth of athens i had done't now
 commend me bountifully to his good lordship and i
 hope his honour will conceive the fairest of me
 because i have no power to be kind and tell him
 this from me i count it one of my greatest
 afflictions say that i cannot pleasure such an
 honourable gentleman good servilius will you
 befriend me so far as to use mine own words to him
servilius yes sir i shall
lucilius i'll look you out a good turn servilius
 exit servilius
 true as you said timon is shrunk indeed
 and he that's once denied will hardly speed
 exit
first stranger do you observe this hostilius
second stranger ay too well
first stranger why this is the world's soul and just of the
 same piece
 is every flatterer's spirit who can call him
 his friend that dips in the same dish for in
 my knowing timon has been this lord's father
 and kept his credit with his purse
 supported his estate nay timon's money
 has paid his men their wages he ne'er drinks
 but timon's silver treads upon his lip
 and yeto see the monstrousness of man
 when he looks out in an ungrateful shape
 he does deny him in respect of his
 what charitable men afford to beggars
third stranger religion groans at it
first stranger for mine own part
 i never tasted timon in my life
 nor came any of his bounties over me
 to mark me for his friend yet i protest
 for his right noble mind illustrious virtue
 and honourable carriage
 had his necessity made use of me
 i would have put my wealth into donation
 and the best half should have return'd to him
