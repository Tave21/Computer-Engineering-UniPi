and the chief priests and the scribes the same hour sought to lay hands on him and they feared the people for they perceived that he had spoken this parable against them
and they watched him and sent forth spies which should feign themselves just men that they might take hold of his words that so they might deliver him unto the power and authority of the governor
and they asked him saying master we know that thou sayest and teachest rightly neither acceptest thou the person of any but teachest the way of god truly
is it lawful for us to give tribute unto caesar or no
but he perceived their craftiness and said unto them why tempt ye me
shew me a penny whose image and superscription hath it they answered and said caesar's
and he said unto them render therefore unto caesar the things which be caesar's and unto god the things which be god's
and they could not take hold of his words before the people and they marvelled at his answer and held their peace
then came to him certain of the sadducees which deny that there is any resurrection and they asked him
saying master moses wrote unto us if any man's brother die having a wife and he die without children that his brother should take his wife and raise up seed unto his brother
there were therefore seven brethren and the first took a wife and died without children
and the second took her to wife and he died childless
and the third took her and in like manner the seven also and they left no children and died
last of all the woman died also
therefore in the resurrection whose wife of them is she for seven had her to wife
and jesus answering said unto them the children of this world marry and are given in marriage
but they which shall be accounted worthy to obtain that world and the resurrection from the dead neither marry nor are given in marriage
neither can they die any more for they are equal unto the angels and are the children of god being the children of the resurrection
now that the dead are raised even moses shewed at the bush when he calleth the lord the god of abraham and the god of isaac and the god of jacob
for he is not a god of the dead but of the living for all live unto him
then certain of the scribes answering said master thou hast well said
and after that they durst not ask him any question at all
and he said unto them how say they that christ is david's son
and david himself saith in the book of psalms the lord said unto my lord sit thou on my right hand
till i make thine enemies thy footstool
david therefore calleth him lord how is he then his son
then in the audience of all the people he said unto his disciples
beware of the scribes which desire to walk in long robes and love greetings in the markets and the highest seats in the synagogues and the chief rooms at feasts
which devour widows houses and for a shew make long prayers the same shall receive greater damnation
and he looked up and saw the rich men casting their gifts into the treasury
and he saw also a certain poor widow casting in thither two mites
and he said of a truth i say unto you that this poor widow hath cast in more than they all
for all these have of their abundance cast in unto the offerings of god but she of her penury hath cast in all the living that she had
and as some spake of the temple how it was adorned with goodly stones and gifts he said
as for these things which ye behold the days will come in the which there shall not be left one stone upon another that shall not be thrown down
and they asked him saying master but when shall these things be and what sign will there be when these things shall come to pass
and he said take heed that ye be not deceived for many shall come in my name saying i am christ and the time draweth near go ye not therefore after them
but when ye shall hear of wars and commotions be not terrified for these things must first come to pass but the end is not by and by
then said he unto them nation shall rise against nation and kingdom against kingdom
and great earthquakes shall be in divers places and famines and pestilences and fearful sights and great signs shall there be from heaven
but before all these they shall lay their hands on you and persecute you delivering you up to the synagogues and into prisons being brought before kings and rulers for my name's sake
and it shall turn to you for a testimony
settle it therefore in your hearts not to meditate before what ye shall answer
for i will give you a mouth and wisdom which all your adversaries shall not be able to gainsay nor resist
and ye shall be betrayed both by parents and brethren and kinsfolks and friends and some of you shall they cause to be put to death
and ye shall be hated of all men for my name's sake
but there shall not an hair of your head perish
in your patience possess ye your souls
and when ye shall see jerusalem compassed with armies then know that the desolation thereof is nigh
then let them which are in judaea flee to the mountains and let them which are in the midst of it depart out and let not them that are in the countries enter thereinto
for these be the days of vengeance that all things which are written may be fulfilled
but woe unto them that are with child and to them that give suck in those days for there shall be great distress in the land and wrath upon this people
and they shall fall by the edge of the sword and shall be led away captive into all nations and jerusalem shall be trodden down of the gentiles until the times of the gentiles be fulfilled
and there shall be signs in the sun and in the moon and in the stars and upon the earth distress of nations with perplexity the sea and the waves roaring
men's hearts failing them for fear and for looking after those things which are coming on the earth for the powers of heaven shall be shaken
and then shall they see the son of man coming in a cloud with power and great glory
and when these things begin to come to pass then look up and lift up your heads for your redemption draweth nigh
and he spake to them a parable behold the fig tree and all the trees
when they now shoot forth ye see and know of your own selves that summer is now nigh at hand
so likewise ye when ye see these things come to pass know ye that the kingdom of god is nigh at hand
verily i say unto you this generation shall not pass away till all be fulfilled
heaven and earth shall pass away but my words shall not pass away
and take heed to yourselves lest at any time your hearts be overcharged with surfeiting and drunkenness and cares of this life and so that day come upon you unawares
for as a snare shall it come on all them that dwell on the face of the whole earth
watch ye therefore and pray always that ye may be accounted worthy to escape all these things that shall come to pass and to stand before the son of man
and in the day time he was teaching in the temple and at night he went out and abode in the mount that is called the mount of olives
and all the people came early in the morning to him in the temple for to hear him
now the feast of unleavened bread drew nigh which is called the passover
and the chief priests and scribes sought how they might kill him for they feared the people
then entered satan into judas surnamed iscariot being of the number of the twelve
and he went his way and communed with the chief priests and captains how he might betray him unto them
and they were glad and covenanted to give him money
and he promised and sought opportunity to betray him unto them in the absence of the multitude
then came the day of unleavened bread when the passover must be killed
and he sent peter and john saying go and prepare us the passover that we may eat
and they said unto him where wilt thou that we prepare
and he said unto them behold when ye are entered into the city there shall a man meet you bearing a pitcher of water follow him into the house where he entereth in
and ye shall say unto the goodman of the house the master saith unto thee where is the guestchamber where i shall eat the passover with my disciples
and he shall shew you a large upper room furnished there make ready
and they went and found as he had said unto them and they made ready the passover
and when the hour was come he sat down and the twelve apostles with him
and he said unto them with desire i have desired to eat this passover with you before i suffer
for i say unto you i will not any more eat thereof until it be fulfilled in the kingdom of god
and he took the cup and gave thanks and said take this and divide it among yourselves
for i say unto you i will not drink of the fruit of the vine until the kingdom of god shall come
and he took bread and gave thanks and brake it and gave unto them saying this is my body which is given for you this do in remembrance of me
likewise also the cup after supper saying this cup is the new testament in my blood which is shed for you
but behold the hand of him that betrayeth me is with me on the table
and truly the son of man goeth as it was determined but woe unto that man by whom he is betrayed
and they began to enquire among themselves which of them it was that should do this thing
and there was also a strife among them which of them should be accounted the greatest
and he said unto them the kings of the gentiles exercise lordship over them and they that exercise authority upon them are called benefactors
but ye shall not be so but he that is greatest among you let him be as the younger and he that is chief as he that doth serve
for whether is greater he that sitteth at meat or he that serveth is not he that sitteth at meat but i am among you as he that serveth
ye are they which have continued with me in my temptations
and i appoint unto you a kingdom as my father hath appointed unto me
that ye may eat and drink at my table in my kingdom and sit on thrones judging the twelve tribes of israel
and the lord said simon simon behold satan hath desired to have you that he may sift you as wheat
but i have prayed for thee that thy faith fail not and when thou art converted strengthen thy brethren
and he said unto him lord i am ready to go with thee both into prison and to death
and he said i tell thee peter the cock shall not crow this day before that thou shalt thrice deny that thou knowest me
and he said unto them when i sent you without purse and scrip and shoes lacked ye any thing and they said nothing
then said he unto them but now he that hath a purse let him take it and likewise his scrip and he that hath no sword let him sell his garment and buy one
for i say unto you that this that is written must yet be accomplished in me and he was reckoned among the transgressors for the things concerning me have an end
and they said lord behold here are two swords and he said unto them it is enough
and he came out and went as he was wont to the mount of olives and his disciples also followed him
and when he was at the place he said unto them pray that ye enter not into temptation
and he was withdrawn from them about a stone's cast and kneeled down and prayed
saying father if thou be willing remove this cup from me nevertheless not my will but thine be done
and there appeared an angel unto him from heaven strengthening him
and being in an agony he prayed more earnestly and his sweat was as it were great drops of blood falling down to the ground
and when he rose up from prayer and was come to his disciples he found them sleeping for sorrow
and said unto them why sleep ye rise and pray lest ye enter into temptation
and while he yet spake behold a multitude and he that was called judas one of the twelve went before them and drew near unto jesus to kiss him
but jesus said unto him judas betrayest thou the son of man with a kiss
when they which were about him saw what would follow they said unto him lord shall we smite with the sword
and one of them smote the servant of the high priest and cut off his right ear
and jesus answered and said suffer ye thus far and he touched his ear and healed him
then jesus said unto the chief priests and captains of the temple and the elders which were come to him be ye come out as against a thief with swords and staves
when i was daily with you in the temple ye stretched forth no hands against me but this is your hour and the power of darkness
then took they him and led him and brought him into the high priest's house and peter followed afar off
and when they had kindled a fire in the midst of the hall and were set down together peter sat down among them
but a certain maid beheld him as he sat by the fire and earnestly looked upon him and said this man was also with him
and he denied him saying woman i know him not
and after a little while another saw him and said thou art also of them and peter said man i am not
and about the space of one hour after another confidently affirmed saying of a truth this fellow also was with him for he is a galilaean
and peter said man i know not what thou sayest and immediately while he yet spake the cock crew
and the lord turned and looked upon peter and peter remembered the word of the lord how he had said unto him before the cock crow thou shalt deny me thrice
and peter went out and wept bitterly
and the men that held jesus mocked him and smote him
and when they had blindfolded him they struck him on the face and asked him saying prophesy who is it that smote thee
and many other things blasphemously spake they against him
and as soon as it was day the elders of the people and the chief priests and the scribes came together and led him into their council saying
art thou the christ tell us and he said unto them if i tell you ye will not believe
and if i also ask you ye will not answer me nor let me go
hereafter shall the son of man sit on the right hand of the power of god
then said they all art thou then the son of god and he said unto them ye say that i am
and they said what need we any further witness for we ourselves have heard of his own mouth
and the whole multitude of them arose and led him unto pilate
and they began to accuse him saying we found this fellow perverting the nation and forbidding to give tribute to caesar saying that he himself is christ a king
and pilate asked him saying art thou the king of the jews and he answered him and said thou sayest it
then said pilate to the chief priests and to the people i find no fault in this man
and they were the more fierce saying he stirreth up the people teaching throughout all jewry beginning from galilee to this place
when pilate heard of galilee he asked whether the man were a galilaean
and as soon as he knew that he belonged unto herod's jurisdiction he sent him to herod who himself also was at jerusalem at that time
and when herod saw jesus he was exceeding glad for he was desirous to see him of a long season because he had heard many things of him and he hoped to have seen some miracle done by him
then he questioned with him in many words but he answered him nothing
and the chief priests and scribes stood and vehemently accused him
and herod with his men of war set him at nought and mocked him and arrayed him in a gorgeous robe and sent him again to pilate
and the same day pilate and herod were made friends together for before they were at enmity between themselves
and pilate when he had called together the chief priests and the rulers and the people
said unto them ye have brought this man unto me as one that perverteth the people and behold i having examined him before you have found no fault in this man touching those things whereof ye accuse him
no nor yet herod for i sent you to him and lo nothing worthy of death is done unto him
i will therefore chastise him and release him
for of necessity he must release one unto them at the feast
and they cried out all at once saying away with this man and release unto us barabbas
who for a certain sedition made in the city and for murder was cast into prison
pilate therefore willing to release jesus spake again to them
but they cried saying crucify him crucify him
and he said unto them the third time why what evil hath he done i have found no cause of death in him i will therefore chastise him and let him go
and they were instant with loud voices requiring that he might be crucified and the voices of them and of the chief priests prevailed
and pilate gave sentence that it should be as they required
and he released unto them him that for sedition and murder was cast into prison whom they had desired but he delivered jesus to their will
and as they led him away they laid hold upon one simon a cyrenian coming out of the country and on him they laid the cross that he might bear it after jesus
and there followed him a great company of people and of women which also bewailed and lamented him
but jesus turning unto them said daughters of jerusalem weep not for me but weep for yourselves and for your children
for behold the days are coming in the which they shall say blessed are the barren and the wombs that never bare and the paps which never gave suck
then shall they begin to say to the mountains fall on us and to the hills cover us
for if they do these things in a green tree what shall be done in the dry
and there were also two other malefactors led with him to be put to death
and when they were come to the place which is called calvary there they crucified him and the malefactors one on the right hand and the other on the left
then said jesus father forgive them for they know not what they do and they parted his raiment and cast lots
and the people stood beholding and the rulers also with them derided him saying he saved others let him save himself if he be christ the chosen of god
and the soldiers also mocked him coming to him and offering him vinegar
and saying if thou be the king of the jews save thyself
and a superscription also was written over him in letters of greek and latin and hebrew this is the king of the jews
and one of the malefactors which were hanged railed on him saying if thou be christ save thyself and us
but the other answering rebuked him saying dost not thou fear god seeing thou art in the same condemnation
and we indeed justly for we receive the due reward of our deeds but this man hath done nothing amiss
and he said unto jesus lord remember me when thou comest into thy kingdom
and jesus said unto him verily i say unto thee to day shalt thou be with me in paradise
and it was about the sixth hour and there was a darkness over all the earth until the ninth hour
and the sun was darkened and the veil of the temple was rent in the midst
and when jesus had cried with a loud voice he said father into thy hands i commend my spirit and having said thus he gave up the ghost
now when the centurion saw what was done he glorified god saying certainly this was a righteous man
and all the people that came together to that sight beholding the things which were done smote their breasts and returned
and all his acquaintance and the women that followed him from galilee stood afar off beholding these things
and behold there was a man named joseph a counsellor and he was a good man and a just
the same had not consented to the counsel and deed of them he was of arimathaea a city of the jews who also himself waited for the kingdom of god
this man went unto pilate and begged the body of jesus
and he took it down and wrapped it in linen and laid it in a sepulchre that was hewn in stone wherein never man before was laid
and that day was the preparation and the sabbath drew on
and the women also which came with him from galilee followed after and beheld the sepulchre and how his body was laid
and they returned and prepared spices and ointments and rested the sabbath day according to the commandment
now upon the first day of the week very early in the morning they came unto the sepulchre bringing the spices which they had prepared and certain others with them
and they found the stone rolled away from the sepulchre
and they entered in and found not the body of the lord jesus
and it came to pass as they were much perplexed thereabout behold two men stood by them in shining garments
and as they were afraid and bowed down their faces to the earth they said unto them why seek ye the living among the dead
he is not here but is risen remember how he spake unto you when he was yet in galilee
