 is not this true
dionyza our cheeks and hollow eyes do witness it
cleon o let those cities that of plenty's cup
 and her prosperities so largely taste
 with their superfluous riots hear these tears
 the misery of tarsus may be theirs
 enter a lord
lord where's the lord governor
cleon here
 speak out thy sorrows which thou bring'st in haste
 for comfort is too far for us to expect
lord we have descried upon our neighbouring shore
 a portly sail of ships make hitherward
cleon i thought as much
 one sorrow never comes but brings an heir
 that may succeed as his inheritor
 and so in ours some neighbouring nation
 taking advantage of our misery
 hath stuff'd these hollow vessels with their power
 to beat us down the which are down already
 and make a conquest of unhappy me
 whereas no glory's got to overcome
lord that's the least fear for by the semblance
 of their white flags display'd they bring us peace
 and come to us as favourers not as foes
cleon thou speak'st like him's untutor'd to repeat
 who makes the fairest show means most deceit
 but bring they what they will and what they can
 what need we fear
 the ground's the lowest and we are half way there
 go tell their general we attend him here
 to know for what he comes and whence he comes
 and what he craves
lord i go my lord
 exit
cleon welcome is peace if he on peace consist
 if wars we are unable to resist
 enter pericles with attendants
pericles lord governor for so we hear you are
 let not our ships and number of our men
 be like a beacon fired to amaze your eyes
 we have heard your miseries as far as tyre
 and seen the desolation of your streets
 nor come we to add sorrow to your tears
 but to relieve them of their heavy load
 and these our ships you happily may think
 are like the trojan horse was stuff'd within
 with bloody veins expecting overthrow
 are stored with corn to make your needy bread
 and give them life whom hunger starved half dead
all the gods of greece protect you
 and we'll pray for you
pericles arise i pray you rise
 we do not look for reverence but to love
 and harbourage for ourself our ships and men
cleon the which when any shall not gratify
 or pay you with unthankfulness in thought
 be it our wives our children or ourselves
 the curse of heaven and men succeed their evils
 till whenthe which i hope shall ne'er be seen
 your grace is welcome to our town and us
pericles which welcome we'll accept feast here awhile
 until our stars that frown lend us a smile

 enter gower
gower here have you seen a mighty king
 his child i wis to incest bring
 a better prince and benign lord
 that will prove awful both in deed and word
 be quiet then as men should be
 till he hath pass'd necessity
 i'll show you those in troubles reign
 losing a mite a mountain gain
 the good in conversation
 to whom i give my benison
 is still at tarsus where each man
 thinks all is writ he speken can
 and to remember what he does
 build his statue to make him glorious
 but tidings to the contrary
 are brought your eyes what need speak i
 dumb show
 enter at one door pericles talking with cleon all
 the train with them enter at another door a
 gentleman with a letter to pericles pericles
 shows the letter to cleon gives the messenger a
 reward and knights him exit pericles at one
 door and cleon at another
 good helicane that stay'd at home
 not to eat honey like a drone
 from others labours for though he strive
 to killen bad keep good alive
 and to fulfil his prince desire
 sends word of all that haps in tyre
 how thaliard came full bent with sin
 and had intent to murder him
 and that in tarsus was not best
 longer for him to make his rest
 he doing so put forth to seas
 where when men been there's seldom ease
 for now the wind begins to blow
 thunder above and deeps below
 make such unquiet that the ship
 should house him safe is wreck'd and split
 and he good prince having all lost
 by waves from coast to coast is tost
 all perishen of man of pelf
 ne aught escapen but himself
 till fortune tired with doing bad
 threw him ashore to give him glad
 and here he comes what shall be next

 pericles prince of tyre
act ii
scene i pentapolis an open place by the seaside
 enter pericles wet
pericles yet cease your ire you angry stars of heaven
 wind rain and thunder remember earthly man
 is but a substance that must yield to you
 and i as fits my nature do obey you
 alas the sea hath cast me on the rocks
 wash'd me from shore to shore and left me breath
 nothing to think on but ensuing death
 let it suffice the greatness of your powers
 to have bereft a prince of all his fortunes
 and having thrown him from your watery grave
 here to have death in peace is all he'll crave
 enter three fishermen
first fisherman what ho pilch
second fisherman ha come and bring away the nets
first fisherman what patchbreech i say
third fisherman what say you master
first fisherman look how thou stirrest now come away or i'll
 fetch thee with a wanion
third fisherman faith master i am thinking of the poor men that
 were cast away before us even now
first fisherman alas poor souls it grieved my heart to hear what
 pitiful cries they made to us to help them when
 welladay we could scarce help ourselves
third fisherman nay master said not i as much when i saw the
 porpus how he bounced and tumbled they say
 they're half fish half flesh a plague on them
 they ne'er come but i look to be washed master i
 marvel how the fishes live in the sea
first fisherman why as men do aland the great ones eat up the
 little ones i can compare our rich misers to
 nothing so fitly as to a whale a plays and
 tumbles driving the poor fry before him and at
 last devours them all at a mouthful such whales
 have i heard on o the land who never leave gaping
 till they've swallowed the whole parish church
 steeple bells and all
pericles aside a pretty moral
third fisherman but master if i had been the sexton i would have
 been that day in the belfry
second fisherman why man
third fisherman because he should have swallowed me too and when i
 had been in his belly i would have kept such a
 jangling of the bells that he should never have
 left till he cast bells steeple church and
 parish up again but if the good king simonides
 were of my mind
pericles aside simonides
third fisherman we would purge the land of these drones that rob
 the bee of her honey
pericles aside how from the finny subject of the sea
 these fishers tell the infirmities of men
 and from their watery empire recollect
 all that may men approve or men detect
 peace be at your labour honest fishermen
second fisherman honest good fellow what's that if it be a day
 fits you search out of the calendar and nobody
 look after it
pericles may see the sea hath cast upon your coast
second fisherman what a drunken knave was the sea to cast thee in our
 way
pericles a man whom both the waters and the wind
 in that vast tenniscourt have made the ball
 for them to play upon entreats you pity him
 he asks of you that never used to beg
first fisherman no friend cannot you beg here's them in our
 country greece gets more with begging than we can do
 with working
second fisherman canst thou catch any fishes then
pericles i never practised it
second fisherman nay then thou wilt starve sure for here's nothing
 to be got nowadays unless thou canst fish for't
pericles what i have been i have forgot to know
 but what i am want teaches me to think on
 a man throng'd up with cold my veins are chill
 and have no more of life than may suffice
 to give my tongue that heat to ask your help
 which if you shall refuse when i am dead
 for that i am a man pray see me buried
first fisherman die quotha now gods forbid i have a gown here
 come put it on keep thee warm now afore me a
 handsome fellow come thou shalt go home and
