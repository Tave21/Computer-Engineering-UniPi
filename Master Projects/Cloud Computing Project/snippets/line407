scene i britain before cymbeline's palace
 enter cloten and two lords
cloten was there ever man had such luck when i kissed the
 jack upon an upcast to be hit away i had a
 hundred pound on't and then a whoreson jackanapes
 must take me up for swearing as if i borrowed mine
 oaths of him and might not spend them at my pleasure
first lord what got he by that you have broke his pate with
 your bowl
second lord aside if his wit had been like him that broke it
 it would have run all out
cloten when a gentleman is disposed to swear it is not for
 any standersby to curtail his oaths ha
second lord no my lord
 aside
 nor crop the ears of them
cloten whoreson dog i give him satisfaction
 would he had been one of my rank
second lord aside to have smelt like a fool
cloten i am not vexed more at any thing in the earth a
 pox on't i had rather not be so noble as i am
 they dare not fight with me because of the queen my
 mother every jackslave hath his bellyful of
 fighting and i must go up and down like a cock that
 nobody can match
second lord aside you are cock and capon too and you crow
 cock with your comb on
cloten sayest thou
second lord it is not fit your lordship should undertake every
 companion that you give offence to
cloten no i know that but it is fit i should commit
 offence to my inferiors
second lord ay it is fit for your lordship only
cloten why so i say
first lord did you hear of a stranger that's come to court tonight
cloten a stranger and i not know on't
second lord aside he's a strange fellow himself and knows it
 not
first lord there's an italian come and tis thought one of
 leonatus friends
cloten leonatus a banished rascal and he's another
 whatsoever he be who told you of this stranger
first lord one of your lordship's pages
cloten is it fit i went to look upon him is there no
 derogation in't
second lord you cannot derogate my lord
cloten not easily i think
second lord aside you are a fool granted therefore your
 issues being foolish do not derogate
cloten come i'll go see this italian what i have lost
 today at bowls i'll win tonight of him come go
second lord i'll attend your lordship
 exeunt cloten and first lord
 that such a crafty devil as is his mother
 should yield the world this ass a woman that
 bears all down with her brain and this her son
 cannot take two from twenty for his heart
 and leave eighteen alas poor princess
 thou divine imogen what thou endurest
 betwixt a father by thy stepdame govern'd
 a mother hourly coining plots a wooer
 more hateful than the foul expulsion is
 of thy dear husband than that horrid act
 of the divorce he'ld make the heavens hold firm
 the walls of thy dear honour keep unshaked
 that temple thy fair mind that thou mayst stand
 to enjoy thy banish'd lord and this great land

 cymbeline
act ii
scene ii imogen's bedchamber in cymbeline's palace
 a trunk in one corner of it
 imogen in bed reading a lady attending
imogen who's there my woman helen
lady please you madam
imogen what hour is it
lady almost midnight madam
imogen i have read three hours then mine eyes are weak
 fold down the leaf where i have left to bed
 take not away the taper leave it burning
 and if thou canst awake by four o the clock
 i prithee call me sleep hath seized me wholly
 exit lady
 to your protection i commend me gods
 from fairies and the tempters of the night
 guard me beseech ye
 sleeps iachimo comes from the trunk
iachimo the crickets sing and man's o'erlabour'd sense
 repairs itself by rest our tarquin thus
 did softly press the rushes ere he waken'd
 the chastity he wounded cytherea
 how bravely thou becomest thy bed fresh lily
 and whiter than the sheets that i might touch
 but kiss one kiss rubies unparagon'd
 how dearly they do't tis her breathing that
 perfumes the chamber thus the flame o the taper
 bows toward her and would underpeep her lids
 to see the enclosed lights now canopied
 under these windows white and azure laced
 with blue of heaven's own tinct but my design
 to note the chamber i will write all down
 such and such pictures there the window such
 the adornment of her bed the arras figures
 why such and such and the contents o the story
 ah but some natural notes about her body
 above ten thousand meaner moveables
 would testify to enrich mine inventory
 o sleep thou ape of death lie dull upon her
 and be her sense but as a monument
 thus in a chapel lying come off come off
 taking off her bracelet
 as slippery as the gordian knot was hard
 tis mine and this will witness outwardly
 as strongly as the conscience does within
 to the madding of her lord on her left breast
 a mole cinquespotted like the crimson drops
 i the bottom of a cowslip here's a voucher
 stronger than ever law could make this secret
 will force him think i have pick'd the lock and ta'en
 the treasure of her honour no more to what end
 why should i write this down that's riveted
 screw'd to my memory she hath been reading late
 the tale of tereus here the leaf's turn'd down
 where philomel gave up i have enough
 to the trunk again and shut the spring of it
 swift swift you dragons of the night that dawning
 may bare the raven's eye i lodge in fear
 though this a heavenly angel hell is here
 clock strikes
 one two three time time
 goes into the trunk the scene closes
 cymbeline
act ii
scene iii an antechamber adjoining imogen's apartments
 enter cloten and lords
first lord your lordship is the most patient man in loss the
 most coldest that ever turned up ace
cloten it would make any man cold to lose
first lord but not every man patient after the noble temper of
 your lordship you are most hot and furious when you win
cloten winning will put any man into courage if i could
 get this foolish imogen i should have gold enough
 it's almost morning is't not
first lord day my lord
cloten i would this music would come i am advised to give
 her music o mornings they say it will penetrate
 enter musicians
 come on tune if you can penetrate her with your
 fingering so we'll try with tongue too if none
 will do let her remain but i'll never give o'er
