clown do you not hear fellows take away the lady
olivia go to you're a dry fool i'll no more of you
 besides you grow dishonest
clown two faults madonna that drink and good counsel
 will amend for give the dry fool drink then is
 the fool not dry bid the dishonest man mend
 himself if he mend he is no longer dishonest if
 he cannot let the botcher mend him any thing
 that's mended is but patched virtue that
 transgresses is but patched with sin and sin that
 amends is but patched with virtue if that this
 simple syllogism will serve so if it will not
 what remedy as there is no true cuckold but
 calamity so beauty's a flower the lady bade take
 away the fool therefore i say again take her away

 better increasing your folly sir toby will be
 sworn that i am no fox but he will not pass his
 word for two pence that you are no fool

 barren rascal i saw him put down the other day
 with an ordinary fool that has no more brain

 already unless you laugh and minister occasion to
 him he is gagged i protest i take these wise men
 that crow so at these set kind of fools no better
 than the fools zanies

 with a distempered appetite to be generous
 guiltless and of free disposition is to take those
 things for birdbolts that you deem cannonbullets

 nothing but rail nor no railing in a known discreet
 man though he do nothing but reprove

 penned i have taken great pains to con it good

 comptible even to the least sinister usage

 question's out of my part good gentle one give me
 modest assurance if you be the lady of the house

 of malice i swear i am not that i play are you
 the lady of the house
olivia if i do not usurp myself i am

 yourself for what is yours to bestow is not yours
 to reserve but this is from my commission i will
 on with my speech in your praise and then show you
 the heart of my message
olivia come to what is important in't i forgive you the praise
viola alas i took great pains to study it and tis poetical
olivia it is the more like to be feigned i pray you

 and allowed your approach rather to wonder at you
 than to hear you if you be not mad be gone if
 you have reason be brief tis not that time of
 moon with me to make one in so skipping a dialogue
maria will you hoist sail sir here lies your way

 longer some mollification for your giant sweet

viola it alone concerns your ear i bring no overture of
 war no taxation of homage i hold the olive in my
 hand my words are as fun of peace as matter

 learned from my entertainment what i am and what i
 would are as secret as maidenhead to your ears
 divinity to any other's profanation

 exeunt maria and attendants
