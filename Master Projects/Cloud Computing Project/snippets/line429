act iv
scene ii the same
 enter holofernes sir nathaniel and dull
sir nathaniel very reverend sport truly and done in the testimony
 of a good conscience
holofernes the deer was as you know sanguis in blood ripe
 as the pomewater who now hangeth like a jewel in
 the ear of caelo the sky the welkin the heaven
 and anon falleth like a crab on the face of terra
 the soil the land the earth
sir nathaniel truly master holofernes the epithets are sweetly
 varied like a scholar at the least but sir i
 assure ye it was a buck of the first head
holofernes sir nathaniel haud credo
dull twas not a haud credo twas a pricket
holofernes most barbarous intimation yet a kind of
 insinuation as it were in via in way of
 explication facere as it were replication or
 rather ostentare to show as it were his
 inclination after his undressed unpolished
 uneducated unpruned untrained or rather
 unlettered or ratherest unconfirmed fashion to
 insert again my haud credo for a deer
dull i said the deer was not a haud credo twas a pricket
holofernes twicesod simplicity his coctus
 o thou monster ignorance how deformed dost thou look
sir nathaniel sir he hath never fed of the dainties that are bred
 in a book he hath not eat paper as it were he
 hath not drunk ink his intellect is not
 replenished he is only an animal only sensible in
 the duller parts
 and such barren plants are set before us that we
 thankful should be
 which we of taste and feeling are for those parts that
 do fructify in us more than he
 for as it would ill become me to be vain indiscreet or a fool
 so were there a patch set on learning to see him in a school
 but omne bene say i being of an old father's mind
 many can brook the weather that love not the wind
dull you two are bookmen can you tell me by your wit
 what was a month old at cain's birth that's not five
 weeks old as yet
holofernes dictynna goodman dull dictynna goodman dull
dull what is dictynna
sir nathaniel a title to phoebe to luna to the moon
holofernes the moon was a month old when adam was no more
 and raught not to five weeks when he came to
 fivescore
 the allusion holds in the exchange
dull tis true indeed the collusion holds in the exchange
holofernes god comfort thy capacity i say the allusion holds
 in the exchange
dull and i say the pollusion holds in the exchange for
 the moon is never but a month old and i say beside
 that twas a pricket that the princess killed
holofernes sir nathaniel will you hear an extemporal epitaph
 on the death of the deer and to humour the
 ignorant call i the deer the princess killed a pricket
sir nathaniel perge good master holofernes perge so it shall
 please you to abrogate scurrility
holofernes i will something affect the letter for it argues facility
 the preyful princess pierced and prick'd a pretty
 pleasing pricket
 some say a sore but not a sore till now made
 sore with shooting
 the dogs did yell put l to sore then sorel jumps
 from thicket
 or pricket sore or else sorel the people fall ahooting
 if sore be sore then l to sore makes fifty sores
 one sorel
 of one sore i an hundred make by adding but one more l
sir nathaniel a rare talent
dull aside if a talent be a claw look how he claws
 him with a talent
holofernes this is a gift that i have simple simple a
 foolish extravagant spirit full of forms figures
 shapes objects ideas apprehensions motions
 revolutions these are begot in the ventricle of
 memory nourished in the womb of pia mater and
 delivered upon the mellowing of occasion but the
 gift is good in those in whom it is acute and i am
 thankful for it
sir nathaniel sir i praise the lord for you and so may my
 parishioners for their sons are well tutored by
 you and their daughters profit very greatly under
 you you are a good member of the commonwealth
holofernes mehercle if their sons be ingenuous they shall
 want no instruction if their daughters be capable
 i will put it to them but vir sapit qui pauca
 loquitur a soul feminine saluteth us
 enter jaquenetta and costard
jaquenetta god give you good morrow master parson
holofernes master parson quasi person an if one should be
 pierced which is the one
costard marry master schoolmaster he that is likest to a hogshead
holofernes piercing a hogshead a good lustre of conceit in a
 tuft of earth fire enough for a flint pearl enough
 for a swine tis pretty it is well
jaquenetta good master parson be so good as read me this
 letter it was given me by costard and sent me
 from don armado i beseech you read it
holofernes fauste precor gelida quando pecus omne sub umbra
 ruminatand so forth ah good old mantuan i
 may speak of thee as the traveller doth of venice
 venetia venetia
 chi non ti vede non ti pretia
 old mantuan old mantuan who understandeth thee
 not loves thee not ut re sol la mi fa
 under pardon sir what are the contents or rather
 as horace says in hiswhat my soul verses
sir nathaniel ay sir and very learned
holofernes let me hear a staff a stanze a verse lege domine
sir nathaniel reads
 if love make me forsworn how shall i swear to love
 ah never faith could hold if not to beauty vow'd
