and he said unto her daughter thy faith hath made thee whole go in peace and be whole of thy plague
while he yet spake there came from the ruler of the synagogue's house certain which said thy daughter is dead why troublest thou the master any further
as soon as jesus heard the word that was spoken he saith unto the ruler of the synagogue be not afraid only believe
and he suffered no man to follow him save peter and james and john the brother of james
and he cometh to the house of the ruler of the synagogue and seeth the tumult and them that wept and wailed greatly
and when he was come in he saith unto them why make ye this ado and weep the damsel is not dead but sleepeth
and they laughed him to scorn but when he had put them all out he taketh the father and the mother of the damsel and them that were with him and entereth in where the damsel was lying
and he took the damsel by the hand and said unto her talitha cumi which is being interpreted damsel i say unto thee arise
and straightway the damsel arose and walked for she was of the age of twelve years and they were astonished with a great astonishment
and he charged them straitly that no man should know it and commanded that something should be given her to eat
and he went out from thence and came into his own country and his disciples follow him
and when the sabbath day was come he began to teach in the synagogue and many hearing him were astonished saying from whence hath this man these things and what wisdom is this which is given unto him that even such mighty works are wrought by his hands
is not this the carpenter the son of mary the brother of james and joses and of juda and simon and are not his sisters here with us and they were offended at him
but jesus said unto them a prophet is not without honour but in his own country and among his own kin and in his own house
and he could there do no mighty work save that he laid his hands upon a few sick folk and healed them
and he marvelled because of their unbelief and he went round about the villages teaching
and he called unto him the twelve and began to send them forth by two and two and gave them power over unclean spirits
and commanded them that they should take nothing for their journey save a staff only no scrip no bread no money in their purse
but be shod with sandals and not put on two coats
and he said unto them in what place soever ye enter into an house there abide till ye depart from that place
and whosoever shall not receive you nor hear you when ye depart thence shake off the dust under your feet for a testimony against them verily i say unto you it shall be more tolerable for sodom and gomorrha in the day of judgment than for that city
and they went out and preached that men should repent
and they cast out many devils and anointed with oil many that were sick and healed them
and king herod heard of him for his name was spread abroad and he said that john the baptist was risen from the dead and therefore mighty works do shew forth themselves in him
others said that it is elias and others said that it is a prophet or as one of the prophets
but when herod heard thereof he said it is john whom i beheaded he is risen from the dead
for herod himself had sent forth and laid hold upon john and bound him in prison for herodias sake his brother philip's wife for he had married her
for john had said unto herod it is not lawful for thee to have thy brother's wife
therefore herodias had a quarrel against him and would have killed him but she could not
for herod feared john knowing that he was a just man and an holy and observed him and when he heard him he did many things and heard him gladly
and when a convenient day was come that herod on his birthday made a supper to his lords high captains and chief estates of galilee
and when the daughter of the said herodias came in and danced and pleased herod and them that sat with him the king said unto the damsel ask of me whatsoever thou wilt and i will give it thee
and he sware unto her whatsoever thou shalt ask of me i will give it thee unto the half of my kingdom
and she went forth and said unto her mother what shall i ask and she said the head of john the baptist
and she came in straightway with haste unto the king and asked saying i will that thou give me by and by in a charger the head of john the baptist
and the king was exceeding sorry yet for his oath's sake and for their sakes which sat with him he would not reject her
and immediately the king sent an executioner and commanded his head to be brought and he went and beheaded him in the prison
and brought his head in a charger and gave it to the damsel and the damsel gave it to her mother
and when his disciples heard of it they came and took up his corpse and laid it in a tomb
and the apostles gathered themselves together unto jesus and told him all things both what they had done and what they had taught
and he said unto them come ye yourselves apart into a desert place and rest a while for there were many coming and going and they had no leisure so much as to eat
and they departed into a desert place by ship privately
and the people saw them departing and many knew him and ran afoot thither out of all cities and outwent them and came together unto him
and jesus when he came out saw much people and was moved with compassion toward them because they were as sheep not having a shepherd and he began to teach them many things
and when the day was now far spent his disciples came unto him and said this is a desert place and now the time is far passed
send them away that they may go into the country round about and into the villages and buy themselves bread for they have nothing to eat
he answered and said unto them give ye them to eat and they say unto him shall we go and buy two hundred pennyworth of bread and give them to eat
he saith unto them how many loaves have ye go and see and when they knew they say five and two fishes
and he commanded them to make all sit down by companies upon the green grass
and they sat down in ranks by hundreds and by fifties
and when he had taken the five loaves and the two fishes he looked up to heaven and blessed and brake the loaves and gave them to his disciples to set before them and the two fishes divided he among them all
and they did all eat and were filled
and they took up twelve baskets full of the fragments and of the fishes
and they that did eat of the loaves were about five thousand men
and straightway he constrained his disciples to get into the ship and to go to the other side before unto bethsaida while he sent away the people
and when he had sent them away he departed into a mountain to pray
and when even was come the ship was in the midst of the sea and he alone on the land
and he saw them toiling in rowing for the wind was contrary unto them and about the fourth watch of the night he cometh unto them walking upon the sea and would have passed by them
but when they saw him walking upon the sea they supposed it had been a spirit and cried out
for they all saw him and were troubled and immediately he talked with them and saith unto them be of good cheer it is i be not afraid
and he went up unto them into the ship and the wind ceased and they were sore amazed in themselves beyond measure and wondered
for they considered not the miracle of the loaves for their heart was hardened
and when they had passed over they came into the land of gennesaret and drew to the shore
and when they were come out of the ship straightway they knew him
and ran through that whole region round about and began to carry about in beds those that were sick where they heard he was
and whithersoever he entered into villages or cities or country they laid the sick in the streets and besought him that they might touch if it were but the border of his garment and as many as touched him were made whole
then came together unto him the pharisees and certain of the scribes which came from jerusalem
and when they saw some of his disciples eat bread with defiled that is to say with unwashen hands they found fault
for the pharisees and all the jews except they wash their hands oft eat not holding the tradition of the elders
and when they come from the market except they wash they eat not and many other things there be which they have received to hold as the washing of cups and pots brasen vessels and of tables
then the pharisees and scribes asked him why walk not thy disciples according to the tradition of the elders but eat bread with unwashen hands
he answered and said unto them well hath esaias prophesied of you hypocrites as it is written this people honoureth me with their lips but their heart is far from me
howbeit in vain do they worship me teaching for doctrines the commandments of men
for laying aside the commandment of god ye hold the tradition of men as the washing of pots and cups and many other such like things ye do
and he said unto them full well ye reject the commandment of god that ye may keep your own tradition
for moses said honour thy father and thy mother and whoso curseth father or mother let him die the death
but ye say if a man shall say to his father or mother it is corban that is to say a gift by whatsoever thou mightest be profited by me he shall be free
and ye suffer him no more to do ought for his father or his mother
making the word of god of none effect through your tradition which ye have delivered and many such like things do ye
and when he had called all the people unto him he said unto them hearken unto me every one of you and understand
there is nothing from without a man that entering into him can defile him but the things which come out of him those are they that defile the man
if any man have ears to hear let him hear
and when he was entered into the house from the people his disciples asked him concerning the parable
and he saith unto them are ye so without understanding also do ye not perceive that whatsoever thing from without entereth into the man it cannot defile him
because it entereth not into his heart but into the belly and goeth out into the draught purging all meats
and he said that which cometh out of the man that defileth the man
for from within out of the heart of men proceed evil thoughts adulteries fornications murders
thefts covetousness wickedness deceit lasciviousness an evil eye blasphemy pride foolishness
all these evil things come from within and defile the man
and from thence he arose and went into the borders of tyre and sidon and entered into an house and would have no man know it but he could not be hid
for a certain woman whose young daughter had an unclean spirit heard of him and came and fell at his feet
the woman was a greek a syrophenician by nation and she besought him that he would cast forth the devil out of her daughter
but jesus said unto her let the children first be filled for it is not meet to take the children's bread and to cast it unto the dogs
and she answered and said unto him yes lord yet the dogs under the table eat of the children's crumbs
and he said unto her for this saying go thy way the devil is gone out of thy daughter
and when she was come to her house she found the devil gone out and her daughter laid upon the bed
and again departing from the coasts of tyre and sidon he came unto the sea of galilee through the midst of the coasts of decapolis
and they bring unto him one that was deaf and had an impediment in his speech and they beseech him to put his hand upon him
and he took him aside from the multitude and put his fingers into his ears and he spit and touched his tongue
and looking up to heaven he sighed and saith unto him ephphatha that is be opened
and straightway his ears were opened and the string of his tongue was loosed and he spake plain
and he charged them that they should tell no man but the more he charged them so much the more a great deal they published it
and were beyond measure astonished saying he hath done all things well he maketh both the deaf to hear and the dumb to speak
in those days the multitude being very great and having nothing to eat jesus called his disciples unto him and saith unto them
i have compassion on the multitude because they have now been with me three days and have nothing to eat
and if i send them away fasting to their own houses they will faint by the way for divers of them came from far
and his disciples answered him from whence can a man satisfy these men with bread here in the wilderness
and he asked them how many loaves have ye and they said seven
and he commanded the people to sit down on the ground and he took the seven loaves and gave thanks and brake and gave to his disciples to set before them and they did set them before the people
and they had a few small fishes and he blessed and commanded to set them also before them
so they did eat and were filled and they took up of the broken meat that was left seven baskets
and they that had eaten were about four thousand and he sent them away
and straightway he entered into a ship with his disciples and came into the parts of dalmanutha
and the pharisees came forth and began to question with him seeking of him a sign from heaven tempting him
and he sighed deeply in his spirit and saith why doth this generation seek after a sign verily i say unto you there shall no sign be given unto this generation
and he left them and entering into the ship again departed to the other side
now the disciples had forgotten to take bread neither had they in the ship with them more than one loaf
and he charged them saying take heed beware of the leaven of the pharisees and of the leaven of herod
and they reasoned among themselves saying it is because we have no bread
and when jesus knew it he saith unto them why reason ye because ye have no bread perceive ye not yet neither understand have ye your heart yet hardened
having eyes see ye not and having ears hear ye not and do ye not remember
when i brake the five loaves among five thousand how many baskets full of fragments took ye up they say unto him twelve
and when the seven among four thousand how many baskets full of fragments took ye up and they said seven
and he said unto them how is it that ye do not understand
and he cometh to bethsaida and they bring a blind man unto him and besought him to touch him
and he took the blind man by the hand and led him out of the town and when he had spit on his eyes and put his hands upon him he asked him if he saw ought
and he looked up and said i see men as trees walking
after that he put his hands again upon his eyes and made him look up and he was restored and saw every man clearly
and he sent him away to his house saying neither go into the town nor tell it to any in the town
and jesus went out and his disciples into the towns of caesarea philippi and by the way he asked his disciples saying unto them whom do men say that i am
and they answered john the baptist but some say elias and others one of the prophets
and he saith unto them but whom say ye that i am and peter answereth and saith unto him thou art the christ
and he charged them that they should tell no man of him
and he began to teach them that the son of man must suffer many things and be rejected of the elders and of the chief priests and scribes and be killed and after three days rise again
and he spake that saying openly and peter took him and began to rebuke him
but when he had turned about and looked on his disciples he rebuked peter saying get thee behind me satan for thou savourest not the things that be of god but the things that be of men
and when he had called the people unto him with his disciples also he said unto them whosoever will come after me let him deny himself and take up his cross and follow me
for whosoever will save his life shall lose it but whosoever shall lose his life for my sake and the gospel's the same shall save it
for what shall it profit a man if he shall gain the whole world and lose his own soul
or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul
whosoever therefore shall be ashamed of me and of my words in this adulterous and sinful generation of him also shall the son of man be ashamed when he cometh in the glory of his father with the holy angels
and he said unto them verily i say unto you that there be some of them that stand here which shall not taste of death till they have seen the kingdom of god come with power
and after six days jesus taketh with him peter and james and john and leadeth them up into an high mountain apart by themselves and he was transfigured before them
and his raiment became shining exceeding white as snow so as no fuller on earth can white them
and there appeared unto them elias with moses and they were talking with jesus
and peter answered and said to jesus master it is good for us to be here and let us make three tabernacles one for thee and one for moses and one for elias
for he wist not what to say for they were sore afraid
and there was a cloud that overshadowed them and a voice came out of the cloud saying this is my beloved son hear him
and suddenly when they had looked round about they saw no man any more save jesus only with themselves
and as they came down from the mountain he charged them that they should tell no man what things they had seen till the son of man were risen from the dead
and they kept that saying with themselves questioning one with another what the rising from the dead should mean
and they asked him saying why say the scribes that elias must first come
and he answered and told them elias verily cometh first and restoreth all things and how it is written of the son of man that he must suffer many things and be set at nought
but i say unto you that elias is indeed come and they have done unto him whatsoever they listed as it is written of him
and when he came to his disciples he saw a great multitude about them and the scribes questioning with them
and straightway all the people when they beheld him were greatly amazed and running to him saluted him
and he asked the scribes what question ye with them
and one of the multitude answered and said master i have brought unto thee my son which hath a dumb spirit
and wheresoever he taketh him he teareth him and he foameth and gnasheth with his teeth and pineth away and i spake to thy disciples that they should cast him out and they could not
he answereth him and saith o faithless generation how long shall i be with you how long shall i suffer you bring him unto me
and they brought him unto him and when he saw him straightway the spirit tare him and he fell on the ground and wallowed foaming
and he asked his father how long is it ago since this came unto him and he said of a child
and ofttimes it hath cast him into the fire and into the waters to destroy him but if thou canst do any thing have compassion on us and help us
jesus said unto him if thou canst believe all things are possible to him that believeth
and straightway the father of the child cried out and said with tears lord i believe help thou mine unbelief
when jesus saw that the people came running together he rebuked the foul spirit saying unto him thou dumb and deaf spirit i charge thee come out of him and enter no more into him
and the spirit cried and rent him sore and came out of him and he was as one dead insomuch that many said he is dead
but jesus took him by the hand and lifted him up and he arose
and when he was come into the house his disciples asked him privately why could not we cast him out
and he said unto them this kind can come forth by nothing but by prayer and fasting
and they departed thence and passed through galilee and he would not that any man should know it
for he taught his disciples and said unto them the son of man is delivered into the hands of men and they shall kill him and after that he is killed he shall rise the third day
but they understood not that saying and were afraid to ask him
and he came to capernaum and being in the house he asked them what was it that ye disputed among yourselves by the way
but they held their peace for by the way they had disputed among themselves who should be the greatest
and he sat down and called the twelve and saith unto them if any man desire to be first the same shall be last of all and servant of all
and he took a child and set him in the midst of them and when he had taken him in his arms he said unto them
whosoever shall receive one of such children in my name receiveth me and whosoever shall receive me receiveth not me but him that sent me
and john answered him saying master we saw one casting out devils in thy name and he followeth not us and we forbad him because he followeth not us
but jesus said forbid him not for there is no man which shall do a miracle in my name that can lightly speak evil of me
for he that is not against us is on our part
for whosoever shall give you a cup of water to drink in my name because ye belong to christ verily i say unto you he shall not lose his reward
and whosoever shall offend one of these little ones that believe in me it is better for him that a millstone were hanged about his neck and he were cast into the sea
and if thy hand offend thee cut it off it is better for thee to enter into life maimed than having two hands to go into hell into the fire that never shall be quenched
where their worm dieth not and the fire is not quenched
and if thy foot offend thee cut it off it is better for thee to enter halt into life than having two feet to be cast into hell into the fire that never shall be quenched
where their worm dieth not and the fire is not quenched
and if thine eye offend thee pluck it out it is better for thee to enter into the kingdom of god with one eye than having two eyes to be cast into hell fire
where their worm dieth not and the fire is not quenched
for every one shall be salted with fire and every sacrifice shall be salted with salt
salt is good but if the salt have lost his saltness wherewith will ye season it have salt in yourselves and have peace one with another
and he arose from thence and cometh into the coasts of judaea by the farther side of jordan and the people resort unto him again and as he was wont he taught them again
and the pharisees came to him and asked him is it lawful for a man to put away his wife tempting him
and he answered and said unto them what did moses command you
and they said moses suffered to write a bill of divorcement and to put her away
and jesus answered and said unto them for the hardness of your heart he wrote you this precept
but from the beginning of the creation god made them male and female
for this cause shall a man leave his father and mother and cleave to his wife
and they twain shall be one flesh so then they are no more twain but one flesh
what therefore god hath joined together let not man put asunder
