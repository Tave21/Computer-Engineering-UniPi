for if the truth of god hath more abounded through my lie unto his glory why yet am i also judged as a sinner
and not rather as we be slanderously reported and as some affirm that we say let us do evil that good may come whose damnation is just
what then are we better than they no in no wise for we have before proved both jews and gentiles that they are all under sin
as it is written there is none righteous no not one
there is none that understandeth there is none that seeketh after god
they are all gone out of the way they are together become unprofitable there is none that doeth good no not one
their throat is an open sepulchre with their tongues they have used deceit the poison of asps is under their lips
whose mouth is full of cursing and bitterness
their feet are swift to shed blood
destruction and misery are in their ways
and the way of peace have they not known
there is no fear of god before their eyes
now we know that what things soever the law saith it saith to them who are under the law that every mouth may be stopped and all the world may become guilty before god
therefore by the deeds of the law there shall no flesh be justified in his sight for by the law is the knowledge of sin
but now the righteousness of god without the law is manifested being witnessed by the law and the prophets
even the righteousness of god which is by faith of jesus christ unto all and upon all them that believe for there is no difference
for all have sinned and come short of the glory of god
being justified freely by his grace through the redemption that is in christ jesus
whom god hath set forth to be a propitiation through faith in his blood to declare his righteousness for the remission of sins that are past through the forbearance of god
to declare i say at this time his righteousness that he might be just and the justifier of him which believeth in jesus
where is boasting then it is excluded by what law of works nay but by the law of faith
therefore we conclude that a man is justified by faith without the deeds of the law
is he the god of the jews only is he not also of the gentiles yes of the gentiles also
seeing it is one god which shall justify the circumcision by faith and uncircumcision through faith
do we then make void the law through faith god forbid yea we establish the law
what shall we say then that abraham our father as pertaining to the flesh hath found
for if abraham were justified by works he hath whereof to glory but not before god
for what saith the scripture abraham believed god and it was counted unto him for righteousness
now to him that worketh is the reward not reckoned of grace but of debt
but to him that worketh not but believeth on him that justifieth the ungodly his faith is counted for righteousness
even as david also describeth the blessedness of the man unto whom god imputeth righteousness without works
saying blessed are they whose iniquities are forgiven and whose sins are covered
blessed is the man to whom the lord will not impute sin
cometh this blessedness then upon the circumcision only or upon the uncircumcision also for we say that faith was reckoned to abraham for righteousness
how was it then reckoned when he was in circumcision or in uncircumcision not in circumcision but in uncircumcision
and he received the sign of circumcision a seal of the righteousness of the faith which he had yet being uncircumcised that he might be the father of all them that believe though they be not circumcised that righteousness might be imputed unto them also
and the father of circumcision to them who are not of the circumcision only but who also walk in the steps of that faith of our father abraham which he had being yet uncircumcised
for the promise that he should be the heir of the world was not to abraham or to his seed through the law but through the righteousness of faith
for if they which are of the law be heirs faith is made void and the promise made of none effect
because the law worketh wrath for where no law is there is no transgression
therefore it is of faith that it might be by grace to the end the promise might be sure to all the seed not to that only which is of the law but to that also which is of the faith of abraham who is the father of us all
as it is written i have made thee a father of many nations before him whom he believed even god who quickeneth the dead and calleth those things which be not as though they were
who against hope believed in hope that he might become the father of many nations according to that which was spoken so shall thy seed be
and being not weak in faith he considered not his own body now dead when he was about an hundred years old neither yet the deadness of sarah's womb
he staggered not at the promise of god through unbelief but was strong in faith giving glory to god
and being fully persuaded that what he had promised he was able also to perform
and therefore it was imputed to him for righteousness
now it was not written for his sake alone that it was imputed to him
but for us also to whom it shall be imputed if we believe on him that raised up jesus our lord from the dead
who was delivered for our offences and was raised again for our justification
therefore being justified by faith we have peace with god through our lord jesus christ
by whom also we have access by faith into this grace wherein we stand and rejoice in hope of the glory of god
and not only so but we glory in tribulations also knowing that tribulation worketh patience
and patience experience and experience hope
and hope maketh not ashamed because the love of god is shed abroad in our hearts by the holy ghost which is given unto us
for when we were yet without strength in due time christ died for the ungodly
for scarcely for a righteous man will one die yet peradventure for a good man some would even dare to die
but god commendeth his love toward us in that while we were yet sinners christ died for us
much more then being now justified by his blood we shall be saved from wrath through him
for if when we were enemies we were reconciled to god by the death of his son much more being reconciled we shall be saved by his life
and not only so but we also joy in god through our lord jesus christ by whom we have now received the atonement
wherefore as by one man sin entered into the world and death by sin and so death passed upon all men for that all have sinned
for until the law sin was in the world but sin is not imputed when there is no law
nevertheless death reigned from adam to moses even over them that had not sinned after the similitude of adam's transgression who is the figure of him that was to come
but not as the offence so also is the free gift for if through the offence of one many be dead much more the grace of god and the gift by grace which is by one man jesus christ hath abounded unto many
and not as it was by one that sinned so is the gift for the judgment was by one to condemnation but the free gift is of many offences unto justification
for if by one man's offence death reigned by one much more they which receive abundance of grace and of the gift of righteousness shall reign in life by one jesus christ
therefore as by the offence of one judgment came upon all men to condemnation even so by the righteousness of one the free gift came upon all men unto justification of life
for as by one man's disobedience many were made sinners so by the obedience of one shall many be made righteous
moreover the law entered that the offence might abound but where sin abounded grace did much more abound
that as sin hath reigned unto death even so might grace reign through righteousness unto eternal life by jesus christ our lord
what shall we say then shall we continue in sin that grace may abound
god forbid how shall we that are dead to sin live any longer therein
know ye not that so many of us as were baptized into jesus christ were baptized into his death
therefore we are buried with him by baptism into death that like as christ was raised up from the dead by the glory of the father even so we also should walk in newness of life
for if we have been planted together in the likeness of his death we shall be also in the likeness of his resurrection
knowing this that our old man is crucified with him that the body of sin might be destroyed that henceforth we should not serve sin
for he that is dead is freed from sin
now if we be dead with christ we believe that we shall also live with him
knowing that christ being raised from the dead dieth no more death hath no more dominion over him
for in that he died he died unto sin once but in that he liveth he liveth unto god
likewise reckon ye also yourselves to be dead indeed unto sin but alive unto god through jesus christ our lord
let not sin therefore reign in your mortal body that ye should obey it in the lusts thereof
neither yield ye your members as instruments of unrighteousness unto sin but yield yourselves unto god as those that are alive from the dead and your members as instruments of righteousness unto god
for sin shall not have dominion over you for ye are not under the law but under grace
what then shall we sin because we are not under the law but under grace god forbid
know ye not that to whom ye yield yourselves servants to obey his servants ye are to whom ye obey whether of sin unto death or of obedience unto righteousness
but god be thanked that ye were the servants of sin but ye have obeyed from the heart that form of doctrine which was delivered you
being then made free from sin ye became the servants of righteousness
i speak after the manner of men because of the infirmity of your flesh for as ye have yielded your members servants to uncleanness and to iniquity unto iniquity even so now yield your members servants to righteousness unto holiness
for when ye were the servants of sin ye were free from righteousness
what fruit had ye then in those things whereof ye are now ashamed for the end of those things is death
but now being made free from sin and become servants to god ye have your fruit unto holiness and the end everlasting life
for the wages of sin is death but the gift of god is eternal life through jesus christ our lord
know ye not brethren for i speak to them that know the law how that the law hath dominion over a man as long as he liveth
for the woman which hath an husband is bound by the law to her husband so long as he liveth but if the husband be dead she is loosed from the law of her husband
so then if while her husband liveth she be married to another man she shall be called an adulteress but if her husband be dead she is free from that law so that she is no adulteress though she be married to another man
wherefore my brethren ye also are become dead to the law by the body of christ that ye should be married to another even to him who is raised from the dead that we should bring forth fruit unto god
for when we were in the flesh the motions of sins which were by the law did work in our members to bring forth fruit unto death
but now we are delivered from the law that being dead wherein we were held that we should serve in newness of spirit and not in the oldness of the letter
what shall we say then is the law sin god forbid nay i had not known sin but by the law for i had not known lust except the law had said thou shalt not covet
but sin taking occasion by the commandment wrought in me all manner of concupiscence for without the law sin was dead
for i was alive without the law once but when the commandment came sin revived and i died
and the commandment which was ordained to life i found to be unto death
for sin taking occasion by the commandment deceived me and by it slew me
wherefore the law is holy and the commandment holy and just and good
was then that which is good made death unto me god forbid but sin that it might appear sin working death in me by that which is good that sin by the commandment might become exceeding sinful
for we know that the law is spiritual but i am carnal sold under sin
for that which i do i allow not for what i would that do i not but what i hate that do i
if then i do that which i would not i consent unto the law that it is good
now then it is no more i that do it but sin that dwelleth in me
for i know that in me that is in my flesh dwelleth no good thing for to will is present with me but how to perform that which is good i find not
for the good that i would i do not but the evil which i would not that i do
now if i do that i would not it is no more i that do it but sin that dwelleth in me
i find then a law that when i would do good evil is present with me
for i delight in the law of god after the inward man
but i see another law in my members warring against the law of my mind and bringing me into captivity to the law of sin which is in my members
o wretched man that i am who shall deliver me from the body of this death
i thank god through jesus christ our lord so then with the mind i myself serve the law of god but with the flesh the law of sin
there is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in christ jesus who walk not after the flesh but after the spirit
for the law of the spirit of life in christ jesus hath made me free from the law of sin and death
for what the law could not do in that it was weak through the flesh god sending his own son in the likeness of sinful flesh and for sin condemned sin in the flesh
that the righteousness of the law might be fulfilled in us who walk not after the flesh but after the spirit
for they that are after the flesh do mind the things of the flesh but they that are after the spirit the things of the spirit
for to be carnally minded is death but to be spiritually minded is life and peace
because the carnal mind is enmity against god for it is not subject to the law of god neither indeed can be
so then they that are in the flesh cannot please god
but ye are not in the flesh but in the spirit if so be that the spirit of god dwell in you now if any man have not the spirit of christ he is none of his
and if christ be in you the body is dead because of sin but the spirit is life because of righteousness
but if the spirit of him that raised up jesus from the dead dwell in you he that raised up christ from the dead shall also quicken your mortal bodies by his spirit that dwelleth in you
therefore brethren we are debtors not to the flesh to live after the flesh
for if ye live after the flesh ye shall die but if ye through the spirit do mortify the deeds of the body ye shall live
for as many as are led by the spirit of god they are the sons of god
for ye have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear but ye have received the spirit of adoption whereby we cry abba father
the spirit itself beareth witness with our spirit that we are the children of god
and if children then heirs heirs of god and jointheirs with christ if so be that we suffer with him that we may be also glorified together
for i reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us
for the earnest expectation of the creature waiteth for the manifestation of the sons of god
for the creature was made subject to vanity not willingly but by reason of him who hath subjected the same in hope
because the creature itself also shall be delivered from the bondage of corruption into the glorious liberty of the children of god
for we know that the whole creation groaneth and travaileth in pain together until now
and not only they but ourselves also which have the firstfruits of the spirit even we ourselves groan within ourselves waiting for the adoption to wit the redemption of our body
for we are saved by hope but hope that is seen is not hope for what a man seeth why doth he yet hope for
but if we hope for that we see not then do we with patience wait for it
likewise the spirit also helpeth our infirmities for we know not what we should pray for as we ought but the spirit itself maketh intercession for us with groanings which cannot be uttered
and he that searcheth the hearts knoweth what is the mind of the spirit because he maketh intercession for the saints according to the will of god
and we know that all things work together for good to them that love god to them who are the called according to his purpose
for whom he did foreknow he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his son that he might be the firstborn among many brethren
moreover whom he did predestinate them he also called and whom he called them he also justified and whom he justified them he also glorified
what shall we then say to these things if god be for us who can be against us
he that spared not his own son but delivered him up for us all how shall he not with him also freely give us all things
who shall lay any thing to the charge of god's elect it is god that justifieth
who is he that condemneth it is christ that died yea rather that is risen again who is even at the right hand of god who also maketh intercession for us
who shall separate us from the love of christ shall tribulation or distress or persecution or famine or nakedness or peril or sword
as it is written for thy sake we are killed all the day long we are accounted as sheep for the slaughter
nay in all these things we are more than conquerors through him that loved us
for i am persuaded that neither death nor life nor angels nor principalities nor powers nor things present nor things to come
nor height nor depth nor any other creature shall be able to separate us from the love of god which is in christ jesus our lord
i say the truth in christ i lie not my conscience also bearing me witness in the holy ghost
that i have great heaviness and continual sorrow in my heart
for i could wish that myself were accursed from christ for my brethren my kinsmen according to the flesh
who are israelites to whom pertaineth the adoption and the glory and the covenants and the giving of the law and the service of god and the promises
whose are the fathers and of whom as concerning the flesh christ came who is over all god blessed for ever amen
not as though the word of god hath taken none effect for they are not all israel which are of israel
neither because they are the seed of abraham are they all children but in isaac shall thy seed be called
that is they which are the children of the flesh these are not the children of god but the children of the promise are counted for the seed
for this is the word of promise at this time will i come and sarah shall have a son
and not only this but when rebecca also had conceived by one even by our father isaac
for the children being not yet born neither having done any good or evil that the purpose of god according to election might stand not of works but of him that calleth
it was said unto her the elder shall serve the younger
as it is written jacob have i loved but esau have i hated
what shall we say then is there unrighteousness with god god forbid
for he saith to moses i will have mercy on whom i will have mercy and i will have compassion on whom i will have compassion
so then it is not of him that willeth nor of him that runneth but of god that sheweth mercy
for the scripture saith unto pharaoh even for this same purpose have i raised thee up that i might shew my power in thee and that my name might be declared throughout all the earth
therefore hath he mercy on whom he will have mercy and whom he will he hardeneth
thou wilt say then unto me why doth he yet find fault for who hath resisted his will
nay but o man who art thou that repliest against god shall the thing formed say to him that formed it why hast thou made me thus
hath not the potter power over the clay of the same lump to make one vessel unto honour and another unto dishonour
what if god willing to shew his wrath and to make his power known endured with much longsuffering the vessels of wrath fitted to destruction
and that he might make known the riches of his glory on the vessels of mercy which he had afore prepared unto glory
even us whom he hath called not of the jews only but also of the gentiles
as he saith also in osee i will call them my people which were not my people and her beloved which was not beloved
and it shall come to pass that in the place where it was said unto them ye are not my people there shall they be called the children of the living god
esaias also crieth concerning israel though the number of the children of israel be as the sand of the sea a remnant shall be saved
for he will finish the work and cut it short in righteousness because a short work will the lord make upon the earth
and as esaias said before except the lord of sabaoth had left us a seed we had been as sodoma and been made like unto gomorrha
what shall we say then that the gentiles which followed not after righteousness have attained to righteousness even the righteousness which is of faith
but israel which followed after the law of righteousness hath not attained to the law of righteousness
wherefore because they sought it not by faith but as it were by the works of the law for they stumbled at that stumblingstone
as it is written behold i lay in sion a stumblingstone and rock of offence and whosoever believeth on him shall not be ashamed
brethren my heart's desire and prayer to god for israel is that they might be saved
for i bear them record that they have a zeal of god but not according to knowledge
for they being ignorant of god's righteousness and going about to establish their own righteousness have not submitted themselves unto the righteousness of god
for christ is the end of the law for righteousness to every one that believeth
for moses describeth the righteousness which is of the law that the man which doeth those things shall live by them
but the righteousness which is of faith speaketh on this wise say not in thine heart who shall ascend into heaven that is to bring christ down from above
or who shall descend into the deep that is to bring up christ again from the dead
but what saith it the word is nigh thee even in thy mouth and in thy heart that is the word of faith which we preach
that if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the lord jesus and shalt believe in thine heart that god hath raised him from the dead thou shalt be saved
