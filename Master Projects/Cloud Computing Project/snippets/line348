when thou shalt be disposed to set me light
and place my merit in the eye of scorn
upon thy side against myself i'll fight
and prove thee virtuous though thou art forsworn
with mine own weakness being best acquainted
upon thy part i can set down a story
of faults conceal'd wherein i am attainted
that thou in losing me shalt win much glory
and i by this will be a gainer too
for bending all my loving thoughts on thee
the injuries that to myself i do
doing thee vantage doublevantage me
 such is my love to thee i so belong
 that for thy right myself will bear all wrong
lxxxix
say that thou didst forsake me for some fault
and i will comment upon that offence
speak of my lameness and i straight will halt
against thy reasons making no defence
thou canst not love disgrace me half so ill
to set a form upon desired change
as i'll myself disgrace knowing thy will
i will acquaintance strangle and look strange
be absent from thy walks and in my tongue
thy sweet beloved name no more shall dwell
lest i too much profane should do it wrong
and haply of our old acquaintance tell
 for thee against myself i'll vow debate
 for i must ne'er love him whom thou dost hate
xc
then hate me when thou wilt if ever now
now while the world is bent my deeds to cross
join with the spite of fortune make me bow
and do not drop in for an afterloss
ah do not when my heart hath scoped this sorrow
come in the rearward of a conquer'd woe
give not a windy night a rainy morrow
to linger out a purposed overthrow
if thou wilt leave me do not leave me last
when other petty griefs have done their spite
but in the onset come so shall i taste
at first the very worst of fortune's might
 and other strains of woe which now seem woe
 compared with loss of thee will not seem so
xci
some glory in their birth some in their skill
some in their wealth some in their bodies force
some in their garments though newfangled ill
some in their hawks and hounds some in their horse
and every humour hath his adjunct pleasure
wherein it finds a joy above the rest
but these particulars are not my measure
all these i better in one general best
thy love is better than high birth to me
richer than wealth prouder than garments cost
of more delight than hawks or horses be
and having thee of all men's pride i boast
 wretched in this alone that thou mayst take
 all this away and me most wretched make
xcii
but do thy worst to steal thyself away
for term of life thou art assured mine
and life no longer than thy love will stay
for it depends upon that love of thine
then need i not to fear the worst of wrongs
when in the least of them my life hath end
i see a better state to me belongs
than that which on thy humour doth depend
thou canst not vex me with inconstant mind
since that my life on thy revolt doth lie
o what a happy title do i find
happy to have thy love happy to die
 but what's so blessedfair that fears no blot
 thou mayst be false and yet i know it not
xciii
so shall i live supposing thou art true
like a deceived husband so love's face
may still seem love to me though alter'd new
thy looks with me thy heart in other place
for there can live no hatred in thine eye
therefore in that i cannot know thy change
in many's looks the false heart's history
is writ in moods and frowns and wrinkles strange
but heaven in thy creation did decree
that in thy face sweet love should ever dwell
whate'er thy thoughts or thy heart's workings be
thy looks should nothing thence but sweetness tell
 how like eve's apple doth thy beauty grow
 if thy sweet virtue answer not thy show
xciv
they that have power to hurt and will do none
that do not do the thing they most do show
who moving others are themselves as stone
unmoved cold and to temptation slow
they rightly do inherit heaven's graces
and husband nature's riches from expense
they are the lords and owners of their faces
others but stewards of their excellence
the summer's flower is to the summer sweet
though to itself it only live and die
but if that flower with base infection meet
the basest weed outbraves his dignity
 for sweetest things turn sourest by their deeds
 lilies that fester smell far worse than weeds
xcv
how sweet and lovely dost thou make the shame
which like a canker in the fragrant rose
doth spot the beauty of thy budding name
o in what sweets dost thou thy sins enclose
that tongue that tells the story of thy days
making lascivious comments on thy sport
cannot dispraise but in a kind of praise
naming thy name blesses an ill report
o what a mansion have those vices got
which for their habitation chose out thee
where beauty's veil doth cover every blot
and all things turn to fair that eyes can see
 take heed dear heart of this large privilege
 the hardest knife illused doth lose his edge
xcvi
some say thy fault is youth some wantonness
some say thy grace is youth and gentle sport
both grace and faults are loved of more and less
thou makest faults graces that to thee resort
as on the finger of a throned queen
the basest jewel will be well esteem'd
so are those errors that in thee are seen
to truths translated and for true things deem'd
how many lambs might the stem wolf betray
if like a lamb he could his looks translate
how many gazers mightst thou lead away
if thou wouldst use the strength of all thy state
 but do not so i love thee in such sort
 as thou being mine mine is thy good report
xcvii
how like a winter hath my absence been
from thee the pleasure of the fleeting year
what freezings have i felt what dark days seen
what old december's bareness every where
and yet this time removed was summer's time
the teeming autumn big with rich increase
bearing the wanton burden of the prime
like widow'd wombs after their lords decease
yet this abundant issue seem'd to me
but hope of orphans and unfather'd fruit
for summer and his pleasures wait on thee
and thou away the very birds are mute
 or if they sing tis with so dull a cheer
 that leaves look pale dreading the winter's near
xcviii
from you have i been absent in the spring
when proudpied april dress'd in all his trim
hath put a spirit of youth in every thing
that heavy saturn laugh'd and leap'd with him
yet nor the lays of birds nor the sweet smell
of different flowers in odour and in hue
could make me any summer's story tell
or from their proud lap pluck them where they grew
nor did i wonder at the lily's white
nor praise the deep vermilion in the rose
they were but sweet but figures of delight
drawn after you you pattern of all those
 yet seem'd it winter still and you away
 as with your shadow i with these did play
xcix
the forward violet thus did i chide
sweet thief whence didst thou steal thy sweet that smells
if not from my love's breath the purple pride
which on thy soft cheek for complexion dwells
in my love's veins thou hast too grossly dyed
the lily i condemned for thy hand
and buds of marjoram had stol'n thy hair
the roses fearfully on thorns did stand
one blushing shame another white despair
a third nor red nor white had stol'n of both
and to his robbery had annex'd thy breath
but for his theft in pride of all his growth
a vengeful canker eat him up to death
 more flowers i noted yet i none could see
 but sweet or colour it had stol'n from thee
c
where art thou muse that thou forget'st so long
to speak of that which gives thee all thy might
spend'st thou thy fury on some worthless song
darkening thy power to lend base subjects light
return forgetful muse and straight redeem
in gentle numbers time so idly spent
sing to the ear that doth thy lays esteem
and gives thy pen both skill and argument
rise resty muse my love's sweet face survey
if time have any wrinkle graven there
if any be a satire to decay
and make time's spoils despised every where
 give my love fame faster than time wastes life
 so thou prevent'st his scythe and crooked knife
ci
o truant muse what shall be thy amends
for thy neglect of truth in beauty dyed
both truth and beauty on my love depends
so dost thou too and therein dignified
