 nor change my countenance for this arrest
 a heart unspotted is not easily daunted
 the purest spring is not so free from mud
 as i am clear from treason to my sovereign
 who can accuse me wherein am i guilty
york tis thought my lord that you took bribes of france
 and being protector stayed the soldiers pay
 by means whereof his highness hath lost france
gloucester is it but thought so what are they that think it
 i never robb'd the soldiers of their pay
 nor ever had one penny bribe from france
 so help me god as i have watch'd the night
 ay night by night in studying good for england
 that doit that e'er i wrested from the king
 or any groat i hoarded to my use
 be brought against me at my trialday
 no many a pound of mine own proper store
 because i would not tax the needy commons
 have i disbursed to the garrisons
 and never ask'd for restitution
cardinal it serves you well my lord to say so much
gloucester i say no more than truth so help me god
york in your protectorship you did devise
 strange tortures for offenders never heard of
 that england was defamed by tyranny
gloucester why tis well known that whiles i was
 protector
 pity was all the fault that was in me
 for i should melt at an offender's tears
 and lowly words were ransom for their fault
 unless it were a bloody murderer
 or foul felonious thief that fleeced poor passengers
 i never gave them condign punishment
 murder indeed that bloody sin i tortured
 above the felon or what trespass else
suffolk my lord these faults are easy quickly answered
 but mightier crimes are laid unto your charge
 whereof you cannot easily purge yourself
 i do arrest you in his highness name
 and here commit you to my lord cardinal
 to keep until your further time of trial
king henry vi my lord of gloucester tis my special hope
 that you will clear yourself from all suspect
 my conscience tells me you are innocent
gloucester ah gracious lord these days are dangerous
 virtue is choked with foul ambition
 and charity chased hence by rancour's hand
 foul subornation is predominant
 and equity exiled your highness land
 i know their complot is to have my life
 and if my death might make this island happy
 and prove the period of their tyranny
 i would expend it with all willingness
 but mine is made the prologue to their play
 for thousands more that yet suspect no peril
 will not conclude their plotted tragedy
 beaufort's red sparkling eyes blab his heart's malice
 and suffolk's cloudy brow his stormy hate
 sharp buckingham unburthens with his tongue
 the envious load that lies upon his heart
 and dogged york that reaches at the moon
 whose overweening arm i have pluck'd back
 by false accuse doth level at my life
 and you my sovereign lady with the rest
 causeless have laid disgraces on my head
 and with your best endeavour have stirr'd up
 my liefest liege to be mine enemy
 ay all you have laid your heads together
 myself had notice of your conventicles
 and all to make away my guiltless life
 i shall not want false witness to condemn me
 nor store of treasons to augment my guilt
 the ancient proverb will be well effected
 a staff is quickly found to beat a dog'
cardinal my liege his railing is intolerable
 if those that care to keep your royal person
 from treason's secret knife and traitors rage
 be thus upbraided chid and rated at
 and the offender granted scope of speech
 twill make them cool in zeal unto your grace
suffolk hath he not twit our sovereign lady here
 with ignominious words though clerkly couch'd
 as if she had suborned some to swear
 false allegations to o'erthrow his state
queen margaret but i can give the loser leave to chide
gloucester far truer spoke than meant i lose indeed
 beshrew the winners for they play'd me false
 and well such losers may have leave to speak
buckingham he'll wrest the sense and hold us here all day
 lord cardinal he is your prisoner
cardinal sirs take away the duke and guard him sure
gloucester ah thus king henry throws away his crutch
 before his legs be firm to bear his body
 thus is the shepherd beaten from thy side
 and wolves are gnarling who shall gnaw thee first
 ah that my fear were false ah that it were
 for good king henry thy decay i fear
 exit guarded
king henry vi my lords what to your wisdoms seemeth best
 do or undo as if ourself were here
queen margaret what will your highness leave the parliament
king henry vi ay margaret my heart is drown'd with grief
 whose flood begins to flow within mine eyes
 my body round engirt with misery
 for what's more miserable than discontent
 ah uncle humphrey in thy face i see
 the map of honour truth and loyalty
 and yet good humphrey is the hour to come
 that e'er i proved thee false or fear'd thy faith
 what louring star now envies thy estate
 that these great lords and margaret our queen
 do seek subversion of thy harmless life
 thou never didst them wrong nor no man wrong
 and as the butcher takes away the calf
 and binds the wretch and beats it when it strays
 bearing it to the bloody slaughterhouse
 even so remorseless have they borne him hence
 and as the dam runs lowing up and down
 looking the way her harmless young one went
 and can do nought but wail her darling's loss
 even so myself bewails good gloucester's case
 with sad unhelpful tears and with dimm'd eyes
 look after him and cannot do him good
 so mighty are his vowed enemies
 his fortunes i will weep and twixt each groan
 say who's a traitor gloucester he is none'
 exeunt all but queen margaret cardinal
 suffolk and york somerset remains apart
queen margaret free lords cold snow melts with the sun's hot beams
 henry my lord is cold in great affairs
 too full of foolish pity and gloucester's show
 beguiles him as the mournful crocodile
 with sorrow snares relenting passengers
 or as the snake roll'd in a flowering bank
 with shining chequer'd slough doth sting a child
 that for the beauty thinks it excellent
 believe me lords were none more wise than i
 and yet herein i judge mine own wit good
 this gloucester should be quickly rid the world
 to rid us of the fear we have of him
cardinal that he should die is worthy policy
 but yet we want a colour for his death
 tis meet he be condemn'd by course of law
suffolk but in my mind that were no policy
 the king will labour still to save his life
 the commons haply rise to save his life
 and yet we have but trivial argument
 more than mistrust that shows him worthy death
york so that by this you would not have him die
suffolk ah york no man alive so fain as i
york tis york that hath more reason for his death
 but my lord cardinal and you my lord of suffolk
 say as you think and speak it from your souls
 were't not all one an empty eagle were set
 to guard the chicken from a hungry kite
 as place duke humphrey for the king's protector
queen margaret so the poor chicken should be sure of death
suffolk madam tis true and were't not madness then
 to make the fox surveyor of the fold
 who being accused a crafty murderer
 his guilt should be but idly posted over
 because his purpose is not executed
 no let him die in that he is a fox
 by nature proved an enemy to the flock
 before his chaps be stain'd with crimson blood
 as humphrey proved by reasons to my liege
 and do not stand on quillets how to slay him
 be it by gins by snares by subtlety
 sleeping or waking tis no matter how
 so he be dead for that is good deceit
 which mates him first that first intends deceit
queen margaret thricenoble suffolk tis resolutely spoke
suffolk not resolute except so much were done
 for things are often spoke and seldom meant
 but that my heart accordeth with my tongue
 seeing the deed is meritorious
 and to preserve my sovereign from his foe
 say but the word and i will be his priest
cardinal but i would have him dead my lord of suffolk
 ere you can take due orders for a priest
 say you consent and censure well the deed
 and i'll provide his executioner
 i tender so the safety of my liege
suffolk here is my hand the deed is worthy doing
queen margaret and so say i
york and i and now we three have spoke it
 it skills not greatly who impugns our doom
 enter a post
post great lords from ireland am i come amain
 to signify that rebels there are up
 and put the englishmen unto the sword
 send succors lords and stop the rage betime
 before the wound do grow uncurable
 for being green there is great hope of help
cardinal a breach that craves a quick expedient stop
 what counsel give you in this weighty cause
york that somerset be sent as regent thither
 tis meet that lucky ruler be employ'd
 witness the fortune he hath had in france
somerset if york with all his farfet policy
