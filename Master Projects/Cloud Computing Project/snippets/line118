at that time herod the tetrarch heard of the fame of jesus
and said unto his servants this is john the baptist he is risen from the dead and therefore mighty works do shew forth themselves in him
for herod had laid hold on john and bound him and put him in prison for herodias sake his brother philip's wife
for john said unto him it is not lawful for thee to have her
and when he would have put him to death he feared the multitude because they counted him as a prophet
but when herod's birthday was kept the daughter of herodias danced before them and pleased herod
whereupon he promised with an oath to give her whatsoever she would ask
and she being before instructed of her mother said give me here john baptist's head in a charger
and the king was sorry nevertheless for the oath's sake and them which sat with him at meat he commanded it to be given her
and he sent and beheaded john in the prison
and his head was brought in a charger and given to the damsel and she brought it to her mother
and his disciples came and took up the body and buried it and went and told jesus
when jesus heard of it he departed thence by ship into a desert place apart and when the people had heard thereof they followed him on foot out of the cities
and jesus went forth and saw a great multitude and was moved with compassion toward them and he healed their sick
and when it was evening his disciples came to him saying this is a desert place and the time is now past send the multitude away that they may go into the villages and buy themselves victuals
but jesus said unto them they need not depart give ye them to eat
and they say unto him we have here but five loaves and two fishes
he said bring them hither to me
and he commanded the multitude to sit down on the grass and took the five loaves and the two fishes and looking up to heaven he blessed and brake and gave the loaves to his disciples and the disciples to the multitude
and they did all eat and were filled and they took up of the fragments that remained twelve baskets full
and they that had eaten were about five thousand men beside women and children
and straightway jesus constrained his disciples to get into a ship and to go before him unto the other side while he sent the multitudes away
and when he had sent the multitudes away he went up into a mountain apart to pray and when the evening was come he was there alone
but the ship was now in the midst of the sea tossed with waves for the wind was contrary
and in the fourth watch of the night jesus went unto them walking on the sea
and when the disciples saw him walking on the sea they were troubled saying it is a spirit and they cried out for fear
but straightway jesus spake unto them saying be of good cheer it is i be not afraid
and peter answered him and said lord if it be thou bid me come unto thee on the water
and he said come and when peter was come down out of the ship he walked on the water to go to jesus
but when he saw the wind boisterous he was afraid and beginning to sink he cried saying lord save me
and immediately jesus stretched forth his hand and caught him and said unto him o thou of little faith wherefore didst thou doubt
and when they were come into the ship the wind ceased
then they that were in the ship came and worshipped him saying of a truth thou art the son of god
and when they were gone over they came into the land of gennesaret
and when the men of that place had knowledge of him they sent out into all that country round about and brought unto him all that were diseased
and besought him that they might only touch the hem of his garment and as many as touched were made perfectly whole
then came to jesus scribes and pharisees which were of jerusalem saying
why do thy disciples transgress the tradition of the elders for they wash not their hands when they eat bread
but he answered and said unto them why do ye also transgress the commandment of god by your tradition
for god commanded saying honour thy father and mother and he that curseth father or mother let him die the death
but ye say whosoever shall say to his father or his mother it is a gift by whatsoever thou mightest be profited by me
and honour not his father or his mother he shall be free thus have ye made the commandment of god of none effect by your tradition
ye hypocrites well did esaias prophesy of you saying
this people draweth nigh unto me with their mouth and honoureth me with their lips but their heart is far from me
but in vain they do worship me teaching for doctrines the commandments of men
and he called the multitude and said unto them hear and understand
not that which goeth into the mouth defileth a man but that which cometh out of the mouth this defileth a man
then came his disciples and said unto him knowest thou that the pharisees were offended after they heard this saying
but he answered and said every plant which my heavenly father hath not planted shall be rooted up
let them alone they be blind leaders of the blind and if the blind lead the blind both shall fall into the ditch
then answered peter and said unto him declare unto us this parable
and jesus said are ye also yet without understanding
do not ye yet understand that whatsoever entereth in at the mouth goeth into the belly and is cast out into the draught
but those things which proceed out of the mouth come forth from the heart and they defile the man
for out of the heart proceed evil thoughts murders adulteries fornications thefts false witness blasphemies
these are the things which defile a man but to eat with unwashen hands defileth not a man
then jesus went thence and departed into the coasts of tyre and sidon
and behold a woman of canaan came out of the same coasts and cried unto him saying have mercy on me o lord thou son of david my daughter is grievously vexed with a devil
but he answered her not a word and his disciples came and besought him saying send her away for she crieth after us
but he answered and said i am not sent but unto the lost sheep of the house of israel
then came she and worshipped him saying lord help me
but he answered and said it is not meet to take the children's bread and to cast it to dogs
and she said truth lord yet the dogs eat of the crumbs which fall from their masters table
then jesus answered and said unto her o woman great is thy faith be it unto thee even as thou wilt and her daughter was made whole from that very hour
and jesus departed from thence and came nigh unto the sea of galilee and went up into a mountain and sat down there
and great multitudes came unto him having with them those that were lame blind dumb maimed and many others and cast them down at jesus feet and he healed them
insomuch that the multitude wondered when they saw the dumb to speak the maimed to be whole the lame to walk and the blind to see and they glorified the god of israel
then jesus called his disciples unto him and said i have compassion on the multitude because they continue with me now three days and have nothing to eat and i will not send them away fasting lest they faint in the way
and his disciples say unto him whence should we have so much bread in the wilderness as to fill so great a multitude
and jesus saith unto them how many loaves have ye and they said seven and a few little fishes
and he commanded the multitude to sit down on the ground
and he took the seven loaves and the fishes and gave thanks and brake them and gave to his disciples and the disciples to the multitude
and they did all eat and were filled and they took up of the broken meat that was left seven baskets full
and they that did eat were four thousand men beside women and children
and he sent away the multitude and took ship and came into the coasts of magdala
the pharisees also with the sadducees came and tempting desired him that he would shew them a sign from heaven
he answered and said unto them when it is evening ye say it will be fair weather for the sky is red
and in the morning it will be foul weather to day for the sky is red and lowring o ye hypocrites ye can discern the face of the sky but can ye not discern the signs of the times
a wicked and adulterous generation seeketh after a sign and there shall no sign be given unto it but the sign of the prophet jonas and he left them and departed
and when his disciples were come to the other side they had forgotten to take bread
then jesus said unto them take heed and beware of the leaven of the pharisees and of the sadducees
and they reasoned among themselves saying it is because we have taken no bread
which when jesus perceived he said unto them o ye of little faith why reason ye among yourselves because ye have brought no bread
do ye not yet understand neither remember the five loaves of the five thousand and how many baskets ye took up
neither the seven loaves of the four thousand and how many baskets ye took up
how is it that ye do not understand that i spake it not to you concerning bread that ye should beware of the leaven of the pharisees and of the sadducees
then understood they how that he bade them not beware of the leaven of bread but of the doctrine of the pharisees and of the sadducees
when jesus came into the coasts of caesarea philippi he asked his disciples saying whom do men say that i the son of man am
and they said some say that thou art john the baptist some elias and others jeremias or one of the prophets
he saith unto them but whom say ye that i am
and simon peter answered and said thou art the christ the son of the living god
and jesus answered and said unto him blessed art thou simon barjona for flesh and blood hath not revealed it unto thee but my father which is in heaven
and i say also unto thee that thou art peter and upon this rock i will build my church and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it
and i will give unto thee the keys of the kingdom of heaven and whatsoever thou shalt bind on earth shall be bound in heaven and whatsoever thou shalt loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven
then charged he his disciples that they should tell no man that he was jesus the christ
from that time forth began jesus to shew unto his disciples how that he must go unto jerusalem and suffer many things of the elders and chief priests and scribes and be killed and be raised again the third day
then peter took him and began to rebuke him saying be it far from thee lord this shall not be unto thee
but he turned and said unto peter get thee behind me satan thou art an offence unto me for thou savourest not the things that be of god but those that be of men
then said jesus unto his disciples if any man will come after me let him deny himself and take up his cross and follow me
for whosoever will save his life shall lose it and whosoever will lose his life for my sake shall find it
for what is a man profited if he shall gain the whole world and lose his own soul or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul
for the son of man shall come in the glory of his father with his angels and then he shall reward every man according to his works
verily i say unto you there be some standing here which shall not taste of death till they see the son of man coming in his kingdom
and after six days jesus taketh peter james and john his brother and bringeth them up into an high mountain apart
and was transfigured before them and his face did shine as the sun and his raiment was white as the light
and behold there appeared unto them moses and elias talking with him
then answered peter and said unto jesus lord it is good for us to be here if thou wilt let us make here three tabernacles one for thee and one for moses and one for elias
while he yet spake behold a bright cloud overshadowed them and behold a voice out of the cloud which said this is my beloved son in whom i am well pleased hear ye him
and when the disciples heard it they fell on their face and were sore afraid
and jesus came and touched them and said arise and be not afraid
and when they had lifted up their eyes they saw no man save jesus only
and as they came down from the mountain jesus charged them saying tell the vision to no man until the son of man be risen again from the dead
and his disciples asked him saying why then say the scribes that elias must first come
and jesus answered and said unto them elias truly shall first come and restore all things
but i say unto you that elias is come already and they knew him not but have done unto him whatsoever they listed likewise shall also the son of man suffer of them
then the disciples understood that he spake unto them of john the baptist
and when they were come to the multitude there came to him a certain man kneeling down to him and saying
lord have mercy on my son for he is lunatick and sore vexed for ofttimes he falleth into the fire and oft into the water
and i brought him to thy disciples and they could not cure him
then jesus answered and said o faithless and perverse generation how long shall i be with you how long shall i suffer you bring him hither to me
and jesus rebuked the devil and he departed out of him and the child was cured from that very hour
then came the disciples to jesus apart and said why could not we cast him out
and jesus said unto them because of your unbelief for verily i say unto you if ye have faith as a grain of mustard seed ye shall say unto this mountain remove hence to yonder place and it shall remove and nothing shall be impossible unto you
howbeit this kind goeth not out but by prayer and fasting
and while they abode in galilee jesus said unto them the son of man shall be betrayed into the hands of men
and they shall kill him and the third day he shall be raised again and they were exceeding sorry
and when they were come to capernaum they that received tribute money came to peter and said doth not your master pay tribute
he saith yes and when he was come into the house jesus prevented him saying what thinkest thou simon of whom do the kings of the earth take custom or tribute of their own children or of strangers
peter saith unto him of strangers jesus saith unto him then are the children free
notwithstanding lest we should offend them go thou to the sea and cast an hook and take up the fish that first cometh up and when thou hast opened his mouth thou shalt find a piece of money that take and give unto them for me and thee
at the same time came the disciples unto jesus saying who is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven
and jesus called a little child unto him and set him in the midst of them
and said verily i say unto you except ye be converted and become as little children ye shall not enter into the kingdom of heaven
whosoever therefore shall humble himself as this little child the same is greatest in the kingdom of heaven
and whoso shall receive one such little child in my name receiveth me
but whoso shall offend one of these little ones which believe in me it were better for him that a millstone were hanged about his neck and that he were drowned in the depth of the sea
woe unto the world because of offences for it must needs be that offences come but woe to that man by whom the offence cometh
wherefore if thy hand or thy foot offend thee cut them off and cast them from thee it is better for thee to enter into life halt or maimed rather than having two hands or two feet to be cast into everlasting fire
and if thine eye offend thee pluck it out and cast it from thee it is better for thee to enter into life with one eye rather than having two eyes to be cast into hell fire
take heed that ye despise not one of these little ones for i say unto you that in heaven their angels do always behold the face of my father which is in heaven
for the son of man is come to save that which was lost
how think ye if a man have an hundred sheep and one of them be gone astray doth he not leave the ninety and nine and goeth into the mountains and seeketh that which is gone astray
and if so be that he find it verily i say unto you he rejoiceth more of that sheep than of the ninety and nine which went not astray
even so it is not the will of your father which is in heaven that one of these little ones should perish
moreover if thy brother shall trespass against thee go and tell him his fault between thee and him alone if he shall hear thee thou hast gained thy brother
but if he will not hear thee then take with thee one or two more that in the mouth of two or three witnesses every word may be established
and if he shall neglect to hear them tell it unto the church but if he neglect to hear the church let him be unto thee as an heathen man and a publican
verily i say unto you whatsoever ye shall bind on earth shall be bound in heaven and whatsoever ye shall loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven
again i say unto you that if two of you shall agree on earth as touching any thing that they shall ask it shall be done for them of my father which is in heaven
for where two or three are gathered together in my name there am i in the midst of them
then came peter to him and said lord how oft shall my brother sin against me and i forgive him till seven times
jesus saith unto him i say not unto thee until seven times but until seventy times seven
therefore is the kingdom of heaven likened unto a certain king which would take account of his servants
and when he had begun to reckon one was brought unto him which owed him ten thousand talents
but forasmuch as he had not to pay his lord commanded him to be sold and his wife and children and all that he had and payment to be made
the servant therefore fell down and worshipped him saying lord have patience with me and i will pay thee all
then the lord of that servant was moved with compassion and loosed him and forgave him the debt
but the same servant went out and found one of his fellowservants which owed him an hundred pence and he laid hands on him and took him by the throat saying pay me that thou owest
and his fellowservant fell down at his feet and besought him saying have patience with me and i will pay thee all
and he would not but went and cast him into prison till he should pay the debt
so when his fellowservants saw what was done they were very sorry and came and told unto their lord all that was done
then his lord after that he had called him said unto him o thou wicked servant i forgave thee all that debt because thou desiredst me
shouldest not thou also have had compassion on thy fellowservant even as i had pity on thee
and his lord was wroth and delivered him to the tormentors till he should pay all that was due unto him
so likewise shall my heavenly father do also unto you if ye from your hearts forgive not every one his brother their trespasses
and it came to pass that when jesus had finished these sayings he departed from galilee and came into the coasts of judaea beyond jordan
and great multitudes followed him and he healed them there
the pharisees also came unto him tempting him and saying unto him is it lawful for a man to put away his wife for every cause
and he answered and said unto them have ye not read that he which made them at the beginning made them male and female
and said for this cause shall a man leave father and mother and shall cleave to his wife and they twain shall be one flesh
wherefore they are no more twain but one flesh what therefore god hath joined together let not man put asunder
they say unto him why did moses then command to give a writing of divorcement and to put her away
he saith unto them moses because of the hardness of your hearts suffered you to put away your wives but from the beginning it was not so
and i say unto you whosoever shall put away his wife except it be for fornication and shall marry another committeth adultery and whoso marrieth her which is put away doth commit adultery
his disciples say unto him if the case of the man be so with his wife it is not good to marry
but he said unto them all men cannot receive this saying save they to whom it is given
for there are some eunuchs which were so born from their mother's womb and there are some eunuchs which were made eunuchs of men and there be eunuchs which have made themselves eunuchs for the kingdom of heaven's sake he that is able to receive it let him receive it
then were there brought unto him little children that he should put his hands on them and pray and the disciples rebuked them
but jesus said suffer little children and forbid them not to come unto me for of such is the kingdom of heaven
and he laid his hands on them and departed thence
and behold one came and said unto him good master what good thing shall i do that i may have eternal life
and he said unto him why callest thou me good there is none good but one that is god but if thou wilt enter into life keep the commandments
he saith unto him which jesus said thou shalt do no murder thou shalt not commit adultery thou shalt not steal thou shalt not bear false witness
honour thy father and thy mother and thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself
the young man saith unto him all these things have i kept from my youth up what lack i yet
jesus said unto him if thou wilt be perfect go and sell that thou hast and give to the poor and thou shalt have treasure in heaven and come and follow me
but when the young man heard that saying he went away sorrowful for he had great possessions
then said jesus unto his disciples verily i say unto you that a rich man shall hardly enter into the kingdom of heaven
and again i say unto you it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of god
when his disciples heard it they were exceedingly amazed saying who then can be saved
but jesus beheld them and said unto them with men this is impossible but with god all things are possible
then answered peter and said unto him behold we have forsaken all and followed thee what shall we have therefore
and jesus said unto them verily i say unto you that ye which have followed me in the regeneration when the son of man shall sit in the throne of his glory ye also shall sit upon twelve thrones judging the twelve tribes of israel
and every one that hath forsaken houses or brethren or sisters or father or mother or wife or children or lands for my name's sake shall receive an hundredfold and shall inherit everlasting life
but many that are first shall be last and the last shall be first
for the kingdom of heaven is like unto a man that is an householder which went out early in the morning to hire labourers into his vineyard
and when he had agreed with the labourers for a penny a day he sent them into his vineyard
and he went out about the third hour and saw others standing idle in the marketplace
and said unto them go ye also into the vineyard and whatsoever is right i will give you and they went their way
again he went out about the sixth and ninth hour and did likewise
