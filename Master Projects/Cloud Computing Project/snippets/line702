 king henry v
act iii
scene iii the same before the gates
 the governor and some citizens on the walls the
 english forces below enter king henry and his train
king henry v how yet resolves the governor of the town
 this is the latest parle we will admit
 therefore to our best mercy give yourselves
 or like to men proud of destruction
 defy us to our worst for as i am a soldier
 a name that in my thoughts becomes me best
 if i begin the battery once again
 i will not leave the halfachieved harfleur
 till in her ashes she lie buried
 the gates of mercy shall be all shut up
 and the flesh'd soldier rough and hard of heart
 in liberty of bloody hand shall range
 with conscience wide as hell mowing like grass
 your freshfair virgins and your flowering infants
 what is it then to me if impious war
 array'd in flames like to the prince of fiends
 do with his smirch'd complexion all fell feats
 enlink'd to waste and desolation
 what is't to me when you yourselves are cause
 if your pure maidens fall into the hand
 of hot and forcing violation
 what rein can hold licentious wickedness
 when down the hill he holds his fierce career
 we may as bootless spend our vain command
 upon the enraged soldiers in their spoil
 as send precepts to the leviathan
 to come ashore therefore you men of harfleur
 take pity of your town and of your people
 whiles yet my soldiers are in my command
 whiles yet the cool and temperate wind of grace
 o'erblows the filthy and contagious clouds
 of heady murder spoil and villany
 if not why in a moment look to see
 the blind and bloody soldier with foul hand
 defile the locks of your shrillshrieking daughters
 your fathers taken by the silver beards
 and their most reverend heads dash'd to the walls
 your naked infants spitted upon pikes
 whiles the mad mothers with their howls confused
 do break the clouds as did the wives of jewry
 at herod's bloodyhunting slaughtermen
 what say you will you yield and this avoid
 or guilty in defence be thus destroy'd
governor our expectation hath this day an end
 the dauphin whom of succors we entreated
 returns us that his powers are yet not ready
 to raise so great a siege therefore great king
 we yield our town and lives to thy soft mercy
 enter our gates dispose of us and ours
 for we no longer are defensible
king henry v open your gates come uncle exeter
 go you and enter harfleur there remain
 and fortify it strongly gainst the french
 use mercy to them all for us dear uncle
 the winter coming on and sickness growing
 upon our soldiers we will retire to calais
 tonight in harfleur we will be your guest
 tomorrow for the march are we addrest
 flourish the king and his train enter the town
