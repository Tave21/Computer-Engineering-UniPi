2chr297 also they have shut up the doors of the porch and put out the lamps and have not burned incense nor offered burnt offerings in the holy place unto the god of israel
2chr298 wherefore the wrath of the lord was upon judah and jerusalem and he hath delivered them to trouble to astonishment and to hissing as ye see with your eyes
2chr299 for lo our fathers have fallen by the sword and our sons and our daughters and our wives are in captivity for this
2chr2910 now it is in mine heart to make a covenant with the lord god of israel that his fierce wrath may turn away from us
2chr2911 my sons be not now negligent for the lord hath chosen you to stand before him to serve him and that ye should minister unto him and burn incense
2chr2912 then the levites arose mahath the son of amasai and joel the son of azariah of the sons of the kohathites and of the sons of merari kish the son of abdi and azariah the son of jehalelel and of the gershonites joah the son of zimmah and eden the son of joah
2chr2913 and of the sons of elizaphan shimri and jeiel and of the sons of asaph zechariah and mattaniah
2chr2914 and of the sons of heman jehiel and shimei and of the sons of jeduthun shemaiah and uzziel
2chr2915 and they gathered their brethren and sanctified themselves and came according to the commandment of the king by the words of the lord to cleanse the house of the lord
2chr2916 and the priests went into the inner part of the house of the lord to cleanse it and brought out all the uncleanness that they found in the temple of the lord into the court of the house of the lord and the levites took it to carry it out abroad into the brook kidron
2chr2917 now they began on the first day of the first month to sanctify and on the eighth day of the month came they to the porch of the lord so they sanctified the house of the lord in eight days and in the sixteenth day of the first month they made an end
2chr2918 then they went in to hezekiah the king and said we have cleansed all the house of the lord and the altar of burnt offering with all the vessels thereof and the shewbread table with all the vessels thereof
2chr2919 moreover all the vessels which king ahaz in his reign did cast away in his transgression have we prepared and sanctified and behold they are before the altar of the lord
2chr2920 then hezekiah the king rose early and gathered the rulers of the city and went up to the house of the lord
2chr2921 and they brought seven bullocks and seven rams and seven lambs and seven he goats for a sin offering for the kingdom and for the sanctuary and for judah and he commanded the priests the sons of aaron to offer them on the altar of the lord
2chr2922 so they killed the bullocks and the priests received the blood and sprinkled it on the altar likewise when they had killed the rams they sprinkled the blood upon the altar they killed also the lambs and they sprinkled the blood upon the altar
2chr2923 and they brought forth the he goats for the sin offering before the king and the congregation and they laid their hands upon them
2chr2924 and the priests killed them and they made reconciliation with their blood upon the altar to make an atonement for all israel for the king commanded that the burnt offering and the sin offering should be made for all israel
2chr2925 and he set the levites in the house of the lord with cymbals with psalteries and with harps according to the commandment of david and of gad the king's seer and nathan the prophet for so was the commandment of the lord by his prophets
2chr2926 and the levites stood with the instruments of david and the priests with the trumpets
2chr2927 and hezekiah commanded to offer the burnt offering upon the altar and when the burnt offering began the song of the lord began also with the trumpets and with the instruments ordained by david king of israel
2chr2928 and all the congregation worshipped and the singers sang and the trumpeters sounded and all this continued until the burnt offering was finished
2chr2929 and when they had made an end of offering the king and all that were present with him bowed themselves and worshipped
2chr2930 moreover hezekiah the king and the princes commanded the levites to sing praise unto the lord with the words of david and of asaph the seer and they sang praises with gladness and they bowed their heads and worshipped
2chr2931 then hezekiah answered and said now ye have consecrated yourselves unto the lord come near and bring sacrifices and thank offerings into the house of the lord and the congregation brought in sacrifices and thank offerings and as many as were of a free heart burnt offerings
2chr2932 and the number of the burnt offerings which the congregation brought was threescore and ten bullocks an hundred rams and two hundred lambs all these were for a burnt offering to the lord
2chr2933 and the consecrated things were six hundred oxen and three thousand sheep
2chr2934 but the priests were too few so that they could not flay all the burnt offerings wherefore their brethren the levites did help them till the work was ended and until the other priests had sanctified themselves for the levites were more upright in heart to sanctify themselves than the priests
2chr2935 and also the burnt offerings were in abundance with the fat of the peace offerings and the drink offerings for every burnt offering so the service of the house of the lord was set in order
2chr2936 and hezekiah rejoiced and all the people that god had prepared the people for the thing was done suddenly
2chr301 and hezekiah sent to all israel and judah and wrote letters also to ephraim and manasseh that they should come to the house of the lord at jerusalem to keep the passover unto the lord god of israel
2chr302 for the king had taken counsel and his princes and all the congregation in jerusalem to keep the passover in the second month
2chr303 for they could not keep it at that time because the priests had not sanctified themselves sufficiently neither had the people gathered themselves together to jerusalem
2chr304 and the thing pleased the king and all the congregation
2chr305 so they established a decree to make proclamation throughout all israel from beersheba even to dan that they should come to keep the passover unto the lord god of israel at jerusalem for they had not done it of a long time in such sort as it was written
2chr306 so the posts went with the letters from the king and his princes throughout all israel and judah and according to the commandment of the king saying ye children of israel turn again unto the lord god of abraham isaac and israel and he will return to the remnant of you that are escaped out of the hand of the kings of assyria
2chr307 and be not ye like your fathers and like your brethren which trespassed against the lord god of their fathers who therefore gave them up to desolation as ye see
2chr308 now be ye not stiffnecked as your fathers were but yield yourselves unto the lord and enter into his sanctuary which he hath sanctified for ever and serve the lord your god that the fierceness of his wrath may turn away from you
2chr309 for if ye turn again unto the lord your brethren and your children shall find compassion before them that lead them captive so that they shall come again into this land for the lord your god is gracious and merciful and will not turn away his face from you if ye return unto him
2chr3010 so the posts passed from city to city through the country of ephraim and manasseh even unto zebulun but they laughed them to scorn and mocked them
2chr3011 nevertheless divers of asher and manasseh and of zebulun humbled themselves and came to jerusalem
2chr3012 also in judah the hand of god was to give them one heart to do the commandment of the king and of the princes by the word of the lord
2chr3013 and there assembled at jerusalem much people to keep the feast of unleavened bread in the second month a very great congregation
2chr3014 and they arose and took away the altars that were in jerusalem and all the altars for incense took they away and cast them into the brook kidron
2chr3015 then they killed the passover on the fourteenth day of the second month and the priests and the levites were ashamed and sanctified themselves and brought in the burnt offerings into the house of the lord
2chr3016 and they stood in their place after their manner according to the law of moses the man of god the priests sprinkled the blood which they received of the hand of the levites
2chr3017 for there were many in the congregation that were not sanctified therefore the levites had the charge of the killing of the passovers for every one that was not clean to sanctify them unto the lord
2chr3018 for a multitude of the people even many of ephraim and manasseh issachar and zebulun had not cleansed themselves yet did they eat the passover otherwise than it was written but hezekiah prayed for them saying the good lord pardon every one
2chr3019 that prepareth his heart to seek god the lord god of his fathers though he be not cleansed according to the purification of the sanctuary
2chr3020 and the lord hearkened to hezekiah and healed the people
2chr3021 and the children of israel that were present at jerusalem kept the feast of unleavened bread seven days with great gladness and the levites and the priests praised the lord day by day singing with loud instruments unto the lord
2chr3022 and hezekiah spake comfortably unto all the levites that taught the good knowledge of the lord and they did eat throughout the feast seven days offering peace offerings and making confession to the lord god of their fathers
2chr3023 and the whole assembly took counsel to keep other seven days and they kept other seven days with gladness
2chr3024 for hezekiah king of judah did give to the congregation a thousand bullocks and seven thousand sheep and the princes gave to the congregation a thousand bullocks and ten thousand sheep and a great number of priests sanctified themselves
2chr3025 and all the congregation of judah with the priests and the levites and all the congregation that came out of israel and the strangers that came out of the land of israel and that dwelt in judah rejoiced
2chr3026 so there was great joy in jerusalem for since the time of solomon the son of david king of israel there was not the like in jerusalem
2chr3027 then the priests the levites arose and blessed the people and their voice was heard and their prayer came up to his holy dwelling place even unto heaven
2chr311 now when all this was finished all israel that were present went out to the cities of judah and brake the images in pieces and cut down the groves and threw down the high places and the altars out of all judah and benjamin in ephraim also and manasseh until they had utterly destroyed them all then all the children of israel returned every man to his possession into their own cities
2chr312 and hezekiah appointed the courses of the priests and the levites after their courses every man according to his service the priests and levites for burnt offerings and for peace offerings to minister and to give thanks and to praise in the gates of the tents of the lord
2chr313 he appointed also the king's portion of his substance for the burnt offerings to wit for the morning and evening burnt offerings and the burnt offerings for the sabbaths and for the new moons and for the set feasts as it is written in the law of the lord
2chr314 moreover he commanded the people that dwelt in jerusalem to give the portion of the priests and the levites that they might be encouraged in the law of the lord
2chr315 and as soon as the commandment came abroad the children of israel brought in abundance the firstfruits of corn wine and oil and honey and of all the increase of the field and the tithe of all things brought they in abundantly
2chr316 and concerning the children of israel and judah that dwelt in the cities of judah they also brought in the tithe of oxen and sheep and the tithe of holy things which were consecrated unto the lord their god and laid them by heaps
2chr317 in the third month they began to lay the foundation of the heaps and finished them in the seventh month
2chr318 and when hezekiah and the princes came and saw the heaps they blessed the lord and his people israel
2chr319 then hezekiah questioned with the priests and the levites concerning the heaps
2chr3110 and azariah the chief priest of the house of zadok answered him and said since the people began to bring the offerings into the house of the lord we have had enough to eat and have left plenty for the lord hath blessed his people and that which is left is this great store
2chr3111 then hezekiah commanded to prepare chambers in the house of the lord and they prepared them
2chr3112 and brought in the offerings and the tithes and the dedicated things faithfully over which cononiah the levite was ruler and shimei his brother was the next
2chr3113 and jehiel and azaziah and nahath and asahel and jerimoth and jozabad and eliel and ismachiah and mahath and benaiah were overseers under the hand of cononiah and shimei his brother at the commandment of hezekiah the king and azariah the ruler of the house of god
2chr3114 and kore the son of imnah the levite the porter toward the east was over the freewill offerings of god to distribute the oblations of the lord and the most holy things
2chr3115 and next him were eden and miniamin and jeshua and shemaiah amariah and shecaniah in the cities of the priests in their set office to give to their brethren by courses as well to the great as to the small
2chr3116 beside their genealogy of males from three years old and upward even unto every one that entereth into the house of the lord his daily portion for their service in their charges according to their courses
2chr3117 both to the genealogy of the priests by the house of their fathers and the levites from twenty years old and upward in their charges by their courses
2chr3118 and to the genealogy of all their little ones their wives and their sons and their daughters through all the congregation for in their set office they sanctified themselves in holiness
2chr3119 also of the sons of aaron the priests which were in the fields of the suburbs of their cities in every several city the men that were expressed by name to give portions to all the males among the priests and to all that were reckoned by genealogies among the levites
2chr3120 and thus did hezekiah throughout all judah and wrought that which was good and right and truth before the lord his god
2chr3121 and in every work that he began in the service of the house of god and in the law and in the commandments to seek his god he did it with all his heart and prospered
2chr321 after these things and the establishment thereof sennacherib king of assyria came and entered into judah and encamped against the fenced cities and thought to win them for himself
2chr322 and when hezekiah saw that sennacherib was come and that he was purposed to fight against jerusalem
2chr323 he took counsel with his princes and his mighty men to stop the waters of the fountains which were without the city and they did help him
2chr324 so there was gathered much people together who stopped all the fountains and the brook that ran through the midst of the land saying why should the kings of assyria come and find much water
2chr325 also he strengthened himself and built up all the wall that was broken and raised it up to the towers and another wall without and repaired millo in the city of david and made darts and shields in abundance
2chr326 and he set captains of war over the people and gathered them together to him in the street of the gate of the city and spake comfortably to them saying
2chr327 be strong and courageous be not afraid nor dismayed for the king of assyria nor for all the multitude that is with him for there be more with us than with him
2chr328 with him is an arm of flesh but with us is the lord our god to help us and to fight our battles and the people rested themselves upon the words of hezekiah king of judah
2chr329 after this did sennacherib king of assyria send his servants to jerusalem but he himself laid siege against lachish and all his power with him unto hezekiah king of judah and unto all judah that were at jerusalem saying
2chr3210 thus saith sennacherib king of assyria whereon do ye trust that ye abide in the siege in jerusalem
2chr3211 doth not hezekiah persuade you to give over yourselves to die by famine and by thirst saying the lord our god shall deliver us out of the hand of the king of assyria
2chr3212 hath not the same hezekiah taken away his high places and his altars and commanded judah and jerusalem saying ye shall worship before one altar and burn incense upon it
2chr3213 know ye not what i and my fathers have done unto all the people of other lands were the gods of the nations of those lands any ways able to deliver their lands out of mine hand
2chr3214 who was there among all the gods of those nations that my fathers utterly destroyed that could deliver his people out of mine hand that your god should be able to deliver you out of mine hand
2chr3215 now therefore let not hezekiah deceive you nor persuade you on this manner neither yet believe him for no god of any nation or kingdom was able to deliver his people out of mine hand and out of the hand of my fathers how much less shall your god deliver you out of mine hand
2chr3216 and his servants spake yet more against the lord god and against his servant hezekiah
2chr3217 he wrote also letters to rail on the lord god of israel and to speak against him saying as the gods of the nations of other lands have not delivered their people out of mine hand so shall not the god of hezekiah deliver his people out of mine hand
2chr3218 then they cried with a loud voice in the jews speech unto the people of jerusalem that were on the wall to affright them and to trouble them that they might take the city
2chr3219 and they spake against the god of jerusalem as against the gods of the people of the earth which were the work of the hands of man
2chr3220 and for this cause hezekiah the king and the prophet isaiah the son of amoz prayed and cried to heaven
2chr3221 and the lord sent an angel which cut off all the mighty men of valour and the leaders and captains in the camp of the king of assyria so he returned with shame of face to his own land and when he was come into the house of his god they that came forth of his own bowels slew him there with the sword
2chr3222 thus the lord saved hezekiah and the inhabitants of jerusalem from the hand of sennacherib the king of assyria and from the hand of all other and guided them on every side
2chr3223 and many brought gifts unto the lord to jerusalem and presents to hezekiah king of judah so that he was magnified in the sight of all nations from thenceforth
2chr3224 in those days hezekiah was sick to the death and prayed unto the lord and he spake unto him and he gave him a sign
2chr3225 but hezekiah rendered not again according to the benefit done unto him for his heart was lifted up therefore there was wrath upon him and upon judah and jerusalem
2chr3226 notwithstanding hezekiah humbled himself for the pride of his heart both he and the inhabitants of jerusalem so that the wrath of the lord came not upon them in the days of hezekiah
2chr3227 and hezekiah had exceeding much riches and honour and he made himself treasuries for silver and for gold and for precious stones and for spices and for shields and for all manner of pleasant jewels
2chr3228 storehouses also for the increase of corn and wine and oil and stalls for all manner of beasts and cotes for flocks
2chr3229 moreover he provided him cities and possessions of flocks and herds in abundance for god had given him substance very much
2chr3230 this same hezekiah also stopped the upper watercourse of gihon and brought it straight down to the west side of the city of david and hezekiah prospered in all his works
2chr3231 howbeit in the business of the ambassadors of the princes of babylon who sent unto him to enquire of the wonder that was done in the land god left him to try him that he might know all that was in his heart
2chr3232 now the rest of the acts of hezekiah and his goodness behold they are written in the vision of isaiah the prophet the son of amoz and in the book of the kings of judah and israel
2chr3233 and hezekiah slept with his fathers and they buried him in the chiefest of the sepulchres of the sons of david and all judah and the inhabitants of jerusalem did him honour at his death and manasseh his son reigned in his stead
2chr331 manasseh was twelve years old when he began to reign and he reigned fifty and five years in jerusalem
2chr332 but did that which was evil in the sight of the lord like unto the abominations of the heathen whom the lord had cast out before the children of israel
2chr333 for he built again the high places which hezekiah his father had broken down and he reared up altars for baalim and made groves and worshipped all the host of heaven and served them
2chr334 also he built altars in the house of the lord whereof the lord had said in jerusalem shall my name be for ever
2chr335 and he built altars for all the host of heaven in the two courts of the house of the lord
2chr336 and he caused his children to pass through the fire in the valley of the son of hinnom also he observed times and used enchantments and used witchcraft and dealt with a familiar spirit and with wizards he wrought much evil in the sight of the lord to provoke him to anger
2chr337 and he set a carved image the idol which he had made in the house of god of which god had said to david and to solomon his son in this house and in jerusalem which i have chosen before all the tribes of israel will i put my name for ever
2chr338 neither will i any more remove the foot of israel from out of the land which i have appointed for your fathers so that they will take heed to do all that i have commanded them according to the whole law and the statutes and the ordinances by the hand of moses
2chr339 so manasseh made judah and the inhabitants of jerusalem to err and to do worse than the heathen whom the lord had destroyed before the children of israel
2chr3310 and the lord spake to manasseh and to his people but they would not hearken
2chr3311 wherefore the lord brought upon them the captains of the host of the king of assyria which took manasseh among the thorns and bound him with fetters and carried him to babylon
2chr3312 and when he was in affliction he besought the lord his god and humbled himself greatly before the god of his fathers
2chr3313 and prayed unto him and he was intreated of him and heard his supplication and brought him again to jerusalem into his kingdom then manasseh knew that the lord he was god
2chr3314 now after this he built a wall without the city of david on the west side of gihon in the valley even to the entering in at the fish gate and compassed about ophel and raised it up a very great height and put captains of war in all the fenced cities of judah
2chr3315 and he took away the strange gods and the idol out of the house of the lord and all the altars that he had built in the mount of the house of the lord and in jerusalem and cast them out of the city
2chr3316 and he repaired the altar of the lord and sacrificed thereon peace offerings and thank offerings and commanded judah to serve the lord god of israel
2chr3317 nevertheless the people did sacrifice still in the high places yet unto the lord their god only
2chr3318 now the rest of the acts of manasseh and his prayer unto his god and the words of the seers that spake to him in the name of the lord god of israel behold they are written in the book of the kings of israel
2chr3319 his prayer also and how god was intreated of him and all his sins and his trespass and the places wherein he built high places and set up groves and graven images before he was humbled behold they are written among the sayings of the seers
2chr3320 so manasseh slept with his fathers and they buried him in his own house and amon his son reigned in his stead
2chr3321 amon was two and twenty years old when he began to reign and reigned two years in jerusalem
2chr3322 but he did that which was evil in the sight of the lord as did manasseh his father for amon sacrificed unto all the carved images which manasseh his father had made and served them
2chr3323 and humbled not himself before the lord as manasseh his father had humbled himself but amon trespassed more and more
2chr3324 and his servants conspired against him and slew him in his own house
2chr3325 but the people of the land slew all them that had conspired against king amon and the people of the land made josiah his son king in his stead
2chr341 josiah was eight years old when he began to reign and he reigned in jerusalem one and thirty years
2chr342 and he did that which was right in the sight of the lord and walked in the ways of david his father and declined neither to the right hand nor to the left
2chr343 for in the eighth year of his reign while he was yet young he began to seek after the god of david his father and in the twelfth year he began to purge judah and jerusalem from the high places and the groves and the carved images and the molten images
2chr344 and they brake down the altars of baalim in his presence and the images that were on high above them he cut down and the groves and the carved images and the molten images he brake in pieces and made dust of them and strowed it upon the graves of them that had sacrificed unto them
2chr345 and he burnt the bones of the priests upon their altars and cleansed judah and jerusalem
2chr346 and so did he in the cities of manasseh and ephraim and simeon even unto naphtali with their mattocks round about
2chr347 and when he had broken down the altars and the groves and had beaten the graven images into powder and cut down all the idols throughout all the land of israel he returned to jerusalem
2chr348 now in the eighteenth year of his reign when he had purged the land and the house he sent shaphan the son of azaliah and maaseiah the governor of the city and joah the son of joahaz the recorder to repair the house of the lord his god
2chr349 and when they came to hilkiah the high priest they delivered the money that was brought into the house of god which the levites that kept the doors had gathered of the hand of manasseh and ephraim and of all the remnant of israel and of all judah and benjamin and they returned to jerusalem
2chr3410 and they put it in the hand of the workmen that had the oversight of the house of the lord and they gave it to the workmen that wrought in the house of the lord to repair and amend the house
2chr3411 even to the artificers and builders gave they it to buy hewn stone and timber for couplings and to floor the houses which the kings of judah had destroyed
2chr3412 and the men did the work faithfully and the overseers of them were jahath and obadiah the levites of the sons of merari and zechariah and meshullam of the sons of the kohathites to set it forward and other of the levites all that could skill of instruments of musick
2chr3413 also they were over the bearers of burdens and were overseers of all that wrought the work in any manner of service and of the levites there were scribes and officers and porters
2chr3414 and when they brought out the money that was brought into the house of the lord hilkiah the priest found a book of the law of the lord given by moses
2chr3415 and hilkiah answered and said to shaphan the scribe i have found the book of the law in the house of the lord and hilkiah delivered the book to shaphan
2chr3416 and shaphan carried the book to the king and brought the king word back again saying all that was committed to thy servants they do it
2chr3417 and they have gathered together the money that was found in the house of the lord and have delivered it into the hand of the overseers and to the hand of the workmen
2chr3418 then shaphan the scribe told the king saying hilkiah the priest hath given me a book and shaphan read it before the king
2chr3419 and it came to pass when the king had heard the words of the law that he rent his clothes
2chr3420 and the king commanded hilkiah and ahikam the son of shaphan and abdon the son of micah and shaphan the scribe and asaiah a servant of the king's saying
2chr3421 go enquire of the lord for me and for them that are left in israel and in judah concerning the words of the book that is found for great is the wrath of the lord that is poured out upon us because our fathers have not kept the word of the lord to do after all that is written in this book
2chr3422 and hilkiah and they that the king had appointed went to huldah the prophetess the wife of shallum the son of tikvath the son of hasrah keeper of the wardrobe now she dwelt in jerusalem in the college and they spake to her to that effect
2chr3423 and she answered them thus saith the lord god of israel tell ye the man that sent you to me
2chr3424 thus saith the lord behold i will bring evil upon this place and upon the inhabitants thereof even all the curses that are written in the book which they have read before the king of judah
2chr3425 because they have forsaken me and have burned incense unto other gods that they might provoke me to anger with all the works of their hands therefore my wrath shall be poured out upon this place and shall not be quenched
2chr3426 and as for the king of judah who sent you to enquire of the lord so shall ye say unto him thus saith the lord god of israel concerning the words which thou hast heard
2chr3427 because thine heart was tender and thou didst humble thyself before god when thou heardest his words against this place and against the inhabitants thereof and humbledst thyself before me and didst rend thy clothes and weep before me i have even heard thee also saith the lord
2chr3428 behold i will gather thee to thy fathers and thou shalt be gathered to thy grave in peace neither shall thine eyes see all the evil that i will bring upon this place and upon the inhabitants of the same so they brought the king word again
2chr3429 then the king sent and gathered together all the elders of judah and jerusalem
2chr3430 and the king went up into the house of the lord and all the men of judah and the inhabitants of jerusalem and the priests and the levites and all the people great and small and he read in their ears all the words of the book of the covenant that was found in the house of the lord
2chr3431 and the king stood in his place and made a covenant before the lord to walk after the lord and to keep his commandments and his testimonies and his statutes with all his heart and with all his soul to perform the words of the covenant which are written in this book
2chr3432 and he caused all that were present in jerusalem and benjamin to stand to it and the inhabitants of jerusalem did according to the covenant of god the god of their fathers
2chr3433 and josiah took away all the abominations out of all the countries that pertained to the children of israel and made all that were present in israel to serve even to serve the lord their god and all his days they departed not from following the lord the god of their fathers
2chr351 moreover josiah kept a passover unto the lord in jerusalem and they killed the passover on the fourteenth day of the first month
2chr352 and he set the priests in their charges and encouraged them to the service of the house of the lord
2chr353 and said unto the levites that taught all israel which were holy unto the lord put the holy ark in the house which solomon the son of david king of israel did build it shall not be a burden upon your shoulders serve now the lord your god and his people israel
2chr354 and prepare yourselves by the houses of your fathers after your courses according to the writing of david king of israel and according to the writing of solomon his son
2chr355 and stand in the holy place according to the divisions of the families of the fathers of your brethren the people and after the division of the families of the levites
2chr356 so kill the passover and sanctify yourselves and prepare your brethren that they may do according to the word of the lord by the hand of moses
2chr357 and josiah gave to the people of the flock lambs and kids all for the passover offerings for all that were present to the number of thirty thousand and three thousand bullocks these were of the king's substance
2chr358 and his princes gave willingly unto the people to the priests and to the levites hilkiah and zechariah and jehiel rulers of the house of god gave unto the priests for the passover offerings two thousand and six hundred small cattle and three hundred oxen
2chr359 conaniah also and shemaiah and nethaneel his brethren and hashabiah and jeiel and jozabad chief of the levites gave unto the levites for passover offerings five thousand small cattle and five hundred oxen
2chr3510 so the service was prepared and the priests stood in their place and the levites in their courses according to the king's commandment
2chr3511 and they killed the passover and the priests sprinkled the blood from their hands and the levites flayed them
2chr3512 and they removed the burnt offerings that they might give according to the divisions of the families of the people to offer unto the lord as it is written in the book of moses and so did they with the oxen
2chr3513 and they roasted the passover with fire according to the ordinance but the other holy offerings sod they in pots and in caldrons and in pans and divided them speedily among all the people
2chr3514 and afterward they made ready for themselves and for the priests because the priests the sons of aaron were busied in offering of burnt offerings and the fat until night therefore the levites prepared for themselves and for the priests the sons of aaron
2chr3515 and the singers the sons of asaph were in their place according to the commandment of david and asaph and heman and jeduthun the king's seer and the porters waited at every gate they might not depart from their service for their brethren the levites prepared for them
2chr3516 so all the service of the lord was prepared the same day to keep the passover and to offer burnt offerings upon the altar of the lord according to the commandment of king josiah
2chr3517 and the children of israel that were present kept the passover at that time and the feast of unleavened bread seven days
2chr3518 and there was no passover like to that kept in israel from the days of samuel the prophet neither did all the kings of israel keep such a passover as josiah kept and the priests and the levites and all judah and israel that were present and the inhabitants of jerusalem
2chr3519 in the eighteenth year of the reign of josiah was this passover kept
2chr3520 after all this when josiah had prepared the temple necho king of egypt came up to fight against charchemish by euphrates and josiah went out against him
2chr3521 but he sent ambassadors to him saying what have i to do with thee thou king of judah i come not against thee this day but against the house wherewith i have war for god commanded me to make haste forbear thee from meddling with god who is with me that he destroy thee not
2chr3522 nevertheless josiah would not turn his face from him but disguised himself that he might fight with him and hearkened not unto the words of necho from the mouth of god and came to fight in the valley of megiddo
2chr3523 and the archers shot at king josiah and the king said to his servants have me away for i am sore wounded
2chr3524 his servants therefore took him out of that chariot and put him in the second chariot that he had and they brought him to jerusalem and he died and was buried in one of the sepulchres of his fathers and all judah and jerusalem mourned for josiah
2chr3525 and jeremiah lamented for josiah and all the singing men and the singing women spake of josiah in their lamentations to this day and made them an ordinance in israel and behold they are written in the lamentations
2chr3526 now the rest of the acts of josiah and his goodness according to that which was written in the law of the lord
2chr3527 and his deeds first and last behold they are written in the book of the kings of israel and judah
2chr361 then the people of the land took jehoahaz the son of josiah and made him king in his father's stead in jerusalem
2chr362 jehoahaz was twenty and three years old when he began to reign and he reigned three months in jerusalem
2chr363 and the king of egypt put him down at jerusalem and condemned the land in an hundred talents of silver and a talent of gold
2chr364 and the king of egypt made eliakim his brother king over judah and jerusalem and turned his name to jehoiakim and necho took jehoahaz his brother and carried him to egypt
