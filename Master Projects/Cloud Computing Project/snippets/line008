and i am sure that the king of egypt will not let you go no not by a mighty hand
and i will stretch out my hand and smite egypt with all my wonders which i will do in the midst thereof and after that he will let you go
and i will give this people favour in the sight of the egyptians and it shall come to pass that when ye go ye shall not go empty
but every woman shall borrow of her neighbour and of her that sojourneth in her house jewels of silver and jewels of gold and raiment and ye shall put them upon your sons and upon your daughters and ye shall spoil the egyptians
and moses answered and said but behold they will not believe me nor hearken unto my voice for they will say the lord hath not appeared unto thee
and the lord said unto him what is that in thine hand and he said a rod
and he said cast it on the ground and he cast it on the ground and it became a serpent and moses fled from before it
and the lord said unto moses put forth thine hand and take it by the tail and he put forth his hand and caught it and it became a rod in his hand
that they may believe that the lord god of their fathers the god of abraham the god of isaac and the god of jacob hath appeared unto thee
and the lord said furthermore unto him put now thine hand into thy bosom and he put his hand into his bosom and when he took it out behold his hand was leprous as snow
and he said put thine hand into thy bosom again and he put his hand into his bosom again and plucked it out of his bosom and behold it was turned again as his other flesh
and it shall come to pass if they will not believe thee neither hearken to the voice of the first sign that they will believe the voice of the latter sign
and it shall come to pass if they will not believe also these two signs neither hearken unto thy voice that thou shalt take of the water of the river and pour it upon the dry land and the water which thou takest out of the river shall become blood upon the dry land
and moses said unto the lord o my lord i am not eloquent neither heretofore nor since thou hast spoken unto thy servant but i am slow of speech and of a slow tongue
and the lord said unto him who hath made man's mouth or who maketh the dumb or deaf or the seeing or the blind have not i the lord
now therefore go and i will be with thy mouth and teach thee what thou shalt say
and he said o my lord send i pray thee by the hand of him whom thou wilt send
and the anger of the lord was kindled against moses and he said is not aaron the levite thy brother i know that he can speak well and also behold he cometh forth to meet thee and when he seeth thee he will be glad in his heart
and thou shalt speak unto him and put words in his mouth and i will be with thy mouth and with his mouth and will teach you what ye shall do
and he shall be thy spokesman unto the people and he shall be even he shall be to thee instead of a mouth and thou shalt be to him instead of god
and thou shalt take this rod in thine hand wherewith thou shalt do signs
and moses went and returned to jethro his father in law and said unto him let me go i pray thee and return unto my brethren which are in egypt and see whether they be yet alive and jethro said to moses go in peace
and the lord said unto moses in midian go return into egypt for all the men are dead which sought thy life
and moses took his wife and his sons and set them upon an ass and he returned to the land of egypt and moses took the rod of god in his hand
and the lord said unto moses when thou goest to return into egypt see that thou do all those wonders before pharaoh which i have put in thine hand but i will harden his heart that he shall not let the people go
and thou shalt say unto pharaoh thus saith the lord israel is my son even my firstborn
and i say unto thee let my son go that he may serve me and if thou refuse to let him go behold i will slay thy son even thy firstborn
and it came to pass by the way in the inn that the lord met him and sought to kill him
then zipporah took a sharp stone and cut off the foreskin of her son and cast it at his feet and said surely a bloody husband art thou to me
so he let him go then she said a bloody husband thou art because of the circumcision
and the lord said to aaron go into the wilderness to meet moses and he went and met him in the mount of god and kissed him
and moses told aaron all the words of the lord who had sent him and all the signs which he had commanded him
and moses and aaron went and gathered together all the elders of the children of israel
and aaron spake all the words which the lord had spoken unto moses and did the signs in the sight of the people
and the people believed and when they heard that the lord had visited the children of israel and that he had looked upon their affliction then they bowed their heads and worshipped
and afterward moses and aaron went in and told pharaoh thus saith the lord god of israel let my people go that they may hold a feast unto me in the wilderness
and pharaoh said who is the lord that i should obey his voice to let israel go i know not the lord neither will i let israel go
and they said the god of the hebrews hath met with us let us go we pray thee three days journey into the desert and sacrifice unto the lord our god lest he fall upon us with pestilence or with the sword
and the king of egypt said unto them wherefore do ye moses and aaron let the people from their works get you unto your burdens
and pharaoh said behold the people of the land now are many and ye make them rest from their burdens
and pharaoh commanded the same day the taskmasters of the people and their officers saying
ye shall no more give the people straw to make brick as heretofore let them go and gather straw for themselves
and the tale of the bricks which they did make heretofore ye shall lay upon them ye shall not diminish ought thereof for they be idle therefore they cry saying let us go and sacrifice to our god
let there more work be laid upon the men that they may labour therein and let them not regard vain words
and the taskmasters of the people went out and their officers and they spake to the people saying thus saith pharaoh i will not give you straw
go ye get you straw where ye can find it yet not ought of your work shall be diminished
so the people were scattered abroad throughout all the land of egypt to gather stubble instead of straw
and the taskmasters hasted them saying fulfil your works your daily tasks as when there was straw
and the officers of the children of israel which pharaoh's taskmasters had set over them were beaten and demanded wherefore have ye not fulfilled your task in making brick both yesterday and to day as heretofore
then the officers of the children of israel came and cried unto pharaoh saying wherefore dealest thou thus with thy servants
there is no straw given unto thy servants and they say to us make brick and behold thy servants are beaten but the fault is in thine own people
but he said ye are idle ye are idle therefore ye say let us go and do sacrifice to the lord
go therefore now and work for there shall no straw be given you yet shall ye deliver the tale of bricks
and the officers of the children of israel did see that they were in evil case after it was said ye shall not minish ought from your bricks of your daily task
and they met moses and aaron who stood in the way as they came forth from pharaoh
and they said unto them the lord look upon you and judge because ye have made our savour to be abhorred in the eyes of pharaoh and in the eyes of his servants to put a sword in their hand to slay us
and moses returned unto the lord and said lord wherefore hast thou so evil entreated this people why is it that thou hast sent me
for since i came to pharaoh to speak in thy name he hath done evil to this people neither hast thou delivered thy people at all
then the lord said unto moses now shalt thou see what i will do to pharaoh for with a strong hand shall he let them go and with a strong hand shall he drive them out of his land
and god spake unto moses and said unto him i am the lord
and i appeared unto abraham unto isaac and unto jacob by the name of god almighty but by my name jehovah was i not known to them
and i have also established my covenant with them to give them the land of canaan the land of their pilgrimage wherein they were strangers
and i have also heard the groaning of the children of israel whom the egyptians keep in bondage and i have remembered my covenant
wherefore say unto the children of israel i am the lord and i will bring you out from under the burdens of the egyptians and i will rid you out of their bondage and i will redeem you with a stretched out arm and with great judgments
and i will take you to me for a people and i will be to you a god and ye shall know that i am the lord your god which bringeth you out from under the burdens of the egyptians
and i will bring you in unto the land concerning the which i did swear to give it to abraham to isaac and to jacob and i will give it you for an heritage i am the lord
and moses spake so unto the children of israel but they hearkened not unto moses for anguish of spirit and for cruel bondage
and the lord spake unto moses saying
go in speak unto pharaoh king of egypt that he let the children of israel go out of his land
and moses spake before the lord saying behold the children of israel have not hearkened unto me how then shall pharaoh hear me who am of uncircumcised lips
and the lord spake unto moses and unto aaron and gave them a charge unto the children of israel and unto pharaoh king of egypt to bring the children of israel out of the land of egypt
these be the heads of their fathers houses the sons of reuben the firstborn of israel hanoch and pallu hezron and carmi these be the families of reuben
and the sons of simeon jemuel and jamin and ohad and jachin and zohar and shaul the son of a canaanitish woman these are the families of simeon
and these are the names of the sons of levi according to their generations gershon and kohath and merari and the years of the life of levi were an hundred thirty and seven years
the sons of gershon libni and shimi according to their families
and the sons of kohath amram and izhar and hebron and uzziel and the years of the life of kohath were an hundred thirty and three years
and the sons of merari mahali and mushi these are the families of levi according to their generations
and amram took him jochebed his father's sister to wife and she bare him aaron and moses and the years of the life of amram were an hundred and thirty and seven years
and the sons of izhar korah and nepheg and zichri
and the sons of uzziel mishael and elzaphan and zithri
and aaron took him elisheba daughter of amminadab sister of naashon to wife and she bare him nadab and abihu eleazar and ithamar
and the sons of korah assir and elkanah and abiasaph these are the families of the korhites
and eleazar aaron's son took him one of the daughters of putiel to wife and she bare him phinehas these are the heads of the fathers of the levites according to their families
these are that aaron and moses to whom the lord said bring out the children of israel from the land of egypt according to their armies
these are they which spake to pharaoh king of egypt to bring out the children of israel from egypt these are that moses and aaron
and it came to pass on the day when the lord spake unto moses in the land of egypt
that the lord spake unto moses saying i am the lord speak thou unto pharaoh king of egypt all that i say unto thee
and moses said before the lord behold i am of uncircumcised lips and how shall pharaoh hearken unto me
and the lord said unto moses see i have made thee a god to pharaoh and aaron thy brother shall be thy prophet
thou shalt speak all that i command thee and aaron thy brother shall speak unto pharaoh that he send the children of israel out of his land
and i will harden pharaoh's heart and multiply my signs and my wonders in the land of egypt
but pharaoh shall not hearken unto you that i may lay my hand upon egypt and bring forth mine armies and my people the children of israel out of the land of egypt by great judgments
and the egyptians shall know that i am the lord when i stretch forth mine hand upon egypt and bring out the children of israel from among them
and moses and aaron did as the lord commanded them so did they
and moses was fourscore years old and aaron fourscore and three years old when they spake unto pharaoh
and the lord spake unto moses and unto aaron saying
when pharaoh shall speak unto you saying shew a miracle for you then thou shalt say unto aaron take thy rod and cast it before pharaoh and it shall become a serpent
and moses and aaron went in unto pharaoh and they did so as the lord had commanded and aaron cast down his rod before pharaoh and before his servants and it became a serpent
then pharaoh also called the wise men and the sorcerers now the magicians of egypt they also did in like manner with their enchantments
for they cast down every man his rod and they became serpents but aaron's rod swallowed up their rods
and he hardened pharaoh's heart that he hearkened not unto them as the lord had said
and the lord said unto moses pharaoh's heart is hardened he refuseth to let the people go
get thee unto pharaoh in the morning lo he goeth out unto the water and thou shalt stand by the river's brink against he come and the rod which was turned to a serpent shalt thou take in thine hand
and thou shalt say unto him the lord god of the hebrews hath sent me unto thee saying let my people go that they may serve me in the wilderness and behold hitherto thou wouldest not hear
thus saith the lord in this thou shalt know that i am the lord behold i will smite with the rod that is in mine hand upon the waters which are in the river and they shall be turned to blood
and the fish that is in the river shall die and the river shall stink and the egyptians shall lothe to drink of the water of the river
and the lord spake unto moses say unto aaron take thy rod and stretch out thine hand upon the waters of egypt upon their streams upon their rivers and upon their ponds and upon all their pools of water that they may become blood and that there may be blood throughout all the land of egypt both in vessels of wood and in vessels of stone
and moses and aaron did so as the lord commanded and he lifted up the rod and smote the waters that were in the river in the sight of pharaoh and in the sight of his servants and all the waters that were in the river were turned to blood
and the fish that was in the river died and the river stank and the egyptians could not drink of the water of the river and there was blood throughout all the land of egypt
and the magicians of egypt did so with their enchantments and pharaoh's heart was hardened neither did he hearken unto them as the lord had said
and pharaoh turned and went into his house neither did he set his heart to this also
and all the egyptians digged round about the river for water to drink for they could not drink of the water of the river
and seven days were fulfilled after that the lord had smitten the river
and the lord spake unto moses go unto pharaoh and say unto him thus saith the lord let my people go that they may serve me
and if thou refuse to let them go behold i will smite all thy borders with frogs
and the river shall bring forth frogs abundantly which shall go up and come into thine house and into thy bedchamber and upon thy bed and into the house of thy servants and upon thy people and into thine ovens and into thy kneadingtroughs
and the frogs shall come up both on thee and upon thy people and upon all thy servants
and the lord spake unto moses say unto aaron stretch forth thine hand with thy rod over the streams over the rivers and over the ponds and cause frogs to come up upon the land of egypt
and aaron stretched out his hand over the waters of egypt and the frogs came up and covered the land of egypt
and the magicians did so with their enchantments and brought up frogs upon the land of egypt
then pharaoh called for moses and aaron and said intreat the lord that he may take away the frogs from me and from my people and i will let the people go that they may do sacrifice unto the lord
and moses said unto pharaoh glory over me when shall i intreat for thee and for thy servants and for thy people to destroy the frogs from thee and thy houses that they may remain in the river only
and he said to morrow and he said be it according to thy word that thou mayest know that there is none like unto the lord our god
and the frogs shall depart from thee and from thy houses and from thy servants and from thy people they shall remain in the river only
and moses and aaron went out from pharaoh and moses cried unto the lord because of the frogs which he had brought against pharaoh
and the lord did according to the word of moses and the frogs died out of the houses out of the villages and out of the fields
and they gathered them together upon heaps and the land stank
but when pharaoh saw that there was respite he hardened his heart and hearkened not unto them as the lord had said
and the lord said unto moses say unto aaron stretch out thy rod and smite the dust of the land that it may become lice throughout all the land of egypt
and they did so for aaron stretched out his hand with his rod and smote the dust of the earth and it became lice in man and in beast all the dust of the land became lice throughout all the land of egypt
and the magicians did so with their enchantments to bring forth lice but they could not so there were lice upon man and upon beast
then the magicians said unto pharaoh this is the finger of god and pharaoh's heart was hardened and he hearkened not unto them as the lord had said
and the lord said unto moses rise up early in the morning and stand before pharaoh lo he cometh forth to the water and say unto him thus saith the lord let my people go that they may serve me
else if thou wilt not let my people go behold i will send swarms of flies upon thee and upon thy servants and upon thy people and into thy houses and the houses of the egyptians shall be full of swarms of flies and also the ground whereon they are
and i will sever in that day the land of goshen in which my people dwell that no swarms of flies shall be there to the end thou mayest know that i am the lord in the midst of the earth
and i will put a division between my people and thy people to morrow shall this sign be
and the lord did so and there came a grievous swarm of flies into the house of pharaoh and into his servants houses and into all the land of egypt the land was corrupted by reason of the swarm of flies
and pharaoh called for moses and for aaron and said go ye sacrifice to your god in the land
and moses said it is not meet so to do for we shall sacrifice the abomination of the egyptians to the lord our god lo shall we sacrifice the abomination of the egyptians before their eyes and will they not stone us
we will go three days journey into the wilderness and sacrifice to the lord our god as he shall command us
and pharaoh said i will let you go that ye may sacrifice to the lord your god in the wilderness only ye shall not go very far away intreat for me
and moses said behold i go out from thee and i will intreat the lord that the swarms of flies may depart from pharaoh from his servants and from his people to morrow but let not pharaoh deal deceitfully any more in not letting the people go to sacrifice to the lord
and moses went out from pharaoh and intreated the lord
and the lord did according to the word of moses and he removed the swarms of flies from pharaoh from his servants and from his people there remained not one
and pharaoh hardened his heart at this time also neither would he let the people go
then the lord said unto moses go in unto pharaoh and tell him thus saith the lord god of the hebrews let my people go that they may serve me
for if thou refuse to let them go and wilt hold them still
behold the hand of the lord is upon thy cattle which is in the field upon the horses upon the asses upon the camels upon the oxen and upon the sheep there shall be a very grievous murrain
and the lord shall sever between the cattle of israel and the cattle of egypt and there shall nothing die of all that is the children's of israel
and the lord appointed a set time saying to morrow the lord shall do this thing in the land
and the lord did that thing on the morrow and all the cattle of egypt died but of the cattle of the children of israel died not one
and pharaoh sent and behold there was not one of the cattle of the israelites dead and the heart of pharaoh was hardened and he did not let the people go
and the lord said unto moses and unto aaron take to you handfuls of ashes of the furnace and let moses sprinkle it toward the heaven in the sight of pharaoh
and it shall become small dust in all the land of egypt and shall be a boil breaking forth with blains upon man and upon beast throughout all the land of egypt
and they took ashes of the furnace and stood before pharaoh and moses sprinkled it up toward heaven and it became a boil breaking forth with blains upon man and upon beast
and the magicians could not stand before moses because of the boils for the boil was upon the magicians and upon all the egyptians
and the lord hardened the heart of pharaoh and he hearkened not unto them as the lord had spoken unto moses
and the lord said unto moses rise up early in the morning and stand before pharaoh and say unto him thus saith the lord god of the hebrews let my people go that they may serve me
for i will at this time send all my plagues upon thine heart and upon thy servants and upon thy people that thou mayest know that there is none like me in all the earth
for now i will stretch out my hand that i may smite thee and thy people with pestilence and thou shalt be cut off from the earth
and in very deed for this cause have i raised thee up for to shew in thee my power and that my name may be declared throughout all the earth
as yet exaltest thou thyself against my people that thou wilt not let them go
behold to morrow about this time i will cause it to rain a very grievous hail such as hath not been in egypt since the foundation thereof even until now
send therefore now and gather thy cattle and all that thou hast in the field for upon every man and beast which shall be found in the field and shall not be brought home the hail shall come down upon them and they shall die
he that feared the word of the lord among the servants of pharaoh made his servants and his cattle flee into the houses
and he that regarded not the word of the lord left his servants and his cattle in the field
and the lord said unto moses stretch forth thine hand toward heaven that there may be hail in all the land of egypt upon man and upon beast and upon every herb of the field throughout the land of egypt
and moses stretched forth his rod toward heaven and the lord sent thunder and hail and the fire ran along upon the ground and the lord rained hail upon the land of egypt
so there was hail and fire mingled with the hail very grievous such as there was none like it in all the land of egypt since it became a nation
and the hail smote throughout all the land of egypt all that was in the field both man and beast and the hail smote every herb of the field and brake every tree of the field
only in the land of goshen where the children of israel were was there no hail
and pharaoh sent and called for moses and aaron and said unto them i have sinned this time the lord is righteous and i and my people are wicked
intreat the lord for it is enough that there be no more mighty thunderings and hail and i will let you go and ye shall stay no longer
and moses said unto him as soon as i am gone out of the city i will spread abroad my hands unto the lord and the thunder shall cease neither shall there be any more hail that thou mayest know how that the earth is the lord's
but as for thee and thy servants i know that ye will not yet fear the lord god
and the flax and the barley was smitten for the barley was in the ear and the flax was bolled
but the wheat and the rie were not smitten for they were not grown up
and moses went out of the city from pharaoh and spread abroad his hands unto the lord and the thunders and hail ceased and the rain was not poured upon the earth
and when pharaoh saw that the rain and the hail and the thunders were ceased he sinned yet more and hardened his heart he and his servants
and the heart of pharaoh was hardened neither would he let the children of israel go as the lord had spoken by moses
and the lord said unto moses go in unto pharaoh for i have hardened his heart and the heart of his servants that i might shew these my signs before him
and that thou mayest tell in the ears of thy son and of thy son's son what things i have wrought in egypt and my signs which i have done among them that ye may know how that i am the lord
and moses and aaron came in unto pharaoh and said unto him thus saith the lord god of the hebrews how long wilt thou refuse to humble thyself before me let my people go that they may serve me
else if thou refuse to let my people go behold to morrow will i bring the locusts into thy coast
and they shall cover the face of the earth that one cannot be able to see the earth and they shall eat the residue of that which is escaped which remaineth unto you from the hail and shall eat every tree which groweth for you out of the field
and they shall fill thy houses and the houses of all thy servants and the houses of all the egyptians which neither thy fathers nor thy fathers fathers have seen since the day that they were upon the earth unto this day and he turned himself and went out from pharaoh
and pharaoh's servants said unto him how long shall this man be a snare unto us let the men go that they may serve the lord their god knowest thou not yet that egypt is destroyed
and moses and aaron were brought again unto pharaoh and he said unto them go serve the lord your god but who are they that shall go
and moses said we will go with our young and with our old with our sons and with our daughters with our flocks and with our herds will we go for we must hold a feast unto the lord
and he said unto them let the lord be so with you as i will let you go and your little ones look to it for evil is before you
not so go now ye that are men and serve the lord for that ye did desire and they were driven out from pharaoh's presence
and the lord said unto moses stretch out thine hand over the land of egypt for the locusts that they may come up upon the land of egypt and eat every herb of the land even all that the hail hath left
and moses stretched forth his rod over the land of egypt and the lord brought an east wind upon the land all that day and all that night and when it was morning the east wind brought the locusts
and the locusts went up over all the land of egypt and rested in all the coasts of egypt very grievous were they before them there were no such locusts as they neither after them shall be such
for they covered the face of the whole earth so that the land was darkened and they did eat every herb of the land and all the fruit of the trees which the hail had left and there remained not any green thing in the trees or in the herbs of the field through all the land of egypt
then pharaoh called for moses and aaron in haste and he said i have sinned against the lord your god and against you
now therefore forgive i pray thee my sin only this once and intreat the lord your god that he may take away from me this death only
and he went out from pharaoh and intreated the lord
and the lord turned a mighty strong west wind which took away the locusts and cast them into the red sea there remained not one locust in all the coasts of egypt
but the lord hardened pharaoh's heart so that he would not let the children of israel go
