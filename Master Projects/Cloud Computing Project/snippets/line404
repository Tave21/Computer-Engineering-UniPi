 to draw upon an exile o brave sir
 i would they were in afric both together

 the goerback why came you from your master
pisanio on his command he would not suffer me
 to bring him to the haven left these notes
 of what commands i should be subject to
 when t pleased you to employ me

scene ii the same a public place
 enter cloten and two lords
first lord sir i would advise you to shift a shirt the
 violence of action hath made you reek as a
 sacrifice where air comes out air comes in
 there's none abroad so wholesome as that you vent
cloten if my shirt were bloody then to shift it have i hurt him
second lord aside no faith not so much as his patience
first lord hurt him his body's a passable carcass if he be
 not hurt it is a thoroughfare for steel if it be not hurt
second lord aside his steel was in debt it went o the
 backside the town
cloten the villain would not stand me
second lord aside no but he fled forward still toward your face
first lord stand you you have land enough of your own but
 he added to your having gave you some ground
second lord aside as many inches as you have oceans puppies
cloten i would they had not come between us
second lord aside so would i till you had measured how long
 a fool you were upon the ground
cloten and that she should love this fellow and refuse me
second lord aside if it be a sin to make a true election she
 is damned
first lord sir as i told you always her beauty and her brain
 go not together she's a good sign but i have seen
 small reflection of her wit
second lord aside she shines not upon fools lest the
 reflection should hurt her
cloten come i'll to my chamber would there had been some
 hurt done
second lord aside i wish not so unless it had been the fall
 of an ass which is no great hurt
cloten you'll go with us
first lord i'll attend your lordship
cloten nay come let's go together
second lord well my lord

scene iii a room in cymbeline's palace
 enter imogen and pisanio
imogen i would thou grew'st unto the shores o the haven
 and question'dst every sail if he should write
 and not have it twere a paper lost
 as offer'd mercy is what was the last
 that he spake to thee
pisanio it was his queen his queen
imogen then waved his handkerchief
pisanio and kiss'd it madam
imogen senseless linen happier therein than i
 and that was all
pisanio no madam for so long
 as he could make me with this eye or ear
 distinguish him from others he did keep
 the deck with glove or hat or handkerchief
 still waving as the fits and stirs of s mind
 could best express how slow his soul sail'd on
 how swift his ship
imogen thou shouldst have made him
 as little as a crow or less ere left
 to aftereye him
pisanio madam so i did
imogen i would have broke mine eyestrings crack'd them but
 to look upon him till the diminution
 of space had pointed him sharp as my needle
 nay follow'd him till he had melted from
 the smallness of a gnat to air and then
 have turn'd mine eye and wept but good pisanio
 when shall we hear from him
pisanio be assured madam
 with his next vantage
imogen i did not take my leave of him but had
 most pretty things to say ere i could tell him
 how i would think on him at certain hours
 such thoughts and such or i could make him swear
 the shes of italy should not betray
 mine interest and his honour or have charged him
 at the sixth hour of morn at noon at midnight
 to encounter me with orisons for then
 i am in heaven for him or ere i could
 give him that parting kiss which i had set
 betwixt two charming words comes in my father
 and like the tyrannous breathing of the north
 shakes all our buds from growing
 enter a lady
lady the queen madam
 desires your highness company
imogen those things i bid you do get them dispatch'd
 i will attend the queen
pisanio madam i shall

scene iv rome philario's house
 enter philario iachimo a frenchman a
 dutchman and a spaniard
iachimo believe it sir i have seen him in britain he was
 then of a crescent note expected to prove so worthy
 as since he hath been allowed the name of but i
 could then have looked on him without the help of
 admiration though the catalogue of his endowments
 had been tabled by his side and i to peruse him by items
philario you speak of him when he was less furnished than now
 he is with that which makes him both without and within
frenchman i have seen him in france we had very many there
 could behold the sun with as firm eyes as he
iachimo this matter of marrying his king's daughter wherein
 he must be weighed rather by her value than his own
 words him i doubt not a great deal from the matter
frenchman and then his banishment
iachimo ay and the approbation of those that weep this
 lamentable divorce under her colours are wonderfully
 to extend him be it but to fortify her judgment
 which else an easy battery might lay flat for
 taking a beggar without less quality but how comes
 it he is to sojourn with you how creeps
 acquaintance
philario his father and i were soldiers together to whom i
 have been often bound for no less than my life
 here comes the briton let him be so entertained
 amongst you as suits with gentlemen of your
 knowing to a stranger of his quality
 enter posthumus leonatus
 i beseech you all be better known to this
 gentleman whom i commend to you as a noble friend
 of mine how worthy he is i will leave to appear
 hereafter rather than story him in his own hearing
frenchman sir we have known together in orleans
posthumus leonatus since when i have been debtor to you for courtesies
 which i will be ever to pay and yet pay still
frenchman sir you o'errate my poor kindness i was glad i
 did atone my countryman and you it had been pity
 you should have been put together with so mortal a
 purpose as then each bore upon importance of so
 slight and trivial a nature
posthumus leonatus by your pardon sir i was then a young traveller
 rather shunned to go even with what i heard than in
 my every action to be guided by others experiences
 but upon my mended judgmentif i offend not to say
 it is mendedmy quarrel was not altogether slight
frenchman faith yes to be put to the arbitrement of swords
 and by such two that would by all likelihood have
 confounded one the other or have fallen both
iachimo can we with manners ask what was the difference
frenchman safely i think twas a contention in public
 which may without contradiction suffer the report
 it was much like an argument that fell out last
 night where each of us fell in praise of our
 country mistresses this gentleman at that time
 vouchingand upon warrant of bloody
 affirmationhis to be more fair virtuous wise
 chaste constantqualified and less attemptable
 than any the rarest of our ladies in france
iachimo that lady is not now living or this gentleman's
 opinion by this worn out
posthumus leonatus she holds her virtue still and i my mind
iachimo you must not so far prefer her fore ours of italy
posthumus leonatus being so far provoked as i was in france i would
 abate her nothing though i profess myself her
 adorer not her friend
iachimo as fair and as gooda kind of handinhand
 comparisonhad been something too fair and too good
 for any lady in britain if she went before others
 i have seen as that diamond of yours outlustres
 many i have beheld i could not but believe she
 excelled many but i have not seen the most
 precious diamond that is nor you the lady
posthumus leonatus i praised her as i rated her so do i my stone
iachimo what do you esteem it at
posthumus leonatus more than the world enjoys
iachimo either your unparagoned mistress is dead or she's
 outprized by a trifle
posthumus leonatus you are mistaken the one may be sold or given if
 there were wealth enough for the purchase or merit
 for the gift the other is not a thing for sale
 and only the gift of the gods
iachimo which the gods have given you
posthumus leonatus which by their graces i will keep
iachimo you may wear her in title yours but you know
 strange fowl light upon neighbouring ponds your
 ring may be stolen too so your brace of unprizable
