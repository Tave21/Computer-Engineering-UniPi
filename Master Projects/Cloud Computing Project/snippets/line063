the levites in the days of eliashib joiada and johanan and jaddua were recorded chief of the fathers also the priests to the reign of darius the persian
the sons of levi the chief of the fathers were written in the book of the chronicles even until the days of johanan the son of eliashib
and the chief of the levites hashabiah sherebiah and jeshua the son of kadmiel with their brethren over against them to praise and to give thanks according to the commandment of david the man of god ward over against ward
mattaniah and bakbukiah obadiah meshullam talmon akkub were porters keeping the ward at the thresholds of the gates
these were in the days of joiakim the son of jeshua the son of jozadak and in the days of nehemiah the governor and of ezra the priest the scribe
and at the dedication of the wall of jerusalem they sought the levites out of all their places to bring them to jerusalem to keep the dedication with gladness both with thanksgivings and with singing with cymbals psalteries and with harps
and the sons of the singers gathered themselves together both out of the plain country round about jerusalem and from the villages of netophathi
also from the house of gilgal and out of the fields of geba and azmaveth for the singers had builded them villages round about jerusalem
and the priests and the levites purified themselves and purified the people and the gates and the wall
then i brought up the princes of judah upon the wall and appointed two great companies of them that gave thanks whereof one went on the right hand upon the wall toward the dung gate
and after them went hoshaiah and half of the princes of judah
and azariah ezra and meshullam
judah and benjamin and shemaiah and jeremiah
and certain of the priests sons with trumpets namely zechariah the son of jonathan the son of shemaiah the son of mattaniah the son of michaiah the son of zaccur the son of asaph
and his brethren shemaiah and azarael milalai gilalai maai nethaneel and judah hanani with the musical instruments of david the man of god and ezra the scribe before them
and at the fountain gate which was over against them they went up by the stairs of the city of david at the going up of the wall above the house of david even unto the water gate eastward
and the other company of them that gave thanks went over against them and i after them and the half of the people upon the wall from beyond the tower of the furnaces even unto the broad wall
and from above the gate of ephraim and above the old gate and above the fish gate and the tower of hananeel and the tower of meah even unto the sheep gate and they stood still in the prison gate
so stood the two companies of them that gave thanks in the house of god and i and the half of the rulers with me
and the priests eliakim maaseiah miniamin michaiah elioenai zechariah and hananiah with trumpets
and maaseiah and shemaiah and eleazar and uzzi and jehohanan and malchijah and elam and ezer and the singers sang loud with jezrahiah their overseer
also that day they offered great sacrifices and rejoiced for god had made them rejoice with great joy the wives also and the children rejoiced so that the joy of jerusalem was heard even afar off
and at that time were some appointed over the chambers for the treasures for the offerings for the firstfruits and for the tithes to gather into them out of the fields of the cities the portions of the law for the priests and levites for judah rejoiced for the priests and for the levites that waited
and both the singers and the porters kept the ward of their god and the ward of the purification according to the commandment of david and of solomon his son
for in the days of david and asaph of old there were chief of the singers and songs of praise and thanksgiving unto god
and all israel in the days of zerubbabel and in the days of nehemiah gave the portions of the singers and the porters every day his portion and they sanctified holy things unto the levites and the levites sanctified them unto the children of aaron
on that day they read in the book of moses in the audience of the people and therein was found written that the ammonite and the moabite should not come into the congregation of god for ever
because they met not the children of israel with bread and with water but hired balaam against them that he should curse them howbeit our god turned the curse into a blessing
now it came to pass when they had heard the law that they separated from israel all the mixed multitude
and before this eliashib the priest having the oversight of the chamber of the house of our god was allied unto tobiah
and he had prepared for him a great chamber where aforetime they laid the meat offerings the frankincense and the vessels and the tithes of the corn the new wine and the oil which was commanded to be given to the levites and the singers and the porters and the offerings of the priests
but in all this time was not i at jerusalem for in the two and thirtieth year of artaxerxes king of babylon came i unto the king and after certain days obtained i leave of the king
and i came to jerusalem and understood of the evil that eliashib did for tobiah in preparing him a chamber in the courts of the house of god
and it grieved me sore therefore i cast forth all the household stuff of tobiah out of the chamber
then i commanded and they cleansed the chambers and thither brought i again the vessels of the house of god with the meat offering and the frankincense
and i perceived that the portions of the levites had not been given them for the levites and the singers that did the work were fled every one to his field
then contended i with the rulers and said why is the house of god forsaken and i gathered them together and set them in their place
then brought all judah the tithe of the corn and the new wine and the oil unto the treasuries
and i made treasurers over the treasuries shelemiah the priest and zadok the scribe and of the levites pedaiah and next to them was hanan the son of zaccur the son of mattaniah for they were counted faithful and their office was to distribute unto their brethren
remember me o my god concerning this and wipe not out my good deeds that i have done for the house of my god and for the offices thereof
in those days saw i in judah some treading wine presses on the sabbath and bringing in sheaves and lading asses as also wine grapes and figs and all manner of burdens which they brought into jerusalem on the sabbath day and i testified against them in the day wherein they sold victuals
there dwelt men of tyre also therein which brought fish and all manner of ware and sold on the sabbath unto the children of judah and in jerusalem
then i contended with the nobles of judah and said unto them what evil thing is this that ye do and profane the sabbath day
did not your fathers thus and did not our god bring all this evil upon us and upon this city yet ye bring more wrath upon israel by profaning the sabbath
and it came to pass that when the gates of jerusalem began to be dark before the sabbath i commanded that the gates should be shut and charged that they should not be opened till after the sabbath and some of my servants set i at the gates that there should no burden be brought in on the sabbath day
so the merchants and sellers of all kind of ware lodged without jerusalem once or twice
then i testified against them and said unto them why lodge ye about the wall if ye do so again i will lay hands on you from that time forth came they no more on the sabbath
and i commanded the levites that they should cleanse themselves and that they should come and keep the gates to sanctify the sabbath day remember me o my god concerning this also and spare me according to the greatness of thy mercy
in those days also saw i jews that had married wives of ashdod of ammon and of moab
and their children spake half in the speech of ashdod and could not speak in the jews language but according to the language of each people
and i contended with them and cursed them and smote certain of them and plucked off their hair and made them swear by god saying ye shall not give your daughters unto their sons nor take their daughters unto your sons or for yourselves
did not solomon king of israel sin by these things yet among many nations was there no king like him who was beloved of his god and god made him king over all israel nevertheless even him did outlandish women cause to sin
shall we then hearken unto you to do all this great evil to transgress against our god in marrying strange wives
and one of the sons of joiada the son of eliashib the high priest was son in law to sanballat the horonite therefore i chased him from me
remember them o my god because they have defiled the priesthood and the covenant of the priesthood and of the levites
thus cleansed i them from all strangers and appointed the wards of the priests and the levites every one in his business
and for the wood offering at times appointed and for the firstfruits remember me o my god for good
now it came to pass in the days of ahasuerus this is ahasuerus which reigned from india even unto ethiopia over an hundred and seven and twenty provinces
that in those days when the king ahasuerus sat on the throne of his kingdom which was in shushan the palace
in the third year of his reign he made a feast unto all his princes and his servants the power of persia and media the nobles and princes of the provinces being before him
when he shewed the riches of his glorious kingdom and the honour of his excellent majesty many days even an hundred and fourscore days
and when these days were expired the king made a feast unto all the people that were present in shushan the palace both unto great and small seven days in the court of the garden of the king's palace
where were white green and blue hangings fastened with cords of fine linen and purple to silver rings and pillars of marble the beds were of gold and silver upon a pavement of red and blue and white and black marble
and they gave them drink in vessels of gold the vessels being diverse one from another and royal wine in abundance according to the state of the king
and the drinking was according to the law none did compel for so the king had appointed to all the officers of his house that they should do according to every man's pleasure
also vashti the queen made a feast for the women in the royal house which belonged to king ahasuerus
on the seventh day when the heart of the king was merry with wine he commanded mehuman biztha harbona bigtha and abagtha zethar and carcas the seven chamberlains that served in the presence of ahasuerus the king
to bring vashti the queen before the king with the crown royal to shew the people and the princes her beauty for she was fair to look on
but the queen vashti refused to come at the king's commandment by his chamberlains therefore was the king very wroth and his anger burned in him
then the king said to the wise men which knew the times for so was the king's manner toward all that knew law and judgment
and the next unto him was carshena shethar admatha tarshish meres marsena and memucan the seven princes of persia and media which saw the king's face and which sat the first in the kingdom
what shall we do unto the queen vashti according to law because she hath not performed the commandment of the king ahasuerus by the chamberlains
and memucan answered before the king and the princes vashti the queen hath not done wrong to the king only but also to all the princes and to all the people that are in all the provinces of the king ahasuerus
for this deed of the queen shall come abroad unto all women so that they shall despise their husbands in their eyes when it shall be reported the king ahasuerus commanded vashti the queen to be brought in before him but she came not
likewise shall the ladies of persia and media say this day unto all the king's princes which have heard of the deed of the queen thus shall there arise too much contempt and wrath
if it please the king let there go a royal commandment from him and let it be written among the laws of the persians and the medes that it be not altered that vashti come no more before king ahasuerus and let the king give her royal estate unto another that is better than she
and when the king's decree which he shall make shall be published throughout all his empire for it is great all the wives shall give to their husbands honour both to great and small
and the saying pleased the king and the princes and the king did according to the word of memucan
for he sent letters into all the king's provinces into every province according to the writing thereof and to every people after their language that every man should bear rule in his own house and that it should be published according to the language of every people
after these things when the wrath of king ahasuerus was appeased he remembered vashti and what she had done and what was decreed against her
then said the king's servants that ministered unto him let there be fair young virgins sought for the king
and let the king appoint officers in all the provinces of his kingdom that they may gather together all the fair young virgins unto shushan the palace to the house of the women unto the custody of hege the king's chamberlain keeper of the women and let their things for purification be given them
and let the maiden which pleaseth the king be queen instead of vashti and the thing pleased the king and he did so
now in shushan the palace there was a certain jew whose name was mordecai the son of jair the son of shimei the son of kish a benjamite
who had been carried away from jerusalem with the captivity which had been carried away with jeconiah king of judah whom nebuchadnezzar the king of babylon had carried away
and he brought up hadassah that is esther his uncle's daughter for she had neither father nor mother and the maid was fair and beautiful whom mordecai when her father and mother were dead took for his own daughter
so it came to pass when the king's commandment and his decree was heard and when many maidens were gathered together unto shushan the palace to the custody of hegai that esther was brought also unto the king's house to the custody of hegai keeper of the women
and the maiden pleased him and she obtained kindness of him and he speedily gave her her things for purification with such things as belonged to her and seven maidens which were meet to be given her out of the king's house and he preferred her and her maids unto the best place of the house of the women
esther had not shewed her people nor her kindred for mordecai had charged her that she should not shew it
and mordecai walked every day before the court of the women's house to know how esther did and what should become of her
now when every maid's turn was come to go in to king ahasuerus after that she had been twelve months according to the manner of the women for so were the days of their purifications accomplished to wit six months with oil of myrrh and six months with sweet odours and with other things for the purifying of the women
then thus came every maiden unto the king whatsoever she desired was given her to go with her out of the house of the women unto the king's house
in the evening she went and on the morrow she returned into the second house of the women to the custody of shaashgaz the king's chamberlain which kept the concubines she came in unto the king no more except the king delighted in her and that she were called by name
now when the turn of esther the daughter of abihail the uncle of mordecai who had taken her for his daughter was come to go in unto the king she required nothing but what hegai the king's chamberlain the keeper of the women appointed and esther obtained favour in the sight of all them that looked upon her
so esther was taken unto king ahasuerus into his house royal in the tenth month which is the month tebeth in the seventh year of his reign
and the king loved esther above all the women and she obtained grace and favour in his sight more than all the virgins so that he set the royal crown upon her head and made her queen instead of vashti
then the king made a great feast unto all his princes and his servants even esther's feast and he made a release to the provinces and gave gifts according to the state of the king
and when the virgins were gathered together the second time then mordecai sat in the king's gate
esther had not yet shewed her kindred nor her people as mordecai had charged her for esther did the commandment of mordecai like as when she was brought up with him
in those days while mordecai sat in the king's gate two of the king's chamberlains bigthan and teresh of those which kept the door were wroth and sought to lay hand on the king ahasuerus
and the thing was known to mordecai who told it unto esther the queen and esther certified the king thereof in mordecai's name
and when inquisition was made of the matter it was found out therefore they were both hanged on a tree and it was written in the book of the chronicles before the king
after these things did king ahasuerus promote haman the son of hammedatha the agagite and advanced him and set his seat above all the princes that were with him
and all the king's servants that were in the king's gate bowed and reverenced haman for the king had so commanded concerning him but mordecai bowed not nor did him reverence
then the king's servants which were in the king's gate said unto mordecai why transgressest thou the king's commandment
now it came to pass when they spake daily unto him and he hearkened not unto them that they told haman to see whether mordecai's matters would stand for he had told them that he was a jew
and when haman saw that mordecai bowed not nor did him reverence then was haman full of wrath
and he thought scorn to lay hands on mordecai alone for they had shewed him the people of mordecai wherefore haman sought to destroy all the jews that were throughout the whole kingdom of ahasuerus even the people of mordecai
in the first month that is the month nisan in the twelfth year of king ahasuerus they cast pur that is the lot before haman from day to day and from month to month to the twelfth month that is the month adar
and haman said unto king ahasuerus there is a certain people scattered abroad and dispersed among the people in all the provinces of thy kingdom and their laws are diverse from all people neither keep they the king's laws therefore it is not for the king's profit to suffer them
if it please the king let it be written that they may be destroyed and i will pay ten thousand talents of silver to the hands of those that have the charge of the business to bring it into the king's treasuries
and the king took his ring from his hand and gave it unto haman the son of hammedatha the agagite the jews enemy
and the king said unto haman the silver is given to thee the people also to do with them as it seemeth good to thee
then were the king's scribes called on the thirteenth day of the first month and there was written according to all that haman had commanded unto the king's lieutenants and to the governors that were over every province and to the rulers of every people of every province according to the writing thereof and to every people after their language in the name of king ahasuerus was it written and sealed with the king's ring
and the letters were sent by posts into all the king's provinces to destroy to kill and to cause to perish all jews both young and old little children and women in one day even upon the thirteenth day of the twelfth month which is the month adar and to take the spoil of them for a prey
the copy of the writing for a commandment to be given in every province was published unto all people that they should be ready against that day
the posts went out being hastened by the king's commandment and the decree was given in shushan the palace and the king and haman sat down to drink but the city shushan was perplexed
when mordecai perceived all that was done mordecai rent his clothes and put on sackcloth with ashes and went out into the midst of the city and cried with a loud and a bitter cry
and came even before the king's gate for none might enter into the king's gate clothed with sackcloth
and in every province whithersoever the king's commandment and his decree came there was great mourning among the jews and fasting and weeping and wailing and many lay in sackcloth and ashes
so esther's maids and her chamberlains came and told it her then was the queen exceedingly grieved and she sent raiment to clothe mordecai and to take away his sackcloth from him but he received it not
then called esther for hatach one of the king's chamberlains whom he had appointed to attend upon her and gave him a commandment to mordecai to know what it was and why it was
so hatach went forth to mordecai unto the street of the city which was before the king's gate
and mordecai told him of all that had happened unto him and of the sum of the money that haman had promised to pay to the king's treasuries for the jews to destroy them
also he gave him the copy of the writing of the decree that was given at shushan to destroy them to shew it unto esther and to declare it unto her and to charge her that she should go in unto the king to make supplication unto him and to make request before him for her people
and hatach came and told esther the words of mordecai
again esther spake unto hatach and gave him commandment unto mordecai
all the king's servants and the people of the king's provinces do know that whosoever whether man or woman shall come unto the king into the inner court who is not called there is one law of his to put him to death except such to whom the king shall hold out the golden sceptre that he may live but i have not been called to come in unto the king these thirty days
and they told to mordecai esther's words
then mordecai commanded to answer esther think not with thyself that thou shalt escape in the king's house more than all the jews
for if thou altogether holdest thy peace at this time then shall there enlargement and deliverance arise to the jews from another place but thou and thy father's house shall be destroyed and who knoweth whether thou art come to the kingdom for such a time as this
then esther bade them return mordecai this answer
go gather together all the jews that are present in shushan and fast ye for me and neither eat nor drink three days night or day i also and my maidens will fast likewise and so will i go in unto the king which is not according to the law and if i perish i perish
so mordecai went his way and did according to all that esther had commanded him
now it came to pass on the third day that esther put on her royal apparel and stood in the inner court of the king's house over against the king's house and the king sat upon his royal throne in the royal house over against the gate of the house
and it was so when the king saw esther the queen standing in the court that she obtained favour in his sight and the king held out to esther the golden sceptre that was in his hand so esther drew near and touched the top of the sceptre
then said the king unto her what wilt thou queen esther and what is thy request it shall be even given thee to the half of the kingdom
and esther answered if it seem good unto the king let the king and haman come this day unto the banquet that i have prepared for him
then the king said cause haman to make haste that he may do as esther hath said so the king and haman came to the banquet that esther had prepared
and the king said unto esther at the banquet of wine what is thy petition and it shall be granted thee and what is thy request even to the half of the kingdom it shall be performed
then answered esther and said my petition and my request is
if i have found favour in the sight of the king and if it please the king to grant my petition and to perform my request let the king and haman come to the banquet that i shall prepare for them and i will do to morrow as the king hath said
then went haman forth that day joyful and with a glad heart but when haman saw mordecai in the king's gate that he stood not up nor moved for him he was full of indignation against mordecai
nevertheless haman refrained himself and when he came home he sent and called for his friends and zeresh his wife
and haman told them of the glory of his riches and the multitude of his children and all the things wherein the king had promoted him and how he had advanced him above the princes and servants of the king
haman said moreover yea esther the queen did let no man come in with the king unto the banquet that she had prepared but myself and to morrow am i invited unto her also with the king
yet all this availeth me nothing so long as i see mordecai the jew sitting at the king's gate
then said zeresh his wife and all his friends unto him let a gallows be made of fifty cubits high and to morrow speak thou unto the king that mordecai may be hanged thereon then go thou in merrily with the king unto the banquet and the thing pleased haman and he caused the gallows to be made
on that night could not the king sleep and he commanded to bring the book of records of the chronicles and they were read before the king
and it was found written that mordecai had told of bigthana and teresh two of the king's chamberlains the keepers of the door who sought to lay hand on the king ahasuerus
and the king said what honour and dignity hath been done to mordecai for this then said the king's servants that ministered unto him there is nothing done for him
and the king said who is in the court now haman was come into the outward court of the king's house to speak unto the king to hang mordecai on the gallows that he had prepared for him
