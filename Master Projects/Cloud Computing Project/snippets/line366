act ii
scene ii rousillon the count's palace
 enter countess and clown
countess come on sir i shall now put you to the height of
 your breeding
clown i will show myself highly fed and lowly taught i
 know my business is but to the court
countess to the court why what place make you special
 when you put off that with such contempt but to the court
clown truly madam if god have lent a man any manners he
 may easily put it off at court he that cannot make
 a leg put off's cap kiss his hand and say nothing
 has neither leg hands lip nor cap and indeed
 such a fellow to say precisely were not for the
 court but for me i have an answer will serve all
 men

 questions
clown it is like a barber's chair that fits all buttocks
 the pinbuttock the quatchbuttock the brawn
 buttock or any buttock
countess will your answer serve fit to all questions
clown as fit as ten groats is for the hand of an attorney
 as your french crown for your taffeta punk as tib's
 rush for tom's forefinger as a pancake for shrove
 tuesday a morris for mayday as the nail to his
 hole the cuckold to his horn as a scolding queen
 to a wrangling knave as the nun's lip to the
 friar's mouth nay as the pudding to his skin
countess have you i say an answer of such fitness for all
 questions
clown from below your duke to beneath your constable it
 will fit any question
countess it must be an answer of most monstrous size that
 must fit all demands
clown but a trifle neither in good faith if the learned
 should speak truth of it here it is and all that
 belongs to't ask me if i am a courtier it shall
 do you no harm to learn
countess to be young again if we could i will be a fool in
 question hoping to be the wiser by your answer i
 pray you sir are you a courtier
clown o lord sir there's a simple putting off more
 more a hundred of them
countess sir i am a poor friend of yours that loves you
clown o lord sir thick thick spare not me
countess i think sir you can eat none of this homely meat
clown o lord sir nay put me to't i warrant you
countess you were lately whipped sir as i think
clown o lord sir spare not me
countess do you cry o lord sir at your whipping and
 spare not me indeed your o lord sir is very
 sequent to your whipping you would answer very well
 to a whipping if you were but bound to't
clown i ne'er had worse luck in my life in my o lord
 sir i see things may serve long but not serve ever
countess i play the noble housewife with the time
 to entertain't so merrily with a fool
clown o lord sir why there't serves well again
countess an end sir to your business give helen this
 and urge her to a present answer back
 commend me to my kinsmen and my son
 this is not much
clown not much commendation to them
countess not much employment for you you understand me
clown most fruitfully i am there before my legs
countess haste you again
 exeunt severally
 all's well that ends well
act ii
scene iii paris the king's palace
 enter bertram lafeu and parolles
lafeu they say miracles are past and we have our
 philosophical persons to make modern and familiar
 things supernatural and causeless hence is it that
 we make trifles of terrors ensconcing ourselves
 into seeming knowledge when we should submit
 ourselves to an unknown fear
parolles why tis the rarest argument of wonder that hath
 shot out in our latter times
bertram and so tis
lafeu to be relinquish'd of the artists
parolles so i say
lafeu both of galen and paracelsus
parolles so i say
lafeu of all the learned and authentic fellows
parolles right so i say
lafeu that gave him out incurable
parolles why there tis so say i too
lafeu not to be helped
parolles right as twere a man assured of a
lafeu uncertain life and sure death
parolles just you say well so would i have said
lafeu i may truly say it is a novelty to the world
parolles it is indeed if you will have it in showing you
 shall read it inwhat do you call there
lafeu a showing of a heavenly effect in an earthly actor
parolles that's it i would have said the very same
lafeu why your dolphin is not lustier fore me
 i speak in respect
parolles nay tis strange tis very strange that is the
 brief and the tedious of it and he's of a most
 facinerious spirit that will not acknowledge it to be the
lafeu very hand of heaven
parolles ay so i say
lafeu in a most weak
 pausing
 and debile minister great power great
 transcendence which should indeed give us a
 further use to be made than alone the recovery of
 the king as to be
 pausing
 generally thankful
parolles i would have said it you say well here comes the king
 enter king helena and attendants lafeu and
 parolles retire
lafeu lustig as the dutchman says i'll like a maid the
 better whilst i have a tooth in my head why he's
 able to lead her a coranto
parolles mort du vinaigre is not this helen
lafeu fore god i think so
king go call before me all the lords in court
 sit my preserver by thy patient's side
 and with this healthful hand whose banish'd sense
 thou hast repeal'd a second time receive
 the confirmation of my promised gift
 which but attends thy naming
 enter three or four lords
 fair maid send forth thine eye this youthful parcel
 of noble bachelors stand at my bestowing
 o'er whom both sovereign power and father's voice
 i have to use thy frank election make
 thou hast power to choose and they none to forsake
helena to each of you one fair and virtuous mistress
 fall when love please marry to each but one
lafeu i'ld give bay curtal and his furniture
 my mouth no more were broken than these boys'
 and writ as little beard
king peruse them well
 not one of those but had a noble father
helena gentlemen
 heaven hath through me restored the king to health
all we understand it and thank heaven for you
helena i am a simple maid and therein wealthiest
 that i protest i simply am a maid
 please it your majesty i have done already
 the blushes in my cheeks thus whisper me
 we blush that thou shouldst choose but be refused
 let the white death sit on thy cheek for ever
 we'll ne'er come there again'
king make choice and see
 who shuns thy love shuns all his love in me
helena now dian from thy altar do i fly
 and to imperial love that god most high
 do my sighs stream sir will you hear my suit
first lord and grant it
helena thanks sir all the rest is mute
lafeu i had rather be in this choice than throw amesace
 for my life
helena the honour sir that flames in your fair eyes
 before i speak too threateningly replies
 love make your fortunes twenty times above
 her that so wishes and her humble love
second lord no better if you please
helena my wish receive
 which great love grant and so i take my leave
lafeu do all they deny her an they were sons of mine
 i'd have them whipped or i would send them to the
 turk to make eunuchs of
helena be not afraid that i your hand should take
 i'll never do you wrong for your own sake
 blessing upon your vows and in your bed
 find fairer fortune if you ever wed
lafeu these boys are boys of ice they'll none have her
 sure they are bastards to the english the french
 ne'er got em
helena you are too young too happy and too good
 to make yourself a son out of my blood
fourth lord fair one i think not so
lafeu there's one grape yet i am sure thy father drunk
 wine but if thou be'st not an ass i am a youth
 of fourteen i have known thee already
helena to bertram i dare not say i take you but i give
 me and my service ever whilst i live
 into your guiding power this is the man
king why then young bertram take her she's thy wife
bertram my wife my liege i shall beseech your highness
 in such a business give me leave to use
 the help of mine own eyes
king know'st thou not bertram
 what she has done for me
bertram yes my good lord
