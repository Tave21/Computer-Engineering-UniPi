 that i shall die is true but for thy love by the
 lord no yet i love thee too and while thou
 livest dear kate take a fellow of plain and
 uncoined constancy for he perforce must do thee
 right because he hath not the gift to woo in other
 places for these fellows of infinite tongue that
 can rhyme themselves into ladies favours they do
 always reason themselves out again what a
 speaker is but a prater a rhyme is but a ballad a
 good leg will fall a straight back will stoop a
 black beard will turn white a curled pate will grow
 bald a fair face will wither a full eye will wax
 hollow but a good heart kate is the sun and the
 moon or rather the sun and not the moon for it
 shines bright and never changes but keeps his
 course truly if thou would have such a one take
 me and take me take a soldier take a soldier
 take a king and what sayest thou then to my love

 your heart but good kate mock me mercifully the
 rather gentle princess because i love thee
 cruelly if ever thou beest mine kate as i have a
 saving faith within me tells me thou shalt i get
 thee with scambling and thou must therefore needs

 dare not swear thou lovest me yet my blood begins to
 flatter me that thou dost notwithstanding the poor
 and untempering effect of my visage now beshrew
 my father's ambition he was thinking of civil wars
 when he got me therefore was i created with a
 stubborn outside with an aspect of iron that when
 i come to woo ladies i fright them but in faith
 kate the elder i wax the better i shall appear
 my comfort is that old age that ill layer up of
 beauty can do no more spoil upon my face thou
 hast me if thou hast me at the worst and thou
 shalt wear me if thou wear me better and better
 and therefore tell me most fair katharine will you
 have me put off your maiden blushes avouch the
 thoughts of your heart with the looks of an empress

 ear withal but i will tell thee aloud england is

king henry v madam my interpreter what says she
alice dat it is not be de fashion pour les ladies of
 francei cannot tell vat is baiser en anglish
king henry v to kiss
alice your majesty entendre bettre que moi
king henry v it is not a fashion for the maids in france to kiss
 before they are married would she say
alice oui vraiment
king henry v o kate nice customs curtsy to great kings dear
 kate you and i cannot be confined within the weak
 list of a country's fashion we are the makers of
 manners kate and the liberty that follows our
 places stops the mouth of all findfaults as i will
 do yours for upholding the nice fashion of your
 country in denying me a kiss therefore patiently
 and yielding
 kissing her
 you have witchcraft in your lips kate there is
 more eloquence in a sugar touch of them than in the
 tongues of the french council and they should
 sooner persuade harry of england than a general
 petition of monarchs here comes your father
 reenter the french king and his queen burgundy
 and other lords
burgundy god save your majesty my royal cousin teach you
 our princess english
king henry v i would have her learn my fair cousin how
 perfectly i love her and that is good english
burgundy is she not apt
king henry v our tongue is rough coz and my condition is not
 smooth so that having neither the voice nor the
 heart of flattery about me i cannot so conjure up
 the spirit of love in her that he will appear in
 his true likeness
burgundy pardon the frankness of my mirth if i answer you
 for that if you would conjure in her you must
 make a circle if conjure up love in her in his true
 likeness he must appear naked and blind can you
 blame her then being a maid yet rosed over with the
 virgin crimson of modesty if she deny the
 appearance of a naked blind boy in her naked seeing
 self it were my lord a hard condition for a maid
 to consign to
king henry v yet they do wink and yield as love is blind and enforces
burgundy they are then excused my lord when they see not
 what they do
king henry v then good my lord teach your cousin to consent winking
burgundy i will wink on her to consent my lord if you will
 teach her to know my meaning for maids well
 summered and warm kept are like flies at
 bartholomewtide blind though they have their
 eyes and then they will endure handling which
 before would not abide looking on
king henry v this moral ties me over to time and a hot summer
 and so i shall catch the fly your cousin in the
 latter end and she must be blind too
burgundy as love is my lord before it loves
king henry v it is so and you may some of you thank love for
 my blindness who cannot see many a fair french city
 for one fair french maid that stands in my way
french king yes my lord you see them perspectively the cities
 turned into a maid for they are all girdled with
 maiden walls that war hath never entered
king henry v shall kate be my wife
french king so please you
king henry v i am content so the maiden cities you talk of may
 wait on her so the maid that stood in the way for
 my wish shall show me the way to my will
french king we have consented to all terms of reason
king henry v is't so my lords of england
westmoreland the king hath granted every article
 his daughter first and then in sequel all
 according to their firm proposed natures
exeter only he hath not yet subscribed this
 where your majesty demands that the king of france
 having any occasion to write for matter of grant
 shall name your highness in this form and with this
 addition in french notre trescher fils henri roi
 d'angleterre heritier de france and thus in
 latin praeclarissimus filius noster henricus rex
 angliae et haeres franciae
french king nor this i have not brother so denied
 but your request shall make me let it pass
king henry v i pray you then in love and dear alliance
 let that one article rank with the rest
 and thereupon give me your daughter
french king take her fair son and from her blood raise up
 issue to me that the contending kingdoms
 of france and england whose very shores look pale
 with envy of each other's happiness
