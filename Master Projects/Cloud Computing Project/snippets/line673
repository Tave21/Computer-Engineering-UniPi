 and bear the name and port of gentlemen
 cut both the villains throats for die you shall
 the lives of those which we have lost in fight
 be counterpoised with such a petty sum
first gentleman i'll give it sir and therefore spare my life
second gentleman and so will i and write home for it straight
whitmore i lost mine eye in laying the prize aboard
 and therefore to revenge it shalt thou die
 to suffolk
 and so should these if i might have my will
captain be not so rash take ransom let him live
suffolk look on my george i am a gentleman
 rate me at what thou wilt thou shalt be paid
whitmore and so am i my name is walter whitmore
 how now why start'st thou what doth
 death affright
suffolk thy name affrights me in whose sound is death
 a cunning man did calculate my birth
 and told me that by water i should die
 yet let not this make thee be bloodyminded
 thy name is gaultier being rightly sounded
whitmore gaultier or walter which it is i care not
 never yet did base dishonour blur our name
 but with our sword we wiped away the blot
 therefore when merchantlike i sell revenge
 broke be my sword my arms torn and defaced
 and i proclaim'd a coward through the world
suffolk stay whitmore for thy prisoner is a prince
 the duke of suffolk william de la pole
whitmore the duke of suffolk muffled up in rags
suffolk ay but these rags are no part of the duke
 jove sometimes went disguised and why not i
captain but jove was never slain as thou shalt be
suffolk obscure and lowly swain king henry's blood
 the honourable blood of lancaster
 must not be shed by such a jaded groom
 hast thou not kiss'd thy hand and held my stirrup
 bareheaded plodded by my footcloth mule
 and thought thee happy when i shook my head
 how often hast thou waited at my cup
 fed from my trencher kneel'd down at the board
 when i have feasted with queen margaret
 remember it and let it make thee crestfall'n
 ay and allay this thy abortive pride
 how in our voiding lobby hast thou stood
 and duly waited for my coming forth
 this hand of mine hath writ in thy behalf
 and therefore shall it charm thy riotous tongue
whitmore speak captain shall i stab the forlorn swain
captain first let my words stab him as he hath me
suffolk base slave thy words are blunt and so art thou
captain convey him hence and on our longboat's side
 strike off his head
suffolk thou darest not for thy own
captain yes pole
suffolk pole
captain pool sir pool lord
 ay kennel puddle sink whose filth and dirt
 troubles the silver spring where england drinks
 now will i dam up this thy yawning mouth
 for swallowing the treasure of the realm
 thy lips that kiss'd the queen shall sweep the ground
 and thou that smiledst at good duke humphrey's death
 against the senseless winds shalt grin in vain
 who in contempt shall hiss at thee again
 and wedded be thou to the hags of hell
 for daring to affy a mighty lord
 unto the daughter of a worthless king
 having neither subject wealth nor diadem
 by devilish policy art thou grown great
 and like ambitious sylla overgorged
 with gobbets of thy mother's bleeding heart
 by thee anjou and maine were sold to france
 the false revolting normans thorough thee
 disdain to call us lord and picardy
 hath slain their governors surprised our forts
 and sent the ragged soldiers wounded home
 the princely warwick and the nevils all
 whose dreadful swords were never drawn in vain
 as hating thee are rising up in arms
 and now the house of york thrust from the crown
 by shameful murder of a guiltless king
 and lofty proud encroaching tyranny
 burns with revenging fire whose hopeful colours
 advance our halffaced sun striving to shine
 under the which is writ invitis nubibus'
 the commons here in kent are up in arms
 and to conclude reproach and beggary
 is crept into the palace of our king
 and all by thee away convey him hence
suffolk o that i were a god to shoot forth thunder
 upon these paltry servile abject drudges
 small things make base men proud this villain here
 being captain of a pinnace threatens more
 than bargulus the strong illyrian pirate
 drones suck not eagles blood but rob beehives
 it is impossible that i should die
 by such a lowly vassal as thyself
 thy words move rage and not remorse in me
 i go of message from the queen to france
 i charge thee waft me safely cross the channel
captain walter
whitmore come suffolk i must waft thee to thy death
suffolk gelidus timor occupat artus it is thee i fear
whitmore thou shalt have cause to fear before i leave thee
 what are ye daunted now now will ye stoop
first gentleman my gracious lord entreat him speak him fair
suffolk suffolk's imperial tongue is stern and rough
 used to command untaught to plead for favour
 far be it we should honour such as these
 with humble suit no rather let my head
 stoop to the block than these knees bow to any
 save to the god of heaven and to my king
 and sooner dance upon a bloody pole
 than stand uncover'd to the vulgar groom
 true nobility is exempt from fear
 more can i bear than you dare execute
captain hale him away and let him talk no more
suffolk come soldiers show what cruelty ye can
 that this my death may never be forgot
 great men oft die by vile bezonians
 a roman sworder and banditto slave
 murder'd sweet tully brutus bastard hand
 stabb'd julius caesar savage islanders
 pompey the great and suffolk dies by pirates
 exeunt whitmore and others with suffolk
captain and as for these whose ransom we have set
 it is our pleasure one of them depart
 therefore come you with us and let him go
 exeunt all but the first gentleman
 reenter whitmore with suffolk's body
whitmore there let his head and lifeless body lie
 until the queen his mistress bury it
 exit
first gentleman o barbarous and bloody spectacle
 his body will i bear unto the king
 if he revenge it not yet will his friends
 so will the queen that living held him dear
 exit with the body
 2 king henry vi

bevis o miserable age virtue is not regarded in handicraftsmen
holland the nobility think scorn to go in leather aprons
bevis nay more the king's council are no good workmen
holland true and yet it is said labour in thy vocation
 which is as much to say as let the magistrates be
 labouring men and therefore should we be
 magistrates

 brave mind than a hard hand
holland i see them i see them there's best's son the
 tanner of wingham

 dog'sleather of

holland come come let's fall in with them
 drum enter cade dick the butcher smith the
 weaver and a sawyer with infinite numbers

 the spirit of putting down kings and princes

 bricklayer

 father had never a house but the cage
cade valiant i am
smith aside a must needs for beggary is valiant
cade i am able to endure much
dick aside no question of that for i have seen him
 whipped three marketdays together
cade i fear neither sword nor fire
smith aside he need not fear the sword for his coat is of proof
dick aside but methinks he should stand in fear of
 fire being burnt i the hand for stealing of sheep
