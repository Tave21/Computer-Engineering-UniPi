and their words pleased hamor and shechem hamor's son
and the young man deferred not to do the thing because he had delight in jacob's daughter and he was more honourable than all the house of his father
and hamor and shechem his son came unto the gate of their city and communed with the men of their city saying
these men are peaceable with us therefore let them dwell in the land and trade therein for the land behold it is large enough for them let us take their daughters to us for wives and let us give them our daughters
only herein will the men consent unto us for to dwell with us to be one people if every male among us be circumcised as they are circumcised
shall not their cattle and their substance and every beast of theirs be ours only let us consent unto them and they will dwell with us
and unto hamor and unto shechem his son hearkened all that went out of the gate of his city and every male was circumcised all that went out of the gate of his city
and it came to pass on the third day when they were sore that two of the sons of jacob simeon and levi dinah's brethren took each man his sword and came upon the city boldly and slew all the males
and they slew hamor and shechem his son with the edge of the sword and took dinah out of shechem's house and went out
the sons of jacob came upon the slain and spoiled the city because they had defiled their sister
they took their sheep and their oxen and their asses and that which was in the city and that which was in the field
and all their wealth and all their little ones and their wives took they captive and spoiled even all that was in the house
and jacob said to simeon and levi ye have troubled me to make me to stink among the inhabitants of the land among the canaanites and the perizzites and i being few in number they shall gather themselves together against me and slay me and i shall be destroyed i and my house
and they said should he deal with our sister as with an harlot
and god said unto jacob arise go up to bethel and dwell there and make there an altar unto god that appeared unto thee when thou fleddest from the face of esau thy brother
then jacob said unto his household and to all that were with him put away the strange gods that are among you and be clean and change your garments
and let us arise and go up to bethel and i will make there an altar unto god who answered me in the day of my distress and was with me in the way which i went
and they gave unto jacob all the strange gods which were in their hand and all their earrings which were in their ears and jacob hid them under the oak which was by shechem
and they journeyed and the terror of god was upon the cities that were round about them and they did not pursue after the sons of jacob
so jacob came to luz which is in the land of canaan that is bethel he and all the people that were with him
and he built there an altar and called the place elbethel because there god appeared unto him when he fled from the face of his brother
but deborah rebekah's nurse died and she was buried beneath bethel under an oak and the name of it was called allonbachuth
and god appeared unto jacob again when he came out of padanaram and blessed him
and god said unto him thy name is jacob thy name shall not be called any more jacob but israel shall be thy name and he called his name israel
and god said unto him i am god almighty be fruitful and multiply a nation and a company of nations shall be of thee and kings shall come out of thy loins
and the land which i gave abraham and isaac to thee i will give it and to thy seed after thee will i give the land
and god went up from him in the place where he talked with him
and jacob set up a pillar in the place where he talked with him even a pillar of stone and he poured a drink offering thereon and he poured oil thereon
and jacob called the name of the place where god spake with him bethel
and they journeyed from bethel and there was but a little way to come to ephrath and rachel travailed and she had hard labour
and it came to pass when she was in hard labour that the midwife said unto her fear not thou shalt have this son also
and it came to pass as her soul was in departing for she died that she called his name benoni but his father called him benjamin
and rachel died and was buried in the way to ephrath which is bethlehem
and jacob set a pillar upon her grave that is the pillar of rachel's grave unto this day
and israel journeyed and spread his tent beyond the tower of edar
and it came to pass when israel dwelt in that land that reuben went and lay with bilhah his father's concubine and israel heard it now the sons of jacob were twelve

and the days of isaac were an hundred and fourscore years
and isaac gave up the ghost and died and was gathered unto his people being old and full of days and his sons esau and jacob buried him

and jacob dwelt in the land wherein his father was a stranger in the land of canaan
these are the generations of jacob joseph being seventeen years old was feeding the flock with his brethren and the lad was with the sons of bilhah and with the sons of zilpah his father's wives and joseph brought unto his father their evil report
now israel loved joseph more than all his children because he was the son of his old age and he made him a coat of many colours
and when his brethren saw that their father loved him more than all his brethren they hated him and could not speak peaceably unto him
and joseph dreamed a dream and he told it his brethren and they hated him yet the more
and he said unto them hear i pray you this dream which i have dreamed
for behold we were binding sheaves in the field and lo my sheaf arose and also stood upright and behold your sheaves stood round about and made obeisance to my sheaf
and his brethren said to him shalt thou indeed reign over us or shalt thou indeed have dominion over us and they hated him yet the more for his dreams and for his words
and he dreamed yet another dream and told it his brethren and said behold i have dreamed a dream more and behold the sun and the moon and the eleven stars made obeisance to me
and he told it to his father and to his brethren and his father rebuked him and said unto him what is this dream that thou hast dreamed shall i and thy mother and thy brethren indeed come to bow down ourselves to thee to the earth
and his brethren envied him but his father observed the saying
and his brethren went to feed their father's flock in shechem
and israel said unto joseph do not thy brethren feed the flock in shechem come and i will send thee unto them and he said to him here am i
and he said to him go i pray thee see whether it be well with thy brethren and well with the flocks and bring me word again so he sent him out of the vale of hebron and he came to shechem
and a certain man found him and behold he was wandering in the field and the man asked him saying what seekest thou
and he said i seek my brethren tell me i pray thee where they feed their flocks
and the man said they are departed hence for i heard them say let us go to dothan and joseph went after his brethren and found them in dothan
and when they saw him afar off even before he came near unto them they conspired against him to slay him
and they said one to another behold this dreamer cometh
come now therefore and let us slay him and cast him into some pit and we will say some evil beast hath devoured him and we shall see what will become of his dreams
and reuben heard it and he delivered him out of their hands and said let us not kill him
and reuben said unto them shed no blood but cast him into this pit that is in the wilderness and lay no hand upon him that he might rid him out of their hands to deliver him to his father again
and it came to pass when joseph was come unto his brethren that they stript joseph out of his coat his coat of many colours that was on him
and they took him and cast him into a pit and the pit was empty there was no water in it
and they sat down to eat bread and they lifted up their eyes and looked and behold a company of ishmeelites came from gilead with their camels bearing spicery and balm and myrrh going to carry it down to egypt
and judah said unto his brethren what profit is it if we slay our brother and conceal his blood
come and let us sell him to the ishmeelites and let not our hand be upon him for he is our brother and our flesh and his brethren were content
then there passed by midianites merchantmen and they drew and lifted up joseph out of the pit and sold joseph to the ishmeelites for twenty pieces of silver and they brought joseph into egypt
and reuben returned unto the pit and behold joseph was not in the pit and he rent his clothes
and he returned unto his brethren and said the child is not and i whither shall i go
and they took joseph's coat and killed a kid of the goats and dipped the coat in the blood
and they sent the coat of many colours and they brought it to their father and said this have we found know now whether it be thy son's coat or no
and he knew it and said it is my son's coat an evil beast hath devoured him joseph is without doubt rent in pieces
and jacob rent his clothes and put sackcloth upon his loins and mourned for his son many days
and all his sons and all his daughters rose up to comfort him but he refused to be comforted and he said for i will go down into the grave unto my son mourning thus his father wept for him
and the midianites sold him into egypt unto potiphar an officer of pharaoh's and captain of the guard
and it came to pass at that time that judah went down from his brethren and turned in to a certain adullamite whose name was hirah
and judah saw there a daughter of a certain canaanite whose name was shuah and he took her and went in unto her
and she conceived and bare a son and he called his name er
and she conceived again and bare a son and she called his name onan
and she yet again conceived and bare a son and called his name shelah and he was at chezib when she bare him
and judah took a wife for er his firstborn whose name was tamar
and er judah's firstborn was wicked in the sight of the lord and the lord slew him
and judah said unto onan go in unto thy brother's wife and marry her and raise up seed to thy brother
and onan knew that the seed should not be his and it came to pass when he went in unto his brother's wife that he spilled it on the ground lest that he should give seed to his brother
and the thing which he did displeased the lord wherefore he slew him also
then said judah to tamar his daughter in law remain a widow at thy father's house till shelah my son be grown for he said lest peradventure he die also as his brethren did and tamar went and dwelt in her father's house
and in process of time the daughter of shuah judah's wife died and judah was comforted and went up unto his sheepshearers to timnath he and his friend hirah the adullamite
and it was told tamar saying behold thy father in law goeth up to timnath to shear his sheep
and she put her widow's garments off from her and covered her with a vail and wrapped herself and sat in an open place which is by the way to timnath for she saw that shelah was grown and she was not given unto him to wife
when judah saw her he thought her to be an harlot because she had covered her face
and he turned unto her by the way and said go to i pray thee let me come in unto thee for he knew not that she was his daughter in law and she said what wilt thou give me that thou mayest come in unto me
and he said i will send thee a kid from the flock and she said wilt thou give me a pledge till thou send it
and he said what pledge shall i give thee and she said thy signet and thy bracelets and thy staff that is in thine hand and he gave it her and came in unto her and she conceived by him
and she arose and went away and laid by her vail from her and put on the garments of her widowhood
and judah sent the kid by the hand of his friend the adullamite to receive his pledge from the woman's hand but he found her not
then he asked the men of that place saying where is the harlot that was openly by the way side and they said there was no harlot in this place
and he returned to judah and said i cannot find her and also the men of the place said that there was no harlot in this place
and judah said let her take it to her lest we be shamed behold i sent this kid and thou hast not found her
and it came to pass about three months after that it was told judah saying tamar thy daughter in law hath played the harlot and also behold she is with child by whoredom and judah said bring her forth and let her be burnt
when she was brought forth she sent to her father in law saying by the man whose these are am i with child and she said discern i pray thee whose are these the signet and bracelets and staff
and judah acknowledged them and said she hath been more righteous than i because that i gave her not to shelah my son and he knew her again no more
and it came to pass in the time of her travail that behold twins were in her womb
and it came to pass when she travailed that the one put out his hand and the midwife took and bound upon his hand a scarlet thread saying this came out first
and it came to pass as he drew back his hand that behold his brother came out and she said how hast thou broken forth this breach be upon thee therefore his name was called pharez
and afterward came out his brother that had the scarlet thread upon his hand and his name was called zarah
and joseph was brought down to egypt and potiphar an officer of pharaoh captain of the guard an egyptian bought him of the hands of the ishmeelites which had brought him down thither
and the lord was with joseph and he was a prosperous man and he was in the house of his master the egyptian
and his master saw that the lord was with him and that the lord made all that he did to prosper in his hand
and joseph found grace in his sight and he served him and he made him overseer over his house and all that he had he put into his hand
and it came to pass from the time that he had made him overseer in his house and over all that he had that the lord blessed the egyptian's house for joseph's sake and the blessing of the lord was upon all that he had in the house and in the field
and he left all that he had in joseph's hand and he knew not ought he had save the bread which he did eat and joseph was a goodly person and well favoured
and it came to pass after these things that his master's wife cast her eyes upon joseph and she said lie with me
but he refused and said unto his master's wife behold my master wotteth not what is with me in the house and he hath committed all that he hath to my hand
there is none greater in this house than i neither hath he kept back any thing from me but thee because thou art his wife how then can i do this great wickedness and sin against god
and it came to pass as she spake to joseph day by day that he hearkened not unto her to lie by her or to be with her
and it came to pass about this time that joseph went into the house to do his business and there was none of the men of the house there within
and she caught him by his garment saying lie with me and he left his garment in her hand and fled and got him out
and it came to pass when she saw that he had left his garment in her hand and was fled forth
that she called unto the men of her house and spake unto them saying see he hath brought in an hebrew unto us to mock us he came in unto me to lie with me and i cried with a loud voice
and it came to pass when he heard that i lifted up my voice and cried that he left his garment with me and fled and got him out
and she laid up his garment by her until his lord came home
and she spake unto him according to these words saying the hebrew servant which thou hast brought unto us came in unto me to mock me
and it came to pass as i lifted up my voice and cried that he left his garment with me and fled out
and it came to pass when his master heard the words of his wife which she spake unto him saying after this manner did thy servant to me that his wrath was kindled
and joseph's master took him and put him into the prison a place where the king's prisoners were bound and he was there in the prison
but the lord was with joseph and shewed him mercy and gave him favour in the sight of the keeper of the prison
and the keeper of the prison committed to joseph's hand all the prisoners that were in the prison and whatsoever they did there he was the doer of it
the keeper of the prison looked not to any thing that was under his hand because the lord was with him and that which he did the lord made it to prosper
and it came to pass after these things that the butler of the king of egypt and his baker had offended their lord the king of egypt
and pharaoh was wroth against two of his officers against the chief of the butlers and against the chief of the bakers
and he put them in ward in the house of the captain of the guard into the prison the place where joseph was bound
and the captain of the guard charged joseph with them and he served them and they continued a season in ward
and they dreamed a dream both of them each man his dream in one night each man according to the interpretation of his dream the butler and the baker of the king of egypt which were bound in the prison
and joseph came in unto them in the morning and looked upon them and behold they were sad
and he asked pharaoh's officers that were with him in the ward of his lord's house saying wherefore look ye so sadly to day
and they said unto him we have dreamed a dream and there is no interpreter of it and joseph said unto them do not interpretations belong to god tell me them i pray you
and the chief butler told his dream to joseph and said to him in my dream behold a vine was before me
and in the vine were three branches and it was as though it budded and her blossoms shot forth and the clusters thereof brought forth ripe grapes
and pharaoh's cup was in my hand and i took the grapes and pressed them into pharaoh's cup and i gave the cup into pharaoh's hand
and joseph said unto him this is the interpretation of it the three branches are three days
yet within three days shall pharaoh lift up thine head and restore thee unto thy place and thou shalt deliver pharaoh's cup into his hand after the former manner when thou wast his butler
but think on me when it shall be well with thee and shew kindness i pray thee unto me and make mention of me unto pharaoh and bring me out of this house
for indeed i was stolen away out of the land of the hebrews and here also have i done nothing that they should put me into the dungeon
when the chief baker saw that the interpretation was good he said unto joseph i also was in my dream and behold i had three white baskets on my head
and in the uppermost basket there was of all manner of bakemeats for pharaoh and the birds did eat them out of the basket upon my head
and joseph answered and said this is the interpretation thereof the three baskets are three days
yet within three days shall pharaoh lift up thy head from off thee and shall hang thee on a tree and the birds shall eat thy flesh from off thee
and it came to pass the third day which was pharaoh's birthday that he made a feast unto all his servants and he lifted up the head of the chief butler and of the chief baker among his servants
and he restored the chief butler unto his butlership again and he gave the cup into pharaoh's hand
but he hanged the chief baker as joseph had interpreted to them
yet did not the chief butler remember joseph but forgat him
and it came to pass at the end of two full years that pharaoh dreamed and behold he stood by the river
and behold there came up out of the river seven well favoured kine and fatfleshed and they fed in a meadow
