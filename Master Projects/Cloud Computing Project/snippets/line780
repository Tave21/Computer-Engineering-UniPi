 under our tents i'll play the eavesdropper
 to see if any mean to shrink from me
 exeunt
 enter the lords to richmond sitting in his tent
lords good morrow richmond
richmond cry mercy lords and watchful gentlemen
 that you have ta'en a tardy sluggard here
lords how have you slept my lord
richmond the sweetest sleep and fairestboding dreams
 that ever enter'd in a drowsy head
 have i since your departure had my lords
 methought their souls whose bodies richard murder'd
 came to my tent and cried on victory
 i promise you my soul is very jocund
 in the remembrance of so fair a dream
 how far into the morning is it lords
lords upon the stroke of four
richmond why then tis time to arm and give direction
 his oration to his soldiers
 more than i have said loving countrymen
 the leisure and enforcement of the time
 forbids to dwell upon yet remember this
 god and our good cause fight upon our side
 the prayers of holy saints and wronged souls
 like highrear'd bulwarks stand before our faces
 richard except those whom we fight against
 had rather have us win than him they follow
 for what is he they follow truly gentlemen
 a bloody tyrant and a homicide
 one raised in blood and one in blood establish'd
 one that made means to come by what he hath
 and slaughter'd those that were the means to help him
 abase foul stone made precious by the foil
 of england's chair where he is falsely set
 one that hath ever been god's enemy
 then if you fight against god's enemy
 god will in justice ward you as his soldiers
 if you do sweat to put a tyrant down
 you sleep in peace the tyrant being slain
 if you do fight against your country's foes
 your country's fat shall pay your pains the hire
 if you do fight in safeguard of your wives
 your wives shall welcome home the conquerors
 if you do free your children from the sword
 your children's children quit it in your age
 then in the name of god and all these rights
 advance your standards draw your willing swords
 for me the ransom of my bold attempt
 shall be this cold corpse on the earth's cold face
 but if i thrive the gain of my attempt
 the least of you shall share his part thereof
 sound drums and trumpets boldly and cheerfully
 god and saint george richmond and victory

 reenter king richard ratcliff attendants
 and forces
king richard iii what said northumberland as touching richmond
ratcliff that he was never trained up in arms
king richard iii he said the truth and what said surrey then
ratcliff he smiled and said the better for our purpose'
king richard iii he was in the right and so indeed it is
 clock striketh
 ten the clock there give me a calendar
 who saw the sun today
ratcliff not i my lord
king richard iii then he disdains to shine for by the book
 he should have braved the east an hour ago
 a black day will it be to somebody ratcliff
ratcliff my lord
king richard iii the sun will not be seen today
 the sky doth frown and lour upon our army
 i would these dewy tears were from the ground
 not shine today why what is that to me
 more than to richmond for the selfsame heaven
 that frowns on me looks sadly upon him
 enter norfolk
norfolk arm arm my lord the foe vaunts in the field
king richard iii come bustle bustle caparison my horse
 call up lord stanley bid him bring his power
 i will lead forth my soldiers to the plain
 and thus my battle shall be ordered
 my foreward shall be drawn out all in length
 consisting equally of horse and foot
 our archers shall be placed in the midst
 john duke of norfolk thomas earl of surrey
 shall have the leading of this foot and horse
 they thus directed we will follow
 in the main battle whose puissance on either side
 shall be well winged with our chiefest horse
 this and saint george to boot what think'st thou norfolk
norfolk a good direction warlike sovereign
 this found i on my tent this morning
 he sheweth him a paper
king richard iii reads
 jockey of norfolk be not too bold
 for dickon thy master is bought and sold'
 a thing devised by the enemy
 go gentleman every man unto his charge
 let not our babbling dreams affright our souls
 conscience is but a word that cowards use
 devised at first to keep the strong in awe
 our strong arms be our conscience swords our law
 march on join bravely let us to't pellmell
 if not to heaven then hand in hand to hell
 his oration to his army
 what shall i say more than i have inferr'd
 remember whom you are to cope withal
 a sort of vagabonds rascals and runaways
 a scum of bretons and base lackey peasants
 whom their o'ercloyed country vomits forth
 to desperate ventures and assured destruction
 you sleeping safe they bring to you unrest
 you having lands and blest with beauteous wives
 they would restrain the one distain the other
 and who doth lead them but a paltry fellow
 long kept in bretagne at our mother's cost
 a milksop one that never in his life
 felt so much cold as over shoes in snow
 let's whip these stragglers o'er the seas again
 lash hence these overweening rags of france
 these famish'd beggars weary of their lives
 who but for dreaming on this fond exploit
 for want of means poor rats had hang'd themselves
 if we be conquer'd let men conquer us
 and not these bastard bretons whom our fathers
 have in their own land beaten bobb'd and thump'd
 and in record left them the heirs of shame
 shall these enjoy our lands lie with our wives
 ravish our daughters
 drum afar off
 hark i hear their drum
 fight gentlemen of england fight bold yoemen
 draw archers draw your arrows to the head
 spur your proud horses hard and ride in blood
 amaze the welkin with your broken staves
 enter a messenger
 what says lord stanley will he bring his power
messenger my lord he doth deny to come
king richard iii off with his son george's head
norfolk my lord the enemy is past the marsh
 after the battle let george stanley die
king richard iii a thousand hearts are great within my bosom
 advance our standards set upon our foes
 our ancient word of courage fair saint george
 inspire us with the spleen of fiery dragons
 upon them victory sits on our helms

 sir robert brakenbury and sir william brandon
richmond inter their bodies as becomes their births
 proclaim a pardon to the soldiers fled
 that in submission will return to us
 and then as we have ta'en the sacrament
 we will unite the white rose and the red
 smile heaven upon this fair conjunction
 that long have frown'd upon their enmity
 what traitor hears me and says not amen
 england hath long been mad and scarr'd herself
 the brother blindly shed the brother's blood
 the father rashly slaughter'd his own son
 the son compell'd been butcher to the sire
