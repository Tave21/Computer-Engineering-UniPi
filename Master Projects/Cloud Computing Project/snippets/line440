 more grave and wrinkled than the aims and ends
 of burning youth
friar thomas may your grace speak of it
duke vincentio my holy sir none better knows than you
 how i have ever loved the life removed
 and held in idle price to haunt assemblies
 where youth and cost and witless bravery keeps
 i have deliver'd to lord angelo
 a man of stricture and firm abstinence
 my absolute power and place here in vienna
 and he supposes me travell'd to poland
 for so i have strew'd it in the common ear
 and so it is received now pious sir
 you will demand of me why i do this
friar thomas gladly my lord
duke vincentio we have strict statutes and most biting laws
 the needful bits and curbs to headstrong weeds
 which for this nineteen years we have let slip
 even like an o'ergrown lion in a cave
 that goes not out to prey now as fond fathers
 having bound up the threatening twigs of birch
 only to stick it in their children's sight
 for terror not to use in time the rod
 becomes more mock'd than fear'd so our decrees
 dead to infliction to themselves are dead
 and liberty plucks justice by the nose
 the baby beats the nurse and quite athwart
 goes all decorum
friar thomas it rested in your grace
 to unloose this tiedup justice when you pleased
 and it in you more dreadful would have seem'd
 than in lord angelo
duke vincentio i do fear too dreadful
 sith twas my fault to give the people scope
 twould be my tyranny to strike and gall them
 for what i bid them do for we bid this be done
 when evil deeds have their permissive pass
 and not the punishment therefore indeed my father
 i have on angelo imposed the office
 who may in the ambush of my name strike home
 and yet my nature never in the fight
 to do in slander and to behold his sway
 i will as twere a brother of your order
 visit both prince and people therefore i prithee
 supply me with the habit and instruct me
 how i may formally in person bear me
 like a true friar more reasons for this action
 at our more leisure shall i render you
 only this one lord angelo is precise
 stands at a guard with envy scarce confesses
 that his blood flows or that his appetite
 is more to bread than stone hence shall we see
 if power change purpose what our seemers be

act i
scene iv a nunnery
 enter isabella and francisca
isabella and have you nuns no farther privileges
francisca are not these large enough
isabella yes truly i speak not as desiring more
 but rather wishing a more strict restraint
 upon the sisterhood the votarists of saint clare
lucio within ho peace be in this place
isabella who's that which calls
francisca it is a man's voice gentle isabella
 turn you the key and know his business of him
 you may i may not you are yet unsworn
 when you have vow'd you must not speak with men
 but in the presence of the prioress
 then if you speak you must not show your face
 or if you show your face you must not speak
 he calls again i pray you answer him
 exit
isabella peace and prosperity who is't that calls
 enter lucio
lucio hail virgin if you be as those cheekroses
 proclaim you are no less can you so stead me
 as bring me to the sight of isabella
 a novice of this place and the fair sister
 to her unhappy brother claudio
isabella why her unhappy brother let me ask
 the rather for i now must make you know
 i am that isabella and his sister
lucio gentle and fair your brother kindly greets you
 not to be weary with you he's in prison
isabella woe me for what
lucio for that which if myself might be his judge
 he should receive his punishment in thanks
 he hath got his friend with child
isabella sir make me not your story
lucio it is true
 i would notthough tis my familiar sin
 with maids to seem the lapwing and to jest
 tongue far from heartplay with all virgins so
 i hold you as a thing ensky'd and sainted
 by your renouncement an immortal spirit
 and to be talk'd with in sincerity
 as with a saint
isabella you do blaspheme the good in mocking me
lucio do not believe it fewness and truth tis thus
 your brother and his lover have embraced
 as those that feed grow full as blossoming time
 that from the seedness the bare fallow brings
 to teeming foison even so her plenteous womb
 expresseth his full tilth and husbandry
isabella some one with child by him my cousin juliet
lucio is she your cousin
isabella adoptedly as schoolmaids change their names
 by vain though apt affection
lucio she it is
isabella o let him marry her
lucio this is the point
 the duke is very strangely gone from hence
 bore many gentlemen myself being one
 in hand and hope of action but we do learn
 by those that know the very nerves of state
 his givingsout were of an infinite distance
 from his truemeant design upon his place
 and with full line of his authority
 governs lord angelo a man whose blood
 is very snowbroth one who never feels
 the wanton stings and motions of the sense
 but doth rebate and blunt his natural edge
 with profits of the mind study and fast
 heto give fear to use and liberty
 which have for long run by the hideous law
 as mice by lionshath pick'd out an act
 under whose heavy sense your brother's life
 falls into forfeit he arrests him on it
 and follows close the rigour of the statute
 to make him an example all hope is gone
 unless you have the grace by your fair prayer
 to soften angelo and that's my pith of business
 twixt you and your poor brother
isabella doth he so seek his life
lucio has censured him
 already and as i hear the provost hath
 a warrant for his execution
isabella alas what poor ability's in me
 to do him good
lucio assay the power you have
isabella my power alas i doubt
lucio our doubts are traitors
 and make us lose the good we oft might win
 by fearing to attempt go to lord angelo
 and let him learn to know when maidens sue
 men give like gods but when they weep and kneel
 all their petitions are as freely theirs
 as they themselves would owe them
isabella i'll see what i can do
lucio but speedily
isabella i will about it straight
 no longer staying but to give the mother
 notice of my affair i humbly thank you
 commend me to my brother soon at night
 i'll send him certain word of my success
lucio i take my leave of you
isabella good sir adieu

act ii
scene i a hall in angelo's house
 enter angelo escalus and a justice provost
 officers and other attendants behind
angelo we must not make a scarecrow of the law
 setting it up to fear the birds of prey
 and let it keep one shape till custom make it
 their perch and not their terror
escalus ay but yet
 let us be keen and rather cut a little
 than fall and bruise to death alas this gentleman
 whom i would save had a most noble father
 let but your honour know
 whom i believe to be most strait in virtue
 that in the working of your own affections
 had time cohered with place or place with wishing
 or that the resolute acting of your blood
 could have attain'd the effect of your own purpose
 whether you had not sometime in your life
 err'd in this point which now you censure him
 and pull'd the law upon you
angelo tis one thing to be tempted escalus
 another thing to fall i not deny
 the jury passing on the prisoner's life
 may in the sworn twelve have a thief or two
 guiltier than him they try what's open made to justice
 that justice seizes what know the laws
 that thieves do pass on thieves tis very pregnant
 the jewel that we find we stoop and take't
 because we see it but what we do not see
 we tread upon and never think of it
 you may not so extenuate his offence
 for i have had such faults but rather tell me
 when i that censure him do so offend
 let mine own judgment pattern out my death
 and nothing come in partial sir he must die
escalus be it as your wisdom will
angelo where is the provost
provost here if it like your honour
