cardinal wolsey i do profess
 that for your highness good i ever labour'd
 more than mine own that am have and will be
 though all the world should crack their duty to you
 and throw it from their soul though perils did
 abound as thick as thought could make em and
 appear in forms more horridyet my duty
 as doth a rock against the chiding flood
 should the approach of this wild river break
 and stand unshaken yours
king henry viii tis nobly spoken
 take notice lords he has a loyal breast
 for you have seen him open't read o'er this
 giving him papers
 and after this and then to breakfast with
 what appetite you have
 exit king henry viii frowning upon cardinal wolsey
 the nobles throng after him smiling and whispering
cardinal wolsey what should this mean
 what sudden anger's this how have i reap'd it
 he parted frowning from me as if ruin
 leap'd from his eyes so looks the chafed lion
 upon the daring huntsman that has gall'd him
 then makes him nothing i must read this paper
 i fear the story of his anger tis so
 this paper has undone me tis the account
 of all that world of wealth i have drawn together
 for mine own ends indeed to gain the popedom
 and fee my friends in rome o negligence
 fit for a fool to fall by what cross devil
 made me put this main secret in the packet
 i sent the king is there no way to cure this
 no new device to beat this from his brains
 i know twill stir him strongly yet i know
 a way if it take right in spite of fortune
 will bring me off again what's this to the pope'
 the letter as i live with all the business
 i writ to's holiness nay then farewell
 i have touch'd the highest point of all my greatness
 and from that full meridian of my glory
 i haste now to my setting i shall fall
 like a bright exhalation m the evening
 and no man see me more
 reenter to cardinal wolsey norfolk and suffolk surrey
 and the chamberlain
norfolk hear the king's pleasure cardinal who commands you
 to render up the great seal presently
 into our hands and to confine yourself
 to asher house my lord of winchester's
 till you hear further from his highness
cardinal wolsey stay
 where's your commission lords words cannot carry
 authority so weighty
suffolk who dare cross em
 bearing the king's will from his mouth expressly
cardinal wolsey till i find more than will or words to do it
 i mean your malice know officious lords
 i dare and must deny it now i feel
 of what coarse metal ye are moulded envy
 how eagerly ye follow my disgraces
 as if it fed ye and how sleek and wanton
 ye appear in every thing may bring my ruin
 follow your envious courses men of malice
 you have christian warrant for em and no doubt
 in time will find their fit rewards that seal
 you ask with such a violence the king
 mine and your master with his own hand gave me
 bade me enjoy it with the place and honours
 during my life and to confirm his goodness
 tied it by letterspatents now who'll take it
surrey the king that gave it
cardinal wolsey it must be himself then
surrey thou art a proud traitor priest
cardinal wolsey proud lord thou liest
 within these forty hours surrey durst better
 have burnt that tongue than said so
surrey thy ambition
 thou scarlet sin robb'd this bewailing land
 of noble buckingham my fatherinlaw
 the heads of all thy brother cardinals
 with thee and all thy best parts bound together
 weigh'd not a hair of his plague of your policy
 you sent me deputy for ireland
 far from his succor from the king from all
 that might have mercy on the fault thou gavest him
 whilst your great goodness out of holy pity
 absolved him with an axe
cardinal wolsey this and all else
 this talking lord can lay upon my credit
 i answer is most false the duke by law
 found his deserts how innocent i was
 from any private malice in his end
 his noble jury and foul cause can witness
 if i loved many words lord i should tell you
 you have as little honesty as honour
 that in the way of loyalty and truth
 toward the king my ever royal master
 dare mate a sounder man than surrey can be
 and all that love his follies
surrey by my soul
 your long coat priest protects you thou
 shouldst feel
 my sword i the lifeblood of thee else my lords
 can ye endure to hear this arrogance
 and from this fellow if we live thus tamely
 to be thus jaded by a piece of scarlet
 farewell nobility let his grace go forward
 and dare us with his cap like larks
cardinal wolsey all goodness
 is poison to thy stomach
surrey yes that goodness
 of gleaning all the land's wealth into one
 into your own hands cardinal by extortion
 the goodness of your intercepted packets
 you writ to the pope against the king your goodness
 since you provoke me shall be most notorious
 my lord of norfolk as you are truly noble
 as you respect the common good the state
 of our despised nobility our issues
 who if he live will scarce be gentlemen
 produce the grand sum of his sins the articles
 collected from his life i'll startle you
 worse than the scaring bell when the brown wench
 lay kissing in your arms lord cardinal
cardinal wolsey how much methinks i could despise this man
 but that i am bound in charity against it
norfolk those articles my lord are in the king's hand
 but thus much they are foul ones
cardinal wolsey so much fairer
 and spotless shall mine innocence arise
 when the king knows my truth
surrey this cannot save you
 i thank my memory i yet remember
 some of these articles and out they shall
 now if you can blush and cry guilty cardinal
 you'll show a little honesty
cardinal wolsey speak on sir
 i dare your worst objections if i blush
 it is to see a nobleman want manners
surrey i had rather want those than my head have at you
 first that without the king's assent or knowledge
 you wrought to be a legate by which power
 you maim'd the jurisdiction of all bishops
norfolk then that in all you writ to rome or else
 to foreign princes ego et rex meus'
 was still inscribed in which you brought the king
 to be your servant
suffolk then that without the knowledge
 either of king or council when you went
 ambassador to the emperor you made bold
 to carry into flanders the great seal
surrey item you sent a large commission
 to gregory de cassado to conclude
 without the king's will or the state's allowance
 a league between his highness and ferrara
suffolk that out of mere ambition you have caused
 your holy hat to be stamp'd on the king's coin
surrey then that you have sent innumerable substance
 by what means got i leave to your own conscience
 to furnish rome and to prepare the ways
 you have for dignities to the mere undoing
 of all the kingdom many more there are
 which since they are of you and odious
 i will not taint my mouth with
chamberlain o my lord
 press not a falling man too far tis virtue
 his faults lie open to the laws let them
 not you correct him my heart weeps to see him
 so little of his great self
surrey i forgive him
suffolk lord cardinal the king's further pleasure is
 because all those things you have done of late
 by your power legatine within this kingdom
 fall into the compass of a praemunire
 that therefore such a writ be sued against you
 to forfeit all your goods lands tenements
 chattels and whatsoever and to be
 out of the king's protection this is my charge
norfolk and so we'll leave you to your meditations
 how to live better for your stubborn answer
 about the giving back the great seal to us
 the king shall know it and no doubt shall thank you
 so fare you well my little good lord cardinal
 exeunt all but cardinal wolsey
cardinal wolsey so farewell to the little good you bear me
 farewell a long farewell to all my greatness
 this is the state of man today he puts forth
 the tender leaves of hopes tomorrow blossoms
 and bears his blushing honours thick upon him
 the third day comes a frost a killing frost
 and when he thinks good easy man full surely
 his greatness is aripening nips his root
 and then he falls as i do i have ventured
 like little wanton boys that swim on bladders
 this many summers in a sea of glory
 but far beyond my depth my highblown pride
 at length broke under me and now has left me
 weary and old with service to the mercy
 of a rude stream that must for ever hide me
 vain pomp and glory of this world i hate ye
