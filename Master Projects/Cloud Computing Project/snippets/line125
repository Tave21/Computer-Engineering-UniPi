and behold there was a man in jerusalem whose name was simeon and the same man was just and devout waiting for the consolation of israel and the holy ghost was upon him
and it was revealed unto him by the holy ghost that he should not see death before he had seen the lord's christ
and he came by the spirit into the temple and when the parents brought in the child jesus to do for him after the custom of the law
then took he him up in his arms and blessed god and said
lord now lettest thou thy servant depart in peace according to thy word
for mine eyes have seen thy salvation
which thou hast prepared before the face of all people
a light to lighten the gentiles and the glory of thy people israel
and joseph and his mother marvelled at those things which were spoken of him
and simeon blessed them and said unto mary his mother behold this child is set for the fall and rising again of many in israel and for a sign which shall be spoken against
yea a sword shall pierce through thy own soul also that the thoughts of many hearts may be revealed
and there was one anna a prophetess the daughter of phanuel of the tribe of aser she was of a great age and had lived with an husband seven years from her virginity
and she was a widow of about fourscore and four years which departed not from the temple but served god with fastings and prayers night and day
and she coming in that instant gave thanks likewise unto the lord and spake of him to all them that looked for redemption in jerusalem
and when they had performed all things according to the law of the lord they returned into galilee to their own city nazareth
and the child grew and waxed strong in spirit filled with wisdom and the grace of god was upon him
now his parents went to jerusalem every year at the feast of the passover
and when he was twelve years old they went up to jerusalem after the custom of the feast
and when they had fulfilled the days as they returned the child jesus tarried behind in jerusalem and joseph and his mother knew not of it
but they supposing him to have been in the company went a day's journey and they sought him among their kinsfolk and acquaintance
and when they found him not they turned back again to jerusalem seeking him
and it came to pass that after three days they found him in the temple sitting in the midst of the doctors both hearing them and asking them questions
and all that heard him were astonished at his understanding and answers
and when they saw him they were amazed and his mother said unto him son why hast thou thus dealt with us behold thy father and i have sought thee sorrowing
and he said unto them how is it that ye sought me wist ye not that i must be about my father's business
and they understood not the saying which he spake unto them
and he went down with them and came to nazareth and was subject unto them but his mother kept all these sayings in her heart
and jesus increased in wisdom and stature and in favour with god and man
now in the fifteenth year of the reign of tiberius caesar pontius pilate being governor of judaea and herod being tetrarch of galilee and his brother philip tetrarch of ituraea and of the region of trachonitis and lysanias the tetrarch of abilene
annas and caiaphas being the high priests the word of god came unto john the son of zacharias in the wilderness
and he came into all the country about jordan preaching the baptism of repentance for the remission of sins
as it is written in the book of the words of esaias the prophet saying the voice of one crying in the wilderness prepare ye the way of the lord make his paths straight
every valley shall be filled and every mountain and hill shall be brought low and the crooked shall be made straight and the rough ways shall be made smooth
and all flesh shall see the salvation of god
then said he to the multitude that came forth to be baptized of him o generation of vipers who hath warned you to flee from the wrath to come
bring forth therefore fruits worthy of repentance and begin not to say within yourselves we have abraham to our father for i say unto you that god is able of these stones to raise up children unto abraham
and now also the axe is laid unto the root of the trees every tree therefore which bringeth not forth good fruit is hewn down and cast into the fire
and the people asked him saying what shall we do then
he answereth and saith unto them he that hath two coats let him impart to him that hath none and he that hath meat let him do likewise
then came also publicans to be baptized and said unto him master what shall we do
and he said unto them exact no more than that which is appointed you
and the soldiers likewise demanded of him saying and what shall we do and he said unto them do violence to no man neither accuse any falsely and be content with your wages
and as the people were in expectation and all men mused in their hearts of john whether he were the christ or not
john answered saying unto them all i indeed baptize you with water but one mightier than i cometh the latchet of whose shoes i am not worthy to unloose he shall baptize you with the holy ghost and with fire
whose fan is in his hand and he will throughly purge his floor and will gather the wheat into his garner but the chaff he will burn with fire unquenchable
and many other things in his exhortation preached he unto the people
but herod the tetrarch being reproved by him for herodias his brother philip's wife and for all the evils which herod had done
added yet this above all that he shut up john in prison
now when all the people were baptized it came to pass that jesus also being baptized and praying the heaven was opened
and the holy ghost descended in a bodily shape like a dove upon him and a voice came from heaven which said thou art my beloved son in thee i am well pleased
and jesus himself began to be about thirty years of age being as was supposed the son of joseph which was the son of heli
which was the son of matthat which was the son of levi which was the son of melchi which was the son of janna which was the son of joseph
which was the son of mattathias which was the son of amos which was the son of naum which was the son of esli which was the son of nagge
which was the son of maath which was the son of mattathias which was the son of semei which was the son of joseph which was the son of juda
which was the son of joanna which was the son of rhesa which was the son of zorobabel which was the son of salathiel which was the son of neri
which was the son of melchi which was the son of addi which was the son of cosam which was the son of elmodam which was the son of er
which was the son of jose which was the son of eliezer which was the son of jorim which was the son of matthat which was the son of levi
which was the son of simeon which was the son of juda which was the son of joseph which was the son of jonan which was the son of eliakim
which was the son of melea which was the son of menan which was the son of mattatha which was the son of nathan which was the son of david
which was the son of jesse which was the son of obed which was the son of booz which was the son of salmon which was the son of naasson
which was the son of aminadab which was the son of aram which was the son of esrom which was the son of phares which was the son of juda
which was the son of jacob which was the son of isaac which was the son of abraham which was the son of thara which was the son of nachor
which was the son of saruch which was the son of ragau which was the son of phalec which was the son of heber which was the son of sala
which was the son of cainan which was the son of arphaxad which was the son of sem which was the son of noe which was the son of lamech
which was the son of mathusala which was the son of enoch which was the son of jared which was the son of maleleel which was the son of cainan
which was the son of enos which was the son of seth which was the son of adam which was the son of god
and jesus being full of the holy ghost returned from jordan and was led by the spirit into the wilderness
being forty days tempted of the devil and in those days he did eat nothing and when they were ended he afterward hungered
and the devil said unto him if thou be the son of god command this stone that it be made bread
and jesus answered him saying it is written that man shall not live by bread alone but by every word of god
and the devil taking him up into an high mountain shewed unto him all the kingdoms of the world in a moment of time
and the devil said unto him all this power will i give thee and the glory of them for that is delivered unto me and to whomsoever i will i give it
if thou therefore wilt worship me all shall be thine
and jesus answered and said unto him get thee behind me satan for it is written thou shalt worship the lord thy god and him only shalt thou serve
and he brought him to jerusalem and set him on a pinnacle of the temple and said unto him if thou be the son of god cast thyself down from hence
for it is written he shall give his angels charge over thee to keep thee
and in their hands they shall bear thee up lest at any time thou dash thy foot against a stone
and jesus answering said unto him it is said thou shalt not tempt the lord thy god
and when the devil had ended all the temptation he departed from him for a season
and jesus returned in the power of the spirit into galilee and there went out a fame of him through all the region round about
and he taught in their synagogues being glorified of all
and he came to nazareth where he had been brought up and as his custom was he went into the synagogue on the sabbath day and stood up for to read
and there was delivered unto him the book of the prophet esaias and when he had opened the book he found the place where it was written
the spirit of the lord is upon me because he hath anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor he hath sent me to heal the brokenhearted to preach deliverance to the captives and recovering of sight to the blind to set at liberty them that are bruised
to preach the acceptable year of the lord
and he closed the book and he gave it again to the minister and sat down and the eyes of all them that were in the synagogue were fastened on him
and he began to say unto them this day is this scripture fulfilled in your ears
and all bare him witness and wondered at the gracious words which proceeded out of his mouth and they said is not this joseph's son
and he said unto them ye will surely say unto me this proverb physician heal thyself whatsoever we have heard done in capernaum do also here in thy country
and he said verily i say unto you no prophet is accepted in his own country
but i tell you of a truth many widows were in israel in the days of elias when the heaven was shut up three years and six months when great famine was throughout all the land
but unto none of them was elias sent save unto sarepta a city of sidon unto a woman that was a widow
and many lepers were in israel in the time of eliseus the prophet and none of them was cleansed saving naaman the syrian
and all they in the synagogue when they heard these things were filled with wrath
and rose up and thrust him out of the city and led him unto the brow of the hill whereon their city was built that they might cast him down headlong
but he passing through the midst of them went his way
and came down to capernaum a city of galilee and taught them on the sabbath days
and they were astonished at his doctrine for his word was with power
and in the synagogue there was a man which had a spirit of an unclean devil and cried out with a loud voice
saying let us alone what have we to do with thee thou jesus of nazareth art thou come to destroy us i know thee who thou art the holy one of god
and jesus rebuked him saying hold thy peace and come out of him and when the devil had thrown him in the midst he came out of him and hurt him not
and they were all amazed and spake among themselves saying what a word is this for with authority and power he commandeth the unclean spirits and they come out
and the fame of him went out into every place of the country round about
and he arose out of the synagogue and entered into simon's house and simon's wife's mother was taken with a great fever and they besought him for her
and he stood over her and rebuked the fever and it left her and immediately she arose and ministered unto them
now when the sun was setting all they that had any sick with divers diseases brought them unto him and he laid his hands on every one of them and healed them
and devils also came out of many crying out and saying thou art christ the son of god and he rebuking them suffered them not to speak for they knew that he was christ
and when it was day he departed and went into a desert place and the people sought him and came unto him and stayed him that he should not depart from them
and he said unto them i must preach the kingdom of god to other cities also for therefore am i sent
and he preached in the synagogues of galilee
and it came to pass that as the people pressed upon him to hear the word of god he stood by the lake of gennesaret
and saw two ships standing by the lake but the fishermen were gone out of them and were washing their nets
and he entered into one of the ships which was simon's and prayed him that he would thrust out a little from the land and he sat down and taught the people out of the ship
now when he had left speaking he said unto simon launch out into the deep and let down your nets for a draught
and simon answering said unto him master we have toiled all the night and have taken nothing nevertheless at thy word i will let down the net
and when they had this done they inclosed a great multitude of fishes and their net brake
and they beckoned unto their partners which were in the other ship that they should come and help them and they came and filled both the ships so that they began to sink
when simon peter saw it he fell down at jesus knees saying depart from me for i am a sinful man o lord
for he was astonished and all that were with him at the draught of the fishes which they had taken
and so was also james and john the sons of zebedee which were partners with simon and jesus said unto simon fear not from henceforth thou shalt catch men
and when they had brought their ships to land they forsook all and followed him
and it came to pass when he was in a certain city behold a man full of leprosy who seeing jesus fell on his face and besought him saying lord if thou wilt thou canst make me clean
and he put forth his hand and touched him saying i will be thou clean and immediately the leprosy departed from him
and he charged him to tell no man but go and shew thyself to the priest and offer for thy cleansing according as moses commanded for a testimony unto them
but so much the more went there a fame abroad of him and great multitudes came together to hear and to be healed by him of their infirmities
and he withdrew himself into the wilderness and prayed
and it came to pass on a certain day as he was teaching that there were pharisees and doctors of the law sitting by which were come out of every town of galilee and judaea and jerusalem and the power of the lord was present to heal them
and behold men brought in a bed a man which was taken with a palsy and they sought means to bring him in and to lay him before him
and when they could not find by what way they might bring him in because of the multitude they went upon the housetop and let him down through the tiling with his couch into the midst before jesus
and when he saw their faith he said unto him man thy sins are forgiven thee
and the scribes and the pharisees began to reason saying who is this which speaketh blasphemies who can forgive sins but god alone
but when jesus perceived their thoughts he answering said unto them what reason ye in your hearts
whether is easier to say thy sins be forgiven thee or to say rise up and walk
but that ye may know that the son of man hath power upon earth to forgive sins he said unto the sick of the palsy i say unto thee arise and take up thy couch and go into thine house
and immediately he rose up before them and took up that whereon he lay and departed to his own house glorifying god
and they were all amazed and they glorified god and were filled with fear saying we have seen strange things to day
and after these things he went forth and saw a publican named levi sitting at the receipt of custom and he said unto him follow me
and he left all rose up and followed him
and levi made him a great feast in his own house and there was a great company of publicans and of others that sat down with them
but their scribes and pharisees murmured against his disciples saying why do ye eat and drink with publicans and sinners
and jesus answering said unto them they that are whole need not a physician but they that are sick
i came not to call the righteous but sinners to repentance
and they said unto him why do the disciples of john fast often and make prayers and likewise the disciples of the pharisees but thine eat and drink
and he said unto them can ye make the children of the bridechamber fast while the bridegroom is with them
but the days will come when the bridegroom shall be taken away from them and then shall they fast in those days
and he spake also a parable unto them no man putteth a piece of a new garment upon an old if otherwise then both the new maketh a rent and the piece that was taken out of the new agreeth not with the old
and no man putteth new wine into old bottles else the new wine will burst the bottles and be spilled and the bottles shall perish
but new wine must be put into new bottles and both are preserved
no man also having drunk old wine straightway desireth new for he saith the old is better
and it came to pass on the second sabbath after the first that he went through the corn fields and his disciples plucked the ears of corn and did eat rubbing them in their hands
and certain of the pharisees said unto them why do ye that which is not lawful to do on the sabbath days
and jesus answering them said have ye not read so much as this what david did when himself was an hungred and they which were with him
how he went into the house of god and did take and eat the shewbread and gave also to them that were with him which it is not lawful to eat but for the priests alone
and he said unto them that the son of man is lord also of the sabbath
and it came to pass also on another sabbath that he entered into the synagogue and taught and there was a man whose right hand was withered
and the scribes and pharisees watched him whether he would heal on the sabbath day that they might find an accusation against him
but he knew their thoughts and said to the man which had the withered hand rise up and stand forth in the midst and he arose and stood forth
then said jesus unto them i will ask you one thing is it lawful on the sabbath days to do good or to do evil to save life or to destroy it
and looking round about upon them all he said unto the man stretch forth thy hand and he did so and his hand was restored whole as the other
and they were filled with madness and communed one with another what they might do to jesus
and it came to pass in those days that he went out into a mountain to pray and continued all night in prayer to god
and when it was day he called unto him his disciples and of them he chose twelve whom also he named apostles
simon whom he also named peter and andrew his brother james and john philip and bartholomew
matthew and thomas james the son of alphaeus and simon called zelotes
and judas the brother of james and judas iscariot which also was the traitor
and he came down with them and stood in the plain and the company of his disciples and a great multitude of people out of all judaea and jerusalem and from the sea coast of tyre and sidon which came to hear him and to be healed of their diseases
and they that were vexed with unclean spirits and they were healed
and the whole multitude sought to touch him for there went virtue out of him and healed them all
and he lifted up his eyes on his disciples and said blessed be ye poor for yours is the kingdom of god
blessed are ye that hunger now for ye shall be filled blessed are ye that weep now for ye shall laugh
blessed are ye when men shall hate you and when they shall separate you from their company and shall reproach you and cast out your name as evil for the son of man's sake
rejoice ye in that day and leap for joy for behold your reward is great in heaven for in the like manner did their fathers unto the prophets
but woe unto you that are rich for ye have received your consolation
woe unto you that are full for ye shall hunger woe unto you that laugh now for ye shall mourn and weep
woe unto you when all men shall speak well of you for so did their fathers to the false prophets
but i say unto you which hear love your enemies do good to them which hate you
bless them that curse you and pray for them which despitefully use you
and unto him that smiteth thee on the one cheek offer also the other and him that taketh away thy cloak forbid not to take thy coat also
give to every man that asketh of thee and of him that taketh away thy goods ask them not again
and as ye would that men should do to you do ye also to them likewise
for if ye love them which love you what thank have ye for sinners also love those that love them
and if ye do good to them which do good to you what thank have ye for sinners also do even the same
and if ye lend to them of whom ye hope to receive what thank have ye for sinners also lend to sinners to receive as much again
but love ye your enemies and do good and lend hoping for nothing again and your reward shall be great and ye shall be the children of the highest for he is kind unto the unthankful and to the evil
be ye therefore merciful as your father also is merciful
judge not and ye shall not be judged condemn not and ye shall not be condemned forgive and ye shall be forgiven
give and it shall be given unto you good measure pressed down and shaken together and running over shall men give into your bosom for with the same measure that ye mete withal it shall be measured to you again
and he spake a parable unto them can the blind lead the blind shall they not both fall into the ditch
the disciple is not above his master but every one that is perfect shall be as his master
and why beholdest thou the mote that is in thy brother's eye but perceivest not the beam that is in thine own eye
either how canst thou say to thy brother brother let me pull out the mote that is in thine eye when thou thyself beholdest not the beam that is in thine own eye thou hypocrite cast out first the beam out of thine own eye and then shalt thou see clearly to pull out the mote that is in thy brother's eye
for a good tree bringeth not forth corrupt fruit neither doth a corrupt tree bring forth good fruit
for every tree is known by his own fruit for of thorns men do not gather figs nor of a bramble bush gather they grapes
a good man out of the good treasure of his heart bringeth forth that which is good and an evil man out of the evil treasure of his heart bringeth forth that which is evil for of the abundance of the heart his mouth speaketh
and why call ye me lord lord and do not the things which i say
whosoever cometh to me and heareth my sayings and doeth them i will shew you to whom he is like
he is like a man which built an house and digged deep and laid the foundation on a rock and when the flood arose the stream beat vehemently upon that house and could not shake it for it was founded upon a rock
but he that heareth and doeth not is like a man that without a foundation built an house upon the earth against which the stream did beat vehemently and immediately it fell and the ruin of that house was great
now when he had ended all his sayings in the audience of the people he entered into capernaum
and a certain centurion's servant who was dear unto him was sick and ready to die
