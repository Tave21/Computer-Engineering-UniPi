 now thou art gone we have no staff no stay
 o clifford boisterous clifford thou hast slain
 the flower of europe for his chivalry
 and treacherously hast thou vanquish'd him
 for hand to hand he would have vanquish'd thee
 now my soul's palace is become a prison
 ah would she break from hence that this my body
 might in the ground be closed up in rest
 for never henceforth shall i joy again
 never o never shall i see more joy
richard i cannot weep for all my body's moisture
 scarce serves to quench my furnaceburning heart
 nor can my tongue unload my heart's great burthen
 for selfsame wind that i should speak withal
 is kindling coals that fires all my breast
 and burns me up with flames that tears would quench
 to weep is to make less the depth of grief
 tears then for babes blows and revenge for me
 richard i bear thy name i'll venge thy death
 or die renowned by attempting it
edward his name that valiant duke hath left with thee
 his dukedom and his chair with me is left
richard nay if thou be that princely eagle's bird
 show thy descent by gazing gainst the sun
 for chair and dukedom throne and kingdom say
 either that is thine or else thou wert not his
 march enter warwick montague and their army
warwick how now fair lords what fare what news abroad
richard great lord of warwick if we should recount
 our baleful news and at each word's deliverance
 stab poniards in our flesh till all were told
 the words would add more anguish than the wounds
 o valiant lord the duke of york is slain
edward o warwick warwick that plantagenet
 which held three dearly as his soul's redemption
 is by the stern lord clifford done to death
warwick ten days ago i drown'd these news in tears
 and now to add more measure to your woes
 i come to tell you things sith then befall'n
 after the bloody fray at wakefield fought
 where your brave father breathed his latest gasp
 tidings as swiftly as the posts could run
 were brought me of your loss and his depart
 i then in london keeper of the king
 muster'd my soldiers gather'd flocks of friends
 and very well appointed as i thought
 march'd toward saint alban's to intercept the queen
 bearing the king in my behalf along
 for by my scouts i was advertised
 that she was coming with a full intent
 to dash our late decree in parliament
 touching king henry's oath and your succession
 short tale to make we at saint alban's met
 our battles join'd and both sides fiercely fought
 but whether twas the coldness of the king
 who look'd full gently on his warlike queen
 that robb'd my soldiers of their heated spleen
 or whether twas report of her success
 or more than common fear of clifford's rigour
 who thunders to his captives blood and death
 i cannot judge but to conclude with truth
 their weapons like to lightning came and went
 our soldiers like the nightowl's lazy flight
 or like an idle thresher with a flail
 fell gently down as if they struck their friends
 i cheer'd them up with justice of our cause
 with promise of high pay and great rewards
 but all in vain they had no heart to fight
 and we in them no hope to win the day
 so that we fled the king unto the queen
 lord george your brother norfolk and myself
 in haste posthaste are come to join with you
 for in the marches here we heard you were
 making another head to fight again
edward where is the duke of norfolk gentle warwick
 and when came george from burgundy to england
warwick some six miles off the duke is with the soldiers
 and for your brother he was lately sent
 from your kind aunt duchess of burgundy
 with aid of soldiers to this needful war
richard twas odds belike when valiant warwick fled
 oft have i heard his praises in pursuit
 but ne'er till now his scandal of retire
warwick nor now my scandal richard dost thou hear
 for thou shalt know this strong right hand of mine
 can pluck the diadem from faint henry's head
 and wring the awful sceptre from his fist
 were he as famous and as bold in war
 as he is famed for mildness peace and prayer
richard i know it well lord warwick blame me not
 tis love i bear thy glories makes me speak
 but in this troublous time what's to be done
 shall we go throw away our coats of steel
 and wrap our bodies in black mourning gowns
 numbering our avemaries with our beads
 or shall we on the helmets of our foes
 tell our devotion with revengeful arms
 if for the last say ay and to it lords
warwick why therefore warwick came to seek you out
 and therefore comes my brother montague
 attend me lords the proud insulting queen
 with clifford and the haught northumberland
 and of their feather many more proud birds
 have wrought the easymelting king like wax
 he swore consent to your succession
 his oath enrolled in the parliament
 and now to london all the crew are gone
 to frustrate both his oath and what beside
 may make against the house of lancaster
 their power i think is thirty thousand strong
 now if the help of norfolk and myself
 with all the friends that thou brave earl of march
 amongst the loving welshmen canst procure
 will but amount to five and twenty thousand
 why via to london will we march amain
 and once again bestride our foaming steeds
 and once again cry charge upon our foes'
 but never once again turn back and fly
richard ay now methinks i hear great warwick speak
 ne'er may he live to see a sunshine day
 that cries retire if warwick bid him stay
edward lord warwick on thy shoulder will i lean
 and when thou fail'stas god forbid the hour
 must edward fall which peril heaven forfend
warwick no longer earl of march but duke of york
 the next degree is england's royal throne
 for king of england shalt thou be proclaim'd
 in every borough as we pass along
 and he that throws not up his cap for joy
 shall for the fault make forfeit of his head
 king edward valiant richard montague
 stay we no longer dreaming of renown
 but sound the trumpets and about our task
richard then clifford were thy heart as hard as steel
 as thou hast shown it flinty by thy deeds
 i come to pierce it or to give thee mine
edward then strike up drums god and saint george for us
 enter a messenger
warwick how now what news
messenger the duke of norfolk sends you word by me
 the queen is coming with a puissant host
 and craves your company for speedy counsel
warwick why then it sorts brave warriors let's away
 exeunt
 3 king henry vi
act ii
scene ii before york
 flourish enter king henry vi queen margaret
 prince edward clifford and northumberland with
 drum and trumpets
queen margaret welcome my lord to this brave town of york
 yonder's the head of that archenemy
 that sought to be encompass'd with your crown
 doth not the object cheer your heart my lord
king henry vi ay as the rocks cheer them that fear their wreck
 to see this sight it irks my very soul
 withhold revenge dear god tis not my fault
 nor wittingly have i infringed my vow
clifford my gracious liege this too much lenity
 and harmful pity must be laid aside
 to whom do lions cast their gentle looks
 not to the beast that would usurp their den
 whose hand is that the forest bear doth lick
 not his that spoils her young before her face
 who scapes the lurking serpent's mortal sting
 not he that sets his foot upon her back
 the smallest worm will turn being trodden on
 and doves will peck in safeguard of their brood
 ambitious york doth level at thy crown
 thou smiling while he knit his angry brows
 he but a duke would have his son a king
 and raise his issue like a loving sire
 thou being a king blest with a goodly son
 didst yield consent to disinherit him
 which argued thee a most unloving father
 unreasonable creatures feed their young
 and though man's face be fearful to their eyes
 yet in protection of their tender ones
 who hath not seen them even with those wings
 which sometime they have used with fearful flight
 make war with him that climb'd unto their nest
 offer their own lives in their young's defence
 for shame my liege make them your precedent
 were it not pity that this goodly boy
 should lose his birthright by his father's fault
 and long hereafter say unto his child
 what my greatgrandfather and his grandsire got
 my careless father fondly gave away'
 ah what a shame were this look on the boy
 and let his manly face which promiseth
 successful fortune steel thy melting heart
 to hold thine own and leave thine own with him
king henry vi full well hath clifford play'd the orator
 inferring arguments of mighty force
 but clifford tell me didst thou never hear
 that things illgot had ever bad success
 and happy always was it for that son
 whose father for his hoarding went to hell
 i'll leave my son my virtuous deeds behind
 and would my father had left me no more
