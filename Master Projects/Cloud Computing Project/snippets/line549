 and what strength i have's mine own
 which is most faint now tis true
 i must be here confined by you
 or sent to naples let me not
 since i have my dukedom got
 and pardon'd the deceiver dwell
 in this bare island by your spell
 but release me from my bands
 with the help of your good hands
 gentle breath of yours my sails
 must fill or else my project fails
 which was to please now i want
 spirits to enforce art to enchant
 and my ending is despair
 unless i be relieved by prayer
 which pierces so that it assaults
 mercy itself and frees all faults
 as you from crimes would pardon'd be
 let your indulgence set me free

 troilus and cressida
 prologue
 in troy there lies the scene from isles of greece
 the princes orgulous their high blood chafed
 have to the port of athens sent their ships
 fraught with the ministers and instruments
 of cruel war sixty and nine that wore
 their crownets regal from the athenian bay
 put forth toward phrygia and their vow is made
 to ransack troy within whose strong immures
 the ravish'd helen menelaus queen
 with wanton paris sleeps and that's the quarrel
 to tenedos they come
 and the deepdrawing barks do there disgorge
 their warlike fraughtage now on dardan plains
 the fresh and yet unbruised greeks do pitch
 their brave pavilions priam's sixgated city
 dardan and tymbria helias chetas troien
 and antenorides with massy staples
 and corresponsive and fulfilling bolts
 sperr up the sons of troy
 now expectation tickling skittish spirits
 on one and other side trojan and greek
 sets all on hazard and hither am i come
 a prologue arm'd but not in confidence
 of author's pen or actor's voice but suited
 in like conditions as our argument
 to tell you fair beholders that our play
 leaps o'er the vaunt and firstlings of those broils
 beginning in the middle starting thence away
 to what may be digested in a play
 like or find fault do as your pleasures are
 now good or bad tis but the chance of war
 troilus and cressida
act i
scene i troy before priam's palace
 enter troilus armed and pandarus
troilus call here my varlet i'll unarm again
 why should i war without the walls of troy
 that find such cruel battle here within
 each trojan that is master of his heart
 let him to field troilus alas hath none
pandarus will this gear ne'er be mended
troilus the greeks are strong and skilful to their strength
 fierce to their skill and to their fierceness valiant
 but i am weaker than a woman's tear
 tamer than sleep fonder than ignorance
 less valiant than the virgin in the night
 and skilless as unpractised infancy
pandarus well i have told you enough of this for my part
 i'll not meddle nor make no further he that will
 have a cake out of the wheat must needs tarry the grinding
troilus have i not tarried
pandarus ay the grinding but you must tarry
 the bolting
troilus have i not tarried
pandarus ay the bolting but you must tarry the leavening
troilus still have i tarried
pandarus ay to the leavening but here's yet in the word
 hereafter the kneading the making of the cake the
 heating of the oven and the baking nay you must
 stay the cooling too or you may chance to burn your lips
troilus patience herself what goddess e'er she be
 doth lesser blench at sufferance than i do
 at priam's royal table do i sit
 and when fair cressid comes into my thoughts
 so traitor when she comes when is she thence
pandarus well she looked yesternight fairer than ever i saw
 her look or any woman else
troilus i was about to tell theewhen my heart
 as wedged with a sigh would rive in twain
 lest hector or my father should perceive me
 i have as when the sun doth light a storm
 buried this sigh in wrinkle of a smile
 but sorrow that is couch'd in seeming gladness
 is like that mirth fate turns to sudden sadness
pandarus an her hair were not somewhat darker than helen's
 well go tothere were no more comparison between
 the women but for my part she is my kinswoman i
 would not as they term it praise her but i would
 somebody had heard her talk yesterday as i did i
 will not dispraise your sister cassandra's wit but
troilus o pandarus i tell thee pandarus
 when i do tell thee there my hopes lie drown'd
 reply not in how many fathoms deep
 they lie indrench'd i tell thee i am mad
 in cressid's love thou answer'st she is fair'
 pour'st in the open ulcer of my heart
 her eyes her hair her cheek her gait her voice
 handlest in thy discourse o that her hand
 in whose comparison all whites are ink
 writing their own reproach to whose soft seizure
 the cygnet's down is harsh and spirit of sense
 hard as the palm of ploughman this thou tell'st me
 as true thou tell'st me when i say i love her
 but saying thus instead of oil and balm
 thou lay'st in every gash that love hath given me
 the knife that made it
pandarus i speak no more than truth
troilus thou dost not speak so much
pandarus faith i'll not meddle in't let her be as she is
 if she be fair tis the better for her an she be
 not she has the mends in her own hands
troilus good pandarus how now pandarus
pandarus i have had my labour for my travail illthought on of
 her and illthought on of you gone between and
 between but small thanks for my labour
troilus what art thou angry pandarus what with me
pandarus because she's kin to me therefore she's not so fair
 as helen an she were not kin to me she would be as
 fair on friday as helen is on sunday but what care
 i i care not an she were a blackamoor tis all one to me
troilus say i she is not fair
pandarus i do not care whether you do or no she's a fool to
 stay behind her father let her to the greeks and so
 i'll tell her the next time i see her for my part
 i'll meddle nor make no more i the matter
troilus pandarus
pandarus not i
troilus sweet pandarus
pandarus pray you speak no more to me i will leave all as i
 found it and there an end
 exit pandarus an alarum
troilus peace you ungracious clamours peace rude sounds
 fools on both sides helen must needs be fair
 when with your blood you daily paint her thus
 i cannot fight upon this argument
 it is too starved a subject for my sword
 but pandaruso gods how do you plague me
 i cannot come to cressid but by pandar
 and he's as tetchy to be woo'd to woo
 as she is stubbornchaste against all suit
 tell me apollo for thy daphne's love
 what cressid is what pandar and what we
 her bed is india there she lies a pearl
 between our ilium and where she resides
 let it be call'd the wild and wandering flood
 ourself the merchant and this sailing pandar
 our doubtful hope our convoy and our bark
