 and the great hector's sword had lack'd a master
 but for these instances
 the specialty of rule hath been neglected
 and look how many grecian tents do stand
 hollow upon this plain so many hollow factions
 when that the general is not like the hive
 to whom the foragers shall all repair
 what honey is expected degree being vizarded
 the unworthiest shows as fairly in the mask
 the heavens themselves the planets and this centre
 observe degree priority and place
 insisture course proportion season form
 office and custom in all line of order
 and therefore is the glorious planet sol
 in noble eminence enthroned and sphered
 amidst the other whose medicinable eye
 corrects the ill aspects of planets evil
 and posts like the commandment of a king
 sans cheque to good and bad but when the planets
 in evil mixture to disorder wander
 what plagues and what portents what mutiny
 what raging of the sea shaking of earth
 commotion in the winds frights changes horrors
 divert and crack rend and deracinate
 the unity and married calm of states
 quite from their fixure o when degree is shaked
 which is the ladder to all high designs
 then enterprise is sick how could communities
 degrees in schools and brotherhoods in cities
 peaceful commerce from dividable shores
 the primogenitive and due of birth
 prerogative of age crowns sceptres laurels
 but by degree stand in authentic place
 take but degree away untune that string
 and hark what discord follows each thing meets
 in mere oppugnancy the bounded waters
 should lift their bosoms higher than the shores
 and make a sop of all this solid globe
 strength should be lord of imbecility
 and the rude son should strike his father dead
 force should be right or rather right and wrong
 between whose endless jar justice resides
 should lose their names and so should justice too
 then every thing includes itself in power
 power into will will into appetite
 and appetite an universal wolf
 so doubly seconded with will and power
 must make perforce an universal prey
 and last eat up himself great agamemnon
 this chaos when degree is suffocate
 follows the choking
 and this neglection of degree it is
 that by a pace goes backward with a purpose
 it hath to climb the general's disdain'd
 by him one step below he by the next
 that next by him beneath so every step
 exampled by the first pace that is sick
 of his superior grows to an envious fever
 of pale and bloodless emulation
 and tis this fever that keeps troy on foot
 not her own sinews to end a tale of length
 troy in our weakness stands not in her strength
nestor most wisely hath ulysses here discover'd
 the fever whereof all our power is sick
agamemnon the nature of the sickness found ulysses
 what is the remedy
ulysses the great achilles whom opinion crowns
 the sinew and the forehand of our host
 having his ear full of his airy fame
 grows dainty of his worth and in his tent
 lies mocking our designs with him patroclus
 upon a lazy bed the livelong day
 breaks scurril jests
 and with ridiculous and awkward action
 which slanderer he imitation calls
 he pageants us sometime great agamemnon
 thy topless deputation he puts on
 and like a strutting player whose conceit
 lies in his hamstring and doth think it rich
 to hear the wooden dialogue and sound
 twixt his stretch'd footing and the scaffoldage
 such tobepitied and o'erwrested seeming
 he acts thy greatness in and when he speaks
 tis like a chime amending with terms unsquared
 which from the tongue of roaring typhon dropp'd
 would seem hyperboles at this fusty stuff
 the large achilles on his press'd bed lolling
 from his deep chest laughs out a loud applause
 cries excellent tis agamemnon just
 now play me nestor hem and stroke thy beard
 as he being drest to some oration'
 that's done as near as the extremest ends
 of parallels as like as vulcan and his wife
 yet god achilles still cries excellent
 tis nestor right now play him me patroclus
 arming to answer in a night alarm'
 and then forsooth the faint defects of age
 must be the scene of mirth to cough and spit
 and with a palsyfumbling on his gorget
 shake in and out the rivet and at this sport
 sir valour dies cries o enough patroclus
 or give me ribs of steel i shall split all
 in pleasure of my spleen and in this fashion
 all our abilities gifts natures shapes
 severals and generals of grace exact
 achievements plots orders preventions
 excitements to the field or speech for truce
 success or loss what is or is not serves
 as stuff for these two to make paradoxes
nestor and in the imitation of these twain
 who as ulysses says opinion crowns
 with an imperial voicemany are infect
 ajax is grown selfwill'd and bears his head
 in such a rein in full as proud a place
 as broad achilles keeps his tent like him
 makes factious feasts rails on our state of war
 bold as an oracle and sets thersites
 a slave whose gall coins slanders like a mint
 to match us in comparisons with dirt
 to weaken and discredit our exposure
 how rank soever rounded in with danger
ulysses they tax our policy and call it cowardice
 count wisdom as no member of the war
 forestall prescience and esteem no act
 but that of hand the still and mental parts
 that do contrive how many hands shall strike
 when fitness calls them on and know by measure
 of their observant toil the enemies weight
 why this hath not a finger's dignity
 they call this bedwork mappery closetwar
 so that the ram that batters down the wall
 for the great swing and rudeness of his poise
 they place before his hand that made the engine
 or those that with the fineness of their souls
 by reason guide his execution
nestor let this be granted and achilles horse
 makes many thetis sons
 a tucket
agamemnon what trumpet look menelaus
menelaus from troy
 enter aeneas
agamemnon what would you fore our tent
aeneas is this great agamemnon's tent i pray you
agamemnon even this
aeneas may one that is a herald and a prince
 do a fair message to his kingly ears
agamemnon with surety stronger than achilles arm
 fore all the greekish heads which with one voice
 call agamemnon head and general
aeneas fair leave and large security how may
 a stranger to those most imperial looks
 know them from eyes of other mortals
agamemnon how
aeneas ay
 i ask that i might waken reverence
 and bid the cheek be ready with a blush
 modest as morning when she coldly eyes
 the youthful phoebus
 which is that god in office guiding men
 which is the high and mighty agamemnon
agamemnon this trojan scorns us or the men of troy
 are ceremonious courtiers
aeneas courtiers as free as debonair unarm'd
 as bending angels that's their fame in peace
 but when they would seem soldiers they have galls
 good arms strong joints true swords and
 jove's accord
 nothing so full of heart but peace aeneas
 peace trojan lay thy finger on thy lips
 the worthiness of praise distains his worth
 if that the praised himself bring the praise forth
 but what the repining enemy commends
 that breath fame blows that praise sole sure
 transcends
agamemnon sir you of troy call you yourself aeneas
aeneas ay greek that is my name
agamemnon what's your affair i pray you
aeneas sir pardon tis for agamemnon's ears
agamemnon he hears naught privately that comes from troy
aeneas nor i from troy come not to whisper him
 i bring a trumpet to awake his ear
 to set his sense on the attentive bent
 and then to speak
agamemnon speak frankly as the wind
 it is not agamemnon's sleeping hour
 that thou shalt know trojan he is awake
 he tells thee so himself
aeneas trumpet blow loud
 send thy brass voice through all these lazy tents
 and every greek of mettle let him know
 what troy means fairly shall be spoke aloud
 trumpet sounds
 we have great agamemnon here in troy
 a prince call'd hectorpriam is his father
 who in this dull and longcontinued truce
 is rusty grown he bade me take a trumpet
 and to this purpose speak kings princes lords
 if there be one among the fair'st of greece
 that holds his honour higher than his ease
 that seeks his praise more than he fears his peril
