scene viii southwark
 alarum and retreat enter cade and all his
 rabblement
cade up fish street down saint magnus corner kill
 and knock down throw them into thames
 sound a parley
 what noise is this i hear dare any be so bold to
 sound retreat or parley when i command them kill
 enter buckingham and clifford attended
buckingham ay here they be that dare and will disturb thee
 know cade we come ambassadors from the king
 unto the commons whom thou hast misled
 and here pronounce free pardon to them all
 that will forsake thee and go home in peace
clifford what say ye countrymen will ye relent
 and yield to mercy whilst tis offer'd you
 or let a rebel lead you to your deaths
 who loves the king and will embrace his pardon
 fling up his cap and say god save his majesty'
 who hateth him and honours not his father
 henry the fifth that made all france to quake
 shake he his weapon at us and pass by
all god save the king god save the king
cade what buckingham and clifford are ye so brave and
 you base peasants do ye believe him will you
 needs be hanged with your pardons about your necks
 hath my sword therefore broke through london gates
 that you should leave me at the white hart in
 southwark i thought ye would never have given out
 these arms till you had recovered your ancient
 freedom but you are all recreants and dastards
 and delight to live in slavery to the nobility let
 them break your backs with burthens take your
 houses over your heads ravish your wives and
 daughters before your faces for me i will make
 shift for one and so god's curse light upon you
 all
all we'll follow cade we'll follow cade
clifford is cade the son of henry the fifth
 that thus you do exclaim you'll go with him
 will he conduct you through the heart of france
 and make the meanest of you earls and dukes
 alas he hath no home no place to fly to
 nor knows he how to live but by the spoil
 unless by robbing of your friends and us
 were't not a shame that whilst you live at jar
 the fearful french whom you late vanquished
 should make a start o'er seas and vanquish you
 methinks already in this civil broil
 i see them lording it in london streets
 crying villiago unto all they meet
 better ten thousand baseborn cades miscarry
 than you should stoop unto a frenchman's mercy
 to france to france and get what you have lost
 spare england for it is your native coast
 henry hath money you are strong and manly
 god on our side doubt not of victory
all a clifford a clifford we'll follow the king and clifford
cade was ever feather so lightly blown to and fro as this
 multitude the name of henry the fifth hales them
 to an hundred mischiefs and makes them leave me
 desolate i see them lay their heads together to
 surprise me my sword make way for me for here is
 no staying in despite of the devils and hell have
 through the very middest of you and heavens and
 honour be witness that no want of resolution in me
 but only my followers base and ignominious
 treasons makes me betake me to my heels
 exit
buckingham what is he fled go some and follow him
 and he that brings his head unto the king
 shall have a thousand crowns for his reward
 exeunt some of them
 follow me soldiers we'll devise a mean
 to reconcile you all unto the king

scene x kent iden's garden
 enter cade
cade fie on ambition fie on myself that have a sword
 and yet am ready to famish these five days have i
 hid me in these woods and durst not peep out for
 all the country is laid for me but now am i so
 hungry that if i might have a lease of my life for a
 thousand years i could stay no longer wherefore
 on a brick wall have i climbed into this garden to
 see if i can eat grass or pick a sallet another
 while which is not amiss to cool a man's stomach
 this hot weather and i think this word sallet'
 was born to do me good for many a time but for a
 sallet my brainpan had been cleft with a brown
 bill and many a time when i have been dry and
 bravely marching it hath served me instead of a
 quart pot to drink in and now the word sallet'
 must serve me to feed on

iden lord who would live turmoiled in the court
 and may enjoy such quiet walks as these
 this small inheritance my father left me
 contenteth me and worth a monarchy
 i seek not to wax great by others waning
 or gather wealth i care not with what envy
 sufficeth that i have maintains my state
 and sends the poor well pleased from my gate

 stray for entering his feesimple without leave

 crowns of the king carrying my head to him but

 my sword like a great pin ere thou and i part
iden why rude companion whatsoe'er thou be
 i know thee not why then should i betray thee

 and like a thief to come to rob my grounds
 climbing my walls in spite of me the owner
 but thou wilt brave me with these saucy terms
cade brave thee ay by the best blood that ever was
 broached and beard thee too look on me well i
 have eat no meat these five days yet come thou and
 thy five men and if i do not leave you all as dead
 as a doornail i pray god i may never eat grass more
iden nay it shall ne'er be said while england stands
 that alexander iden an esquire of kent
 took odds to combat a poor famish'd man
 oppose thy steadfastgazing eyes to mine
 see if thou canst outface me with thy looks
 set limb to limb and thou art far the lesser
 thy hand is but a finger to my fist
 thy leg a stick compared with this truncheon
 my foot shall fight with all the strength thou hast
 and if mine arm be heaved in the air
 thy grave is digg'd already in the earth
 as for words whose greatness answers words
 let this my sword report what speech forbears
cade by my valour the most complete champion that ever i
