 her than she'll demand
steward madam i was very late more near her than i think
 she wished me alone she was and did communicate
 to herself her own words to her own ears she
 thought i dare vow for her they touched not any
 stranger sense her matter was she loved your son
 fortune she said was no goddess that had put
 such difference betwixt their two estates love no
 god that would not extend his might only where
 qualities were level dian no queen of virgins that
 would suffer her poor knight surprised without
 rescue in the first assault or ransom afterward
 this she delivered in the most bitter touch of
 sorrow that e'er i heard virgin exclaim in which i
 held my duty speedily to acquaint you withal
 sithence in the loss that may happen it concerns
 you something to know it
countess you have discharged this honestly keep it to
 yourself many likelihoods informed me of this
 before which hung so tottering in the balance that
 i could neither believe nor misdoubt pray you
 leave me stall this in your bosom and i thank you
 for your honest care i will speak with you further anon
 exit steward
 enter helena
 even so it was with me when i was young
 if ever we are nature's these are ours this thorn
 doth to our rose of youth rightly belong
 our blood to us this to our blood is born
 it is the show and seal of nature's truth
 where love's strong passion is impress'd in youth
 by our remembrances of days foregone
 such were our faults or then we thought them none
 her eye is sick on't i observe her now
helena what is your pleasure madam
countess you know helen
 i am a mother to you
helena mine honourable mistress
countess nay a mother
 why not a mother when i said a mother'
 methought you saw a serpent what's in mother'
 that you start at it i say i am your mother
 and put you in the catalogue of those
 that were enwombed mine tis often seen
 adoption strives with nature and choice breeds
 a native slip to us from foreign seeds
 you ne'er oppress'd me with a mother's groan
 yet i express to you a mother's care
 god's mercy maiden does it curd thy blood
 to say i am thy mother what's the matter
 that this distemper'd messenger of wet
 the manycolour'd iris rounds thine eye
 why that you are my daughter
helena that i am not
countess i say i am your mother
helena pardon madam
 the count rousillon cannot be my brother
 i am from humble he from honour'd name
 no note upon my parents his all noble
 my master my dear lord he is and i
 his servant live and will his vassal die
 he must not be my brother
countess nor i your mother
helena you are my mother madam would you were
 so that my lord your son were not my brother
 indeed my mother or were you both our mothers
 i care no more for than i do for heaven
 so i were not his sister can't no other
 but i your daughter he must be my brother
countess yes helen you might be my daughterinlaw
 god shield you mean it not daughter and mother
 so strive upon your pulse what pale again
 my fear hath catch'd your fondness now i see
 the mystery of your loneliness and find
 your salt tears head now to all sense tis gross
 you love my son invention is ashamed
 against the proclamation of thy passion
 to say thou dost not therefore tell me true
 but tell me then tis so for look thy cheeks
 confess it th one to th other and thine eyes
 see it so grossly shown in thy behaviors
 that in their kind they speak it only sin
 and hellish obstinacy tie thy tongue
 that truth should be suspected speak is't so
 if it be so you have wound a goodly clew
 if it be not forswear't howe'er i charge thee
 as heaven shall work in me for thine avail
 tell me truly
helena good madam pardon me
countess do you love my son
helena your pardon noble mistress
countess love you my son
helena do not you love him madam
countess go not about my love hath in't a bond
 whereof the world takes note come come disclose
 the state of your affection for your passions
 have to the full appeach'd
helena then i confess
 here on my knee before high heaven and you
 that before you and next unto high heaven
 i love your son
 my friends were poor but honest so's my love
 be not offended for it hurts not him
 that he is loved of me i follow him not
 by any token of presumptuous suit
 nor would i have him till i do deserve him
 yet never know how that desert should be
 i know i love in vain strive against hope
 yet in this captious and intenible sieve
 i still pour in the waters of my love
 and lack not to lose still thus indianlike
 religious in mine error i adore
 the sun that looks upon his worshipper
 but knows of him no more my dearest madam
 let not your hate encounter with my love
 for loving where you do but if yourself
 whose aged honour cites a virtuous youth
 did ever in so true a flame of liking
 wish chastely and love dearly that your dian
 was both herself and love o then give pity
 to her whose state is such that cannot choose
 but lend and give where she is sure to lose
 that seeks not to find that her search implies
 but riddlelike lives sweetly where she dies
countess had you not lately an intentspeak truly
 to go to paris
helena madam i had
countess wherefore tell true
helena i will tell truth by grace itself i swear
 you know my father left me some prescriptions
 of rare and proved effects such as his reading
 and manifest experience had collected
 for general sovereignty and that he will'd me
 in heedfull'st reservation to bestow them
 as notes whose faculties inclusive were
 more than they were in note amongst the rest
 there is a remedy approved set down
 to cure the desperate languishings whereof
 the king is render'd lost
countess this was your motive
 for paris was it speak
helena my lord your son made me to think of this
 else paris and the medicine and the king
 had from the conversation of my thoughts
 haply been absent then
countess but think you helen
 if you should tender your supposed aid
 he would receive it he and his physicians
 are of a mind he that they cannot help him
 they that they cannot help how shall they credit
 a poor unlearned virgin when the schools
 embowell'd of their doctrine have left off
 the danger to itself
helena there's something in't
 more than my father's skill which was the greatest
 of his profession that his good receipt
 shall for my legacy be sanctified
 by the luckiest stars in heaven and would your honour
 but give me leave to try success i'ld venture
 the welllost life of mine on his grace's cure
 by such a day and hour
countess dost thou believe't
helena ay madam knowingly
countess why helen thou shalt have my leave and love
 means and attendants and my loving greetings
 to those of mine in court i'll stay at home
 and pray god's blessing into thy attempt
 be gone tomorrow and be sure of this
 what i can help thee to thou shalt not miss
 exeunt
 all's well that ends well

 with divers young lords taking leave for the
 florentine war bertram and parolles

 do not throw from you and you my lords farewell

 will not confess he owes the malady
 that doth my life besiege farewell young lords

 of worthy frenchmen let higher italy

 the bravest questant shrinks find what you seek
 that fame may cry you loud i say farewell
second lord health at your bidding serve your majesty
king those girls of italy take heed of them
 they say our french lack language to deny
 if they demand beware of being captives
 before you serve
both our hearts receive your warnings
