 you have by fortune and his highness favours
 gone slightly o'er low steps and now are mounted
 where powers are your retainers and your words
 domestics to you serve your will as't please
 yourself pronounce their office i must tell you
 you tender more your person's honour than
 your high profession spiritual that again
 i do refuse you for my judge and here
 before you all appeal unto the pope
 to bring my whole cause fore his holiness
 and to be judged by him
 she curtsies to king henry viii and offers to depart
cardinal campeius the queen is obstinate
 stubborn to justice apt to accuse it and
 disdainful to be tried by't tis not well
 she's going away
king henry viii call her again
crier katharine queen of england come into the court
griffith madam you are call'd back
queen katharine what need you note it pray you keep your way
 when you are call'd return now the lord help
 they vex me past my patience pray you pass on
 i will not tarry no nor ever more
 upon this business my appearance make
 in any of their courts
 exeunt queen katharine and her attendants
king henry viii go thy ways kate
 that man i the world who shall report he has
 a better wife let him in nought be trusted
 for speaking false in that thou art alone
 if thy rare qualities sweet gentleness
 thy meekness saintlike wifelike government
 obeying in commanding and thy parts
 sovereign and pious else could speak thee out
 the queen of earthly queens she's noble born
 and like her true nobility she has
 carried herself towards me
cardinal wolsey most gracious sir
 in humblest manner i require your highness
 that it shall please you to declare in hearing
 of all these earsfor where i am robb'd and bound
 there must i be unloosed although not there
 at once and fully satisfiedwhether ever i
 did broach this business to your highness or
 laid any scruple in your way which might
 induce you to the question on't or ever
 have to you but with thanks to god for such
 a royal lady spake one the least word that might
 be to the prejudice of her present state
 or touch of her good person
king henry viii my lord cardinal
 i do excuse you yea upon mine honour
 i free you from't you are not to be taught
 that you have many enemies that know not
 why they are so but like to villagecurs
 bark when their fellows do by some of these
 the queen is put in anger you're excused
 but will you be more justified you ever
 have wish'd the sleeping of this business never desired
 it to be stirr'd but oft have hinder'd oft
 the passages made toward it on my honour
 i speak my good lord cardinal to this point
 and thus far clear him now what moved me to't
 i will be bold with time and your attention
 then mark the inducement thus it came give heed to't
 my conscience first received a tenderness
 scruple and prick on certain speeches utter'd
 by the bishop of bayonne then french ambassador
 who had been hither sent on the debating
 a marriage twixt the duke of orleans and
 our daughter mary i the progress of this business
 ere a determinate resolution he
 i mean the bishop did require a respite
 wherein he might the king his lord advertise
 whether our daughter were legitimate
 respecting this our marriage with the dowager
 sometimes our brother's wife this respite shook
 the bosom of my conscience enter'd me
 yea with a splitting power and made to tremble
 the region of my breast which forced such way
 that many mazed considerings did throng
 and press'd in with this caution first methought
 i stood not in the smile of heaven who had
 commanded nature that my lady's womb
 if it conceived a male child by me should
 do no more offices of life to't than
 the grave does to the dead for her male issue
 or died where they were made or shortly after
 this world had air'd them hence i took a thought
 this was a judgment on me that my kingdom
 well worthy the best heir o the world should not
 be gladded in't by me then follows that
 i weigh'd the danger which my realms stood in
 by this my issue's fail and that gave to me
 many a groaning throe thus hulling in
 the wild sea of my conscience i did steer
 toward this remedy whereupon we are
 now present here together that's to say
 i meant to rectify my consciencewhich
 i then did feel full sick and yet not well
 by all the reverend fathers of the land
 and doctors learn'd first i began in private
 with you my lord of lincoln you remember
 how under my oppression i did reek
 when i first moved you
lincoln very well my liege
king henry viii i have spoke long be pleased yourself to say
 how far you satisfied me
lincoln so please your highness
 the question did at first so stagger me
 bearing a state of mighty moment in't
 and consequence of dread that i committed
 the daring'st counsel which i had to doubt
 and did entreat your highness to this course
 which you are running here
king henry viii i then moved you
 my lord of canterbury and got your leave
 to make this present summons unsolicited
 i left no reverend person in this court
 but by particular consent proceeded
 under your hands and seals therefore go on
 for no dislike i the world against the person
 of the good queen but the sharp thorny points
 of my alleged reasons drive this forward
 prove but our marriage lawful by my life
 and kingly dignity we are contented
 to wear our mortal state to come with her
 katharine our queen before the primest creature
 that's paragon'd o the world
cardinal campeius so please your highness
 the queen being absent tis a needful fitness
 that we adjourn this court till further day
 meanwhile must be an earnest motion
 made to the queen to call back her appeal
 she intends unto his holiness
king henry viii aside i may perceive
 these cardinals trifle with me i abhor
 this dilatory sloth and tricks of rome
 my learn'd and wellbeloved servant cranmer
 prithee return with thy approach i know
 my comfort comes along break up the court
 i say set on
 exeunt in manner as they entered
 king henry viii
act iii
scene i london queen katharine's apartments
 enter queen katharine and her women as at work
queen katharine take thy lute wench my soul grows sad with troubles
 sing and disperse em if thou canst leave working
 song
 orpheus with his lute made trees
 and the mountain tops that freeze
 bow themselves when he did sing
 to his music plants and flowers
 ever sprung as sun and showers
 there had made a lasting spring
 every thing that heard him play
 even the billows of the sea
 hung their heads and then lay by
 in sweet music is such art
 killing care and grief of heart
 fall asleep or hearing die
 enter a gentleman
queen katharine how now
gentleman an't please your grace the two great cardinals
 wait in the presence
queen katharine would they speak with me
gentleman they will'd me say so madam
queen katharine pray their graces
 to come near
 exit gentleman
 what can be their business
 with me a poor weak woman fall'n from favour
 i do not like their coming now i think on't
 they should be good men their affairs as righteous
 but all hoods make not monks
 enter cardinal wolsey and cardinal campeius
cardinal wolsey peace to your highness
queen katharine your graces find me here part of a housewife
 i would be all against the worst may happen
 what are your pleasures with me reverend lords
cardinal wolsey may it please you noble madam to withdraw
 into your private chamber we shall give you
 the full cause of our coming
queen katharine speak it here
 there's nothing i have done yet o my conscience
 deserves a corner would all other women
 could speak this with as free a soul as i do
 my lords i care not so much i am happy
 above a number if my actions
 were tried by every tongue every eye saw em
 envy and base opinion set against em
 i know my life so even if your business
 seek me out and that way i am wife in
 out with it boldly truth loves open dealing
cardinal wolsey tanta est erga te mentis integritas regina
 serenissima
queen katharine o good my lord no latin
 i am not such a truant since my coming
 as not to know the language i have lived in
