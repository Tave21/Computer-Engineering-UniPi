 marcus we are but shrubs no cedars we
 no bigboned men framed of the cyclops size

 exeunt
 titus andronicus
act iv
scene iv the same before the palace
 enter saturninus tamora demetrius chiron
 lords and others saturninus with the arrows in
 his hand that titus shot
saturninus why lords what wrongs are these was ever seen
 an emperor in rome thus overborne
 troubled confronted thus and for the extent
 of egal justice used in such contempt
 my lords you know as know the mightful gods
 however these disturbers of our peace
 buz in the people's ears there nought hath pass'd
 but even with law against the willful sons
 of old andronicus and what an if
 his sorrows have so overwhelm'd his wits
 shall we be thus afflicted in his wreaks
 his fits his frenzy and his bitterness
 and now he writes to heaven for his redress
 see here's to jove and this to mercury
 this to apollo this to the god of war
 sweet scrolls to fly about the streets of rome
 what's this but libelling against the senate
 and blazoning our injustice every where
 a goodly humour is it not my lords
 as who would say in rome no justice were
 but if i live his feigned ecstasies
 shall be no shelter to these outrages
 but he and his shall know that justice lives
 in saturninus health whom if she sleep
 he'll so awake as she in fury shall
 cut off the proud'st conspirator that lives
tamora my gracious lord my lovely saturnine
 lord of my life commander of my thoughts
 calm thee and bear the faults of titus age
 the effects of sorrow for his valiant sons
 whose loss hath pierced him deep and scarr'd his heart
 and rather comfort his distressed plight
 than prosecute the meanest or the best
 for these contempts
 aside
 why thus it shall become
 highwitted tamora to gloze with all
 but titus i have touched thee to the quick
 thy lifeblood out if aaron now be wise
 then is all safe the anchor's in the port
 enter clown
 how now good fellow wouldst thou speak with us
clown yea forsooth an your mistership be emperial
tamora empress i am but yonder sits the emperor
clown tis he god and saint stephen give you good den
 i have brought you a letter and a couple of pigeons here
 saturninus reads the letter
saturninus go take him away and hang him presently
clown how much money must i have
tamora come sirrah you must be hanged
clown hanged by'r lady then i have brought up a neck to
 a fair end
 exit guarded
saturninus despiteful and intolerable wrongs
 shall i endure this monstrous villany
 i know from whence this same device proceeds
 may this be borneas if his traitorous sons
 that died by law for murder of our brother
 have by my means been butcher'd wrongfully
 go drag the villain hither by the hair
 nor age nor honour shall shape privilege
 for this proud mock i'll be thy slaughterman
 sly frantic wretch that holp'st to make me great
 in hope thyself should govern rome and me
 enter aemilius
 what news with thee aemilius
aemilius arm arm my lordrome never had more cause
 the goths have gather'd head and with a power
 highresolved men bent to the spoil
 they hither march amain under conduct
 of lucius son to old andronicus
 who threats in course of this revenge to do
 as much as ever coriolanus did
saturninus is warlike lucius general of the goths
 these tidings nip me and i hang the head
 as flowers with frost or grass beat down with storms
 ay now begin our sorrows to approach
 tis he the common people love so much
 myself hath often overheard them say
 when i have walked like a private man
 that lucius banishment was wrongfully
 and they have wish'd that lucius were their emperor
tamora why should you fear is not your city strong
saturninus ay but the citizens favor lucius
 and will revolt from me to succor him
tamora king be thy thoughts imperious like thy name
 is the sun dimm'd that gnats do fly in it
 the eagle suffers little birds to sing
 and is not careful what they mean thereby
 knowing that with the shadow of his wings
 he can at pleasure stint their melody
 even so mayst thou the giddy men of rome
 then cheer thy spirit for know thou emperor
 i will enchant the old andronicus
 with words more sweet and yet more dangerous
 than baits to fish or honeystalks to sheep
 when as the one is wounded with the bait
 the other rotted with delicious feed
saturninus but he will not entreat his son for us
tamora if tamora entreat him then he will
 for i can smooth and fill his aged ear
 with golden promises that were his heart
 almost impregnable his old ears deaf
 yet should both ear and heart obey my tongue
 to aemilius
 go thou before be our ambassador
 say that the emperor requests a parley
 of warlike lucius and appoint the meeting
 even at his father's house the old andronicus
saturninus aemilius do this message honourably
 and if he stand on hostage for his safety
 bid him demand what pledge will please him best
aemilius your bidding shall i do effectually
