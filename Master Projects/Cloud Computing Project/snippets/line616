 before day an the prince and poins be not two
 arrant cowards there's no equity stirring there's
 no more valour in that poins than in a wildduck

 as they are sharing the prince and poins set upon
 them they all run away and falstaff after a blow
 or two runs away too leaving the booty behind them
prince henry got with much ease now merrily to horse
 the thieves are all scatter'd and possess'd with fear
 so strongly that they dare not meet each other
 each takes his fellow for an officer

 and lards the lean earth as he walks along

 how now kate i must leave you within these two hours
lady percy o my good lord why are you thus alone
 for what offence have i this fortnight been
 a banish'd woman from my harry's bed
 tell me sweet lord what is't that takes from thee
 thy stomach pleasure and thy golden sleep
 why dost thou bend thine eyes upon the earth
 and start so often when thou sit'st alone
 why hast thou lost the fresh blood in thy cheeks
 and given my treasures and my rights of thee
 to thickeyed musing and cursed melancholy
 in thy faint slumbers i by thee have watch'd
 and heard thee murmur tales of iron wars
 speak terms of manage to thy bounding steed
 cry courage to the field and thou hast talk'd
 of sallies and retires of trenches tents
 of palisadoes frontiers parapets
 of basilisks of cannon culverin
 of prisoners ransom and of soldiers slain
 and all the currents of a heady fight
 thy spirit within thee hath been so at war
 and thus hath so bestirr'd thee in thy sleep
 that beads of sweat have stood upon thy brow
 like bubbles in a latedisturbed stream
 and in thy face strange motions have appear'd
 such as we see when men restrain their breath
 on some great sudden hest o what portents are these
 some heavy business hath my lord in hand
 and i must know it else he loves me not
hotspur what ho

 much honour that thou wert not with me in this sweet
 action but sweet nedto sweeten which name of

 of bastard in the halfmoon or so but ned to
 drive away the time till falstaff come i prithee
