 thou shalt be punish'd for thus frighting me
 for i am sick and capable of fears
 oppress'd with wrongs and therefore full of fears
 a widow husbandless subject to fears
 a woman naturally born to fears
 and though thou now confess thou didst but jest
 with my vex'd spirits i cannot take a truce
 but they will quake and tremble all this day
 what dost thou mean by shaking of thy head
 why dost thou look so sadly on my son
 what means that hand upon that breast of thine
 why holds thine eye that lamentable rheum
 like a proud river peering o'er his bounds
 be these sad signs confirmers of thy words
 then speak again not all thy former tale
 but this one word whether thy tale be true
salisbury as true as i believe you think them false
 that give you cause to prove my saying true
constance o if thou teach me to believe this sorrow
 teach thou this sorrow how to make me die
 and let belief and life encounter so
 as doth the fury of two desperate men
 which in the very meeting fall and die
 lewis marry blanch o boy then where art thou
 france friend with england what becomes of me
 fellow be gone i cannot brook thy sight
 this news hath made thee a most ugly man
salisbury what other harm have i good lady done
 but spoke the harm that is by others done
constance which harm within itself so heinous is
 as it makes harmful all that speak of it
arthur i do beseech you madam be content
constance if thou that bid'st me be content wert grim
 ugly and slanderous to thy mother's womb
 full of unpleasing blots and sightless stains
 lame foolish crooked swart prodigious
 patch'd with foul moles and eyeoffending marks
 i would not care i then would be content
 for then i should not love thee no nor thou
 become thy great birth nor deserve a crown
 but thou art fair and at thy birth dear boy
 nature and fortune join'd to make thee great
 of nature's gifts thou mayst with lilies boast
 and with the halfblown rose but fortune o
 she is corrupted changed and won from thee
 she adulterates hourly with thine uncle john
 and with her golden hand hath pluck'd on france
 to tread down fair respect of sovereignty
 and made his majesty the bawd to theirs
 france is a bawd to fortune and king john
 that strumpet fortune that usurping john
 tell me thou fellow is not france forsworn
 envenom him with words or get thee gone
 and leave those woes alone which i alone
 am bound to underbear
salisbury pardon me madam
 i may not go without you to the kings
constance thou mayst thou shalt i will not go with thee
 i will instruct my sorrows to be proud
 for grief is proud and makes his owner stoop
 to me and to the state of my great grief
 let kings assemble for my grief's so great
 that no supporter but the huge firm earth
 can hold it up here i and sorrows sit
 here is my throne bid kings come bow to it
 seats herself on the ground
 enter king john king phillip lewis blanch
 queen elinor the bastard austria and attendants
king philip tis true fair daughter and this blessed day
 ever in france shall be kept festival
 to solemnize this day the glorious sun
 stays in his course and plays the alchemist
 turning with splendor of his precious eye
 the meagre cloddy earth to glittering gold
 the yearly course that brings this day about
 shall never see it but a holiday
constance a wicked day and not a holy day
 rising
 what hath this day deserved what hath it done
 that it in golden letters should be set
 among the high tides in the calendar
 nay rather turn this day out of the week
 this day of shame oppression perjury
 or if it must stand still let wives with child
 pray that their burthens may not fall this day
 lest that their hopes prodigiously be cross'd
 but on this day let seamen fear no wreck
 no bargains break that are not this day made
 this day all things begun come to ill end
 yea faith itself to hollow falsehood change
king philip by heaven lady you shall have no cause
 to curse the fair proceedings of this day
 have i not pawn'd to you my majesty
constance you have beguiled me with a counterfeit
 resembling majesty which being touch'd and tried
 proves valueless you are forsworn forsworn
 you came in arms to spill mine enemies blood
 but now in arms you strengthen it with yours
 the grappling vigour and rough frown of war
 is cold in amity and painted peace
 and our oppression hath made up this league
 arm arm you heavens against these perjured kings
 a widow cries be husband to me heavens
 let not the hours of this ungodly day
 wear out the day in peace but ere sunset
 set armed discord twixt these perjured kings
 hear me o hear me
austria lady constance peace
constance war war no peace peace is to me a war
 o lymoges o austria thou dost shame
 that bloody spoil thou slave thou wretch thou coward
 thou little valiant great in villany
 thou ever strong upon the stronger side
 thou fortune's champion that dost never fight
 but when her humorous ladyship is by
 to teach thee safety thou art perjured too
 and soothest up greatness what a fool art thou
 a ramping fool to brag and stamp and swear
 upon my party thou coldblooded slave
 hast thou not spoke like thunder on my side
 been sworn my soldier bidding me depend
 upon thy stars thy fortune and thy strength
 and dost thou now fall over to my fores
 thou wear a lion's hide doff it for shame
 and hang a calf'sskin on those recreant limbs
austria o that a man should speak those words to me
bastard and hang a calf'sskin on those recreant limbs
austria thou darest not say so villain for thy life
bastard and hang a calf'sskin on those recreant limbs
king john we like not this thou dost forget thyself
 enter cardinal pandulph
king philip here comes the holy legate of the pope
cardinal pandulph hail you anointed deputies of heaven
 to thee king john my holy errand is
 i pandulph of fair milan cardinal
 and from pope innocent the legate here
 do in his name religiously demand
 why thou against the church our holy mother
 so wilfully dost spurn and force perforce
 keep stephen langton chosen archbishop
 of canterbury from that holy see
 this in our foresaid holy father's name
 pope innocent i do demand of thee
king john what earthy name to interrogatories
 can task the free breath of a sacred king
 thou canst not cardinal devise a name
 so slight unworthy and ridiculous
 to charge me to an answer as the pope
 tell him this tale and from the mouth of england
 add thus much more that no italian priest
 shall tithe or toll in our dominions
 but as we under heaven are supreme head
 so under him that great supremacy
 where we do reign we will alone uphold
 without the assistance of a mortal hand
 so tell the pope all reverence set apart
 to him and his usurp'd authority
king philip brother of england you blaspheme in this
king john though you and all the kings of christendom
 are led so grossly by this meddling priest
 dreading the curse that money may buy out
 and by the merit of vile gold dross dust
 purchase corrupted pardon of a man
 who in that sale sells pardon from himself
 though you and all the rest so grossly led
 this juggling witchcraft with revenue cherish
 yet i alone alone do me oppose
 against the pope and count his friends my foes
cardinal pandulph then by the lawful power that i have
 thou shalt stand cursed and excommunicate
 and blessed shall he be that doth revolt
 from his allegiance to an heretic
 and meritorious shall that hand be call'd
 canonized and worshipped as a saint
 that takes away by any secret course
 thy hateful life
constance o lawful let it be
 that i have room with rome to curse awhile
 good father cardinal cry thou amen
 to my keen curses for without my wrong
 there is no tongue hath power to curse him right
cardinal pandulph there's law and warrant lady for my curse
constance and for mine too when law can do no right
 let it be lawful that law bar no wrong
 law cannot give my child his kingdom here
 for he that holds his kingdom holds the law
 therefore since law itself is perfect wrong
 how can the law forbid my tongue to curse
cardinal pandulph philip of france on peril of a curse
 let go the hand of that archheretic
 and raise the power of france upon his head
 unless he do submit himself to rome
queen elinor look'st thou pale france do not let go thy hand
constance look to that devil lest that france repent
 and by disjoining hands hell lose a soul
austria king philip listen to the cardinal
bastard and hang a calf'sskin on his recreant limbs
austria well ruffian i must pocket up these wrongs because
bastard your breeches best may carry them
king john philip what say'st thou to the cardinal
