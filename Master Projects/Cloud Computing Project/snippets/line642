 exit from the walls
suffolk and here i will expect thy coming
 trumpets sound enter reignier below
reignier welcome brave earl into our territories
 command in anjou what your honour pleases
suffolk thanks reignier happy for so sweet a child
 fit to be made companion with a king
 what answer makes your grace unto my suit
reignier since thou dost deign to woo her little worth
 to be the princely bride of such a lord
 upon condition i may quietly
 enjoy mine own the country maine and anjou
 free from oppression or the stroke of war
 my daughter shall be henry's if he please
suffolk that is her ransom i deliver her
 and those two counties i will undertake
 your grace shall well and quietly enjoy
reignier and i again in henry's royal name
 as deputy unto that gracious king
 give thee her hand for sign of plighted faith
suffolk reignier of france i give thee kingly thanks
 because this is in traffic of a king
 aside
 and yet methinks i could be well content
 to be mine own attorney in this case
 i'll over then to england with this news
 and make this marriage to be solemnized
 so farewell reignier set this diamond safe
 in golden palaces as it becomes
reignier i do embrace thee as i would embrace
 the christian prince king henry were he here
margaret farewell my lord good wishes praise and prayers
 shall suffolk ever have of margaret
 going
suffolk farewell sweet madam but hark you margaret
 no princely commendations to my king
margaret such commendations as becomes a maid
 a virgin and his servant say to him
suffolk words sweetly placed and modestly directed
 but madam i must trouble you again
 no loving token to his majesty
margaret yes my good lord a pure unspotted heart
 never yet taint with love i send the king
suffolk and this withal
 kisses her
margaret that for thyself i will not so presume
 to send such peevish tokens to a king
 exeunt reignier and margaret
suffolk o wert thou for myself but suffolk stay
 thou mayst not wander in that labyrinth
 there minotaurs and ugly treasons lurk
 solicit henry with her wondrous praise
 bethink thee on her virtues that surmount
 and natural graces that extinguish art
 repeat their semblance often on the seas
 that when thou comest to kneel at henry's feet
 thou mayst bereave him of his wits with wonder

act v
scene iv camp of the york in anjou
 enter york warwick and others
york bring forth that sorceress condemn'd to burn
 enter joan la pucelle guarded and a shepherd
shepherd ah joan this kills thy father's heart outright
 have i sought every country far and near
 and now it is my chance to find thee out
 must i behold thy timeless cruel death
 ah joan sweet daughter joan i'll die with thee
joan la pucelle decrepit miser base ignoble wretch
 i am descended of a gentler blood
 thou art no father nor no friend of mine
shepherd out out my lords an please you tis not so
 i did beget her all the parish knows
 her mother liveth yet can testify
 she was the first fruit of my bachelorship
warwick graceless wilt thou deny thy parentage
york this argues what her kind of life hath been
 wicked and vile and so her death concludes
shepherd fie joan that thou wilt be so obstacle
 god knows thou art a collop of my flesh
 and for thy sake have i shed many a tear
 deny me not i prithee gentle joan
joan la pucelle peasant avaunt you have suborn'd this man
 of purpose to obscure my noble birth
shepherd tis true i gave a noble to the priest
 the morn that i was wedded to her mother
 kneel down and take my blessing good my girl
 wilt thou not stoop now cursed be the time
 of thy nativity i would the milk
 thy mother gave thee when thou suck'dst her breast
 had been a little ratsbane for thy sake
 or else when thou didst keep my lambs afield
 i wish some ravenous wolf had eaten thee
 dost thou deny thy father cursed drab
 o burn her burn her hanging is too good
 exit
york take her away for she hath lived too long
 to fill the world with vicious qualities
joan la pucelle first let me tell you whom you have condemn'd
 not me begotten of a shepherd swain
 but issued from the progeny of kings
 virtuous and holy chosen from above
 by inspiration of celestial grace
 to work exceeding miracles on earth
 i never had to do with wicked spirits
 but you that are polluted with your lusts
 stain'd with the guiltless blood of innocents
 corrupt and tainted with a thousand vices
 because you want the grace that others have
 you judge it straight a thing impossible
 to compass wonders but by help of devils
 no misconceived joan of arc hath been
 a virgin from her tender infancy
 chaste and immaculate in very thought
 whose maiden blood thus rigorously effused
 will cry for vengeance at the gates of heaven
york ay ay away with her to execution
warwick and hark ye sirs because she is a maid
 spare for no faggots let there be enow
 place barrels of pitch upon the fatal stake
 that so her torture may be shortened
joan la pucelle will nothing turn your unrelenting hearts
 then joan discover thine infirmity
 that warranteth by law to be thy privilege
 i am with child ye bloody homicides
 murder not then the fruit within my womb
 although ye hale me to a violent death
york now heaven forfend the holy maid with child
warwick the greatest miracle that e'er ye wrought
 is all your strict preciseness come to this
york she and the dauphin have been juggling
 i did imagine what would be her refuge
warwick well go to we'll have no bastards live
 especially since charles must father it
joan la pucelle you are deceived my child is none of his
 it was alencon that enjoy'd my love
york alencon that notorious machiavel
 it dies an if it had a thousand lives
joan la pucelle o give me leave i have deluded you
 twas neither charles nor yet the duke i named
 but reignier king of naples that prevail'd
warwick a married man that's most intolerable
york why here's a girl i think she knows not well
 there were so many whom she may accuse
warwick it's sign she hath been liberal and free
york and yet forsooth she is a virgin pure
 strumpet thy words condemn thy brat and thee
 use no entreaty for it is in vain
joan la pucelle then lead me hence with whom i leave my curse
 may never glorious sun reflex his beams
 upon the country where you make abode
 but darkness and the gloomy shade of death
 environ you till mischief and despair
 drive you to break your necks or hang yourselves
 exit guarded
york break thou in pieces and consume to ashes
 thou foul accursed minister of hell
 enter cardinal of winchester attended
cardinal
of winchester lord regent i do greet your excellence
 with letters of commission from the king
 for know my lords the states of christendom
 moved with remorse of these outrageous broils
 have earnestly implored a general peace
 betwixt our nation and the aspiring french
 and here at hand the dauphin and his train
 approacheth to confer about some matter
york is all our travail turn'd to this effect
 after the slaughter of so many peers
 so many captains gentlemen and soldiers
 that in this quarrel have been overthrown
 and sold their bodies for their country's benefit
 shall we at last conclude effeminate peace
 have we not lost most part of all the towns
 by treason falsehood and by treachery
 our great progenitors had conquered
 o warwick warwick i foresee with grief
 the utter loss of all the realm of france
warwick be patient york if we conclude a peace
 it shall be with such strict and severe covenants
 as little shall the frenchmen gain thereby
 enter charles alencon bastard of orleans
 reignier and others
charles since lords of england it is thus agreed
 that peaceful truce shall be proclaim'd in france
 we come to be informed by yourselves
 what the conditions of that league must be
york speak winchester for boiling choler chokes
 the hollow passage of my poison'd voice
 by sight of these our baleful enemies
cardinal
of winchester charles and the rest it is enacted thus
 that in regard king henry gives consent
 of mere compassion and of lenity
 to ease your country of distressful war
 and suffer you to breathe in fruitful peace
 you shall become true liegemen to his crown
 and charles upon condition thou wilt swear
 to pay him tribute submit thyself
