and about the eleventh hour he went out and found others standing idle and saith unto them why stand ye here all the day idle
they say unto him because no man hath hired us he saith unto them go ye also into the vineyard and whatsoever is right that shall ye receive
so when even was come the lord of the vineyard saith unto his steward call the labourers and give them their hire beginning from the last unto the first
and when they came that were hired about the eleventh hour they received every man a penny
but when the first came they supposed that they should have received more and they likewise received every man a penny
and when they had received it they murmured against the goodman of the house
saying these last have wrought but one hour and thou hast made them equal unto us which have borne the burden and heat of the day
but he answered one of them and said friend i do thee no wrong didst not thou agree with me for a penny
take that thine is and go thy way i will give unto this last even as unto thee
is it not lawful for me to do what i will with mine own is thine eye evil because i am good
so the last shall be first and the first last for many be called but few chosen
and jesus going up to jerusalem took the twelve disciples apart in the way and said unto them
behold we go up to jerusalem and the son of man shall be betrayed unto the chief priests and unto the scribes and they shall condemn him to death
and shall deliver him to the gentiles to mock and to scourge and to crucify him and the third day he shall rise again
then came to him the mother of zebedee's children with her sons worshipping him and desiring a certain thing of him
and he said unto her what wilt thou she saith unto him grant that these my two sons may sit the one on thy right hand and the other on the left in thy kingdom
but jesus answered and said ye know not what ye ask are ye able to drink of the cup that i shall drink of and to be baptized with the baptism that i am baptized with they say unto him we are able
and he saith unto them ye shall drink indeed of my cup and be baptized with the baptism that i am baptized with but to sit on my right hand and on my left is not mine to give but it shall be given to them for whom it is prepared of my father
and when the ten heard it they were moved with indignation against the two brethren
but jesus called them unto him and said ye know that the princes of the gentiles exercise dominion over them and they that are great exercise authority upon them
but it shall not be so among you but whosoever will be great among you let him be your minister
and whosoever will be chief among you let him be your servant
even as the son of man came not to be ministered unto but to minister and to give his life a ransom for many
and as they departed from jericho a great multitude followed him
and behold two blind men sitting by the way side when they heard that jesus passed by cried out saying have mercy on us o lord thou son of david
and the multitude rebuked them because they should hold their peace but they cried the more saying have mercy on us o lord thou son of david
and jesus stood still and called them and said what will ye that i shall do unto you
they say unto him lord that our eyes may be opened
so jesus had compassion on them and touched their eyes and immediately their eyes received sight and they followed him
and when they drew nigh unto jerusalem and were come to bethphage unto the mount of olives then sent jesus two disciples
saying unto them go into the village over against you and straightway ye shall find an ass tied and a colt with her loose them and bring them unto me
and if any man say ought unto you ye shall say the lord hath need of them and straightway he will send them
all this was done that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet saying
tell ye the daughter of sion behold thy king cometh unto thee meek and sitting upon an ass and a colt the foal of an ass
and the disciples went and did as jesus commanded them
and brought the ass and the colt and put on them their clothes and they set him thereon
and a very great multitude spread their garments in the way others cut down branches from the trees and strawed them in the way
and the multitudes that went before and that followed cried saying hosanna to the son of david blessed is he that cometh in the name of the lord hosanna in the highest
and when he was come into jerusalem all the city was moved saying who is this
and the multitude said this is jesus the prophet of nazareth of galilee
and jesus went into the temple of god and cast out all them that sold and bought in the temple and overthrew the tables of the moneychangers and the seats of them that sold doves
and said unto them it is written my house shall be called the house of prayer but ye have made it a den of thieves
and the blind and the lame came to him in the temple and he healed them
and when the chief priests and scribes saw the wonderful things that he did and the children crying in the temple and saying hosanna to the son of david they were sore displeased
and said unto him hearest thou what these say and jesus saith unto them yea have ye never read out of the mouth of babes and sucklings thou hast perfected praise
and he left them and went out of the city into bethany and he lodged there
now in the morning as he returned into the city he hungered
and when he saw a fig tree in the way he came to it and found nothing thereon but leaves only and said unto it let no fruit grow on thee henceforward for ever and presently the fig tree withered away
and when the disciples saw it they marvelled saying how soon is the fig tree withered away
jesus answered and said unto them verily i say unto you if ye have faith and doubt not ye shall not only do this which is done to the fig tree but also if ye shall say unto this mountain be thou removed and be thou cast into the sea it shall be done
and all things whatsoever ye shall ask in prayer believing ye shall receive
and when he was come into the temple the chief priests and the elders of the people came unto him as he was teaching and said by what authority doest thou these things and who gave thee this authority
and jesus answered and said unto them i also will ask you one thing which if ye tell me i in like wise will tell you by what authority i do these things
the baptism of john whence was it from heaven or of men and they reasoned with themselves saying if we shall say from heaven he will say unto us why did ye not then believe him
but if we shall say of men we fear the people for all hold john as a prophet
and they answered jesus and said we cannot tell and he said unto them neither tell i you by what authority i do these things
but what think ye a certain man had two sons and he came to the first and said son go work to day in my vineyard
he answered and said i will not but afterward he repented and went
and he came to the second and said likewise and he answered and said i go sir and went not
whether of them twain did the will of his father they say unto him the first jesus saith unto them verily i say unto you that the publicans and the harlots go into the kingdom of god before you
for john came unto you in the way of righteousness and ye believed him not but the publicans and the harlots believed him and ye when ye had seen it repented not afterward that ye might believe him
hear another parable there was a certain householder which planted a vineyard and hedged it round about and digged a winepress in it and built a tower and let it out to husbandmen and went into a far country
and when the time of the fruit drew near he sent his servants to the husbandmen that they might receive the fruits of it
and the husbandmen took his servants and beat one and killed another and stoned another
again he sent other servants more than the first and they did unto them likewise
but last of all he sent unto them his son saying they will reverence my son
but when the husbandmen saw the son they said among themselves this is the heir come let us kill him and let us seize on his inheritance
and they caught him and cast him out of the vineyard and slew him
when the lord therefore of the vineyard cometh what will he do unto those husbandmen
they say unto him he will miserably destroy those wicked men and will let out his vineyard unto other husbandmen which shall render him the fruits in their seasons
jesus saith unto them did ye never read in the scriptures the stone which the builders rejected the same is become the head of the corner this is the lord's doing and it is marvellous in our eyes
therefore say i unto you the kingdom of god shall be taken from you and given to a nation bringing forth the fruits thereof
and whosoever shall fall on this stone shall be broken but on whomsoever it shall fall it will grind him to powder
and when the chief priests and pharisees had heard his parables they perceived that he spake of them
but when they sought to lay hands on him they feared the multitude because they took him for a prophet
and jesus answered and spake unto them again by parables and said
the kingdom of heaven is like unto a certain king which made a marriage for his son
and sent forth his servants to call them that were bidden to the wedding and they would not come
again he sent forth other servants saying tell them which are bidden behold i have prepared my dinner my oxen and my fatlings are killed and all things are ready come unto the marriage
but they made light of it and went their ways one to his farm another to his merchandise
and the remnant took his servants and entreated them spitefully and slew them
but when the king heard thereof he was wroth and he sent forth his armies and destroyed those murderers and burned up their city
then saith he to his servants the wedding is ready but they which were bidden were not worthy
go ye therefore into the highways and as many as ye shall find bid to the marriage
so those servants went out into the highways and gathered together all as many as they found both bad and good and the wedding was furnished with guests
and when the king came in to see the guests he saw there a man which had not on a wedding garment
and he saith unto him friend how camest thou in hither not having a wedding garment and he was speechless
then said the king to the servants bind him hand and foot and take him away and cast him into outer darkness there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth
for many are called but few are chosen
then went the pharisees and took counsel how they might entangle him in his talk
and they sent out unto him their disciples with the herodians saying master we know that thou art true and teachest the way of god in truth neither carest thou for any man for thou regardest not the person of men
tell us therefore what thinkest thou is it lawful to give tribute unto caesar or not
but jesus perceived their wickedness and said why tempt ye me ye hypocrites
shew me the tribute money and they brought unto him a penny
and he saith unto them whose is this image and superscription
they say unto him caesar's then saith he unto them render therefore unto caesar the things which are caesar's and unto god the things that are god's
when they had heard these words they marvelled and left him and went their way
the same day came to him the sadducees which say that there is no resurrection and asked him
saying master moses said if a man die having no children his brother shall marry his wife and raise up seed unto his brother
now there were with us seven brethren and the first when he had married a wife deceased and having no issue left his wife unto his brother
likewise the second also and the third unto the seventh
and last of all the woman died also
therefore in the resurrection whose wife shall she be of the seven for they all had her
jesus answered and said unto them ye do err not knowing the scriptures nor the power of god
for in the resurrection they neither marry nor are given in marriage but are as the angels of god in heaven
but as touching the resurrection of the dead have ye not read that which was spoken unto you by god saying
i am the god of abraham and the god of isaac and the god of jacob god is not the god of the dead but of the living
and when the multitude heard this they were astonished at his doctrine
but when the pharisees had heard that he had put the sadducees to silence they were gathered together
then one of them which was a lawyer asked him a question tempting him and saying
master which is the great commandment in the law
jesus said unto him thou shalt love the lord thy god with all thy heart and with all thy soul and with all thy mind
this is the first and great commandment
and the second is like unto it thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself
on these two commandments hang all the law and the prophets
while the pharisees were gathered together jesus asked them
saying what think ye of christ whose son is he they say unto him the son of david
he saith unto them how then doth david in spirit call him lord saying
the lord said unto my lord sit thou on my right hand till i make thine enemies thy footstool
if david then call him lord how is he his son
and no man was able to answer him a word neither durst any man from that day forth ask him any more questions
then spake jesus to the multitude and to his disciples
saying the scribes and the pharisees sit in moses seat
all therefore whatsoever they bid you observe that observe and do but do not ye after their works for they say and do not
for they bind heavy burdens and grievous to be borne and lay them on men's shoulders but they themselves will not move them with one of their fingers
but all their works they do for to be seen of men they make broad their phylacteries and enlarge the borders of their garments
and love the uppermost rooms at feasts and the chief seats in the synagogues
and greetings in the markets and to be called of men rabbi rabbi
but be not ye called rabbi for one is your master even christ and all ye are brethren
and call no man your father upon the earth for one is your father which is in heaven
neither be ye called masters for one is your master even christ
but he that is greatest among you shall be your servant
and whosoever shall exalt himself shall be abased and he that shall humble himself shall be exalted
but woe unto you scribes and pharisees hypocrites for ye shut up the kingdom of heaven against men for ye neither go in yourselves neither suffer ye them that are entering to go in
woe unto you scribes and pharisees hypocrites for ye devour widows houses and for a pretence make long prayer therefore ye shall receive the greater damnation
woe unto you scribes and pharisees hypocrites for ye compass sea and land to make one proselyte and when he is made ye make him twofold more the child of hell than yourselves
woe unto you ye blind guides which say whosoever shall swear by the temple it is nothing but whosoever shall swear by the gold of the temple he is a debtor
ye fools and blind for whether is greater the gold or the temple that sanctifieth the gold
and whosoever shall swear by the altar it is nothing but whosoever sweareth by the gift that is upon it he is guilty
ye fools and blind for whether is greater the gift or the altar that sanctifieth the gift
whoso therefore shall swear by the altar sweareth by it and by all things thereon
and whoso shall swear by the temple sweareth by it and by him that dwelleth therein
and he that shall swear by heaven sweareth by the throne of god and by him that sitteth thereon
woe unto you scribes and pharisees hypocrites for ye pay tithe of mint and anise and cummin and have omitted the weightier matters of the law judgment mercy and faith these ought ye to have done and not to leave the other undone
ye blind guides which strain at a gnat and swallow a camel
woe unto you scribes and pharisees hypocrites for ye make clean the outside of the cup and of the platter but within they are full of extortion and excess
thou blind pharisee cleanse first that which is within the cup and platter that the outside of them may be clean also
woe unto you scribes and pharisees hypocrites for ye are like unto whited sepulchres which indeed appear beautiful outward but are within full of dead men's bones and of all uncleanness
even so ye also outwardly appear righteous unto men but within ye are full of hypocrisy and iniquity
woe unto you scribes and pharisees hypocrites because ye build the tombs of the prophets and garnish the sepulchres of the righteous
and say if we had been in the days of our fathers we would not have been partakers with them in the blood of the prophets
wherefore ye be witnesses unto yourselves that ye are the children of them which killed the prophets
fill ye up then the measure of your fathers
ye serpents ye generation of vipers how can ye escape the damnation of hell
wherefore behold i send unto you prophets and wise men and scribes and some of them ye shall kill and crucify and some of them shall ye scourge in your synagogues and persecute them from city to city
that upon you may come all the righteous blood shed upon the earth from the blood of righteous abel unto the blood of zacharias son of barachias whom ye slew between the temple and the altar
verily i say unto you all these things shall come upon this generation
o jerusalem jerusalem thou that killest the prophets and stonest them which are sent unto thee how often would i have gathered thy children together even as a hen gathereth her chickens under her wings and ye would not
behold your house is left unto you desolate
for i say unto you ye shall not see me henceforth till ye shall say blessed is he that cometh in the name of the lord
and jesus went out and departed from the temple and his disciples came to him for to shew him the buildings of the temple
and jesus said unto them see ye not all these things verily i say unto you there shall not be left here one stone upon another that shall not be thrown down
and as he sat upon the mount of olives the disciples came unto him privately saying tell us when shall these things be and what shall be the sign of thy coming and of the end of the world
and jesus answered and said unto them take heed that no man deceive you
for many shall come in my name saying i am christ and shall deceive many
and ye shall hear of wars and rumours of wars see that ye be not troubled for all these things must come to pass but the end is not yet
for nation shall rise against nation and kingdom against kingdom and there shall be famines and pestilences and earthquakes in divers places
all these are the beginning of sorrows
then shall they deliver you up to be afflicted and shall kill you and ye shall be hated of all nations for my name's sake
and then shall many be offended and shall betray one another and shall hate one another
and many false prophets shall rise and shall deceive many
and because iniquity shall abound the love of many shall wax cold
but he that shall endure unto the end the same shall be saved
and this gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all the world for a witness unto all nations and then shall the end come
when ye therefore shall see the abomination of desolation spoken of by daniel the prophet stand in the holy place whoso readeth let him understand
then let them which be in judaea flee into the mountains
let him which is on the housetop not come down to take any thing out of his house
neither let him which is in the field return back to take his clothes
and woe unto them that are with child and to them that give suck in those days
but pray ye that your flight be not in the winter neither on the sabbath day
for then shall be great tribulation such as was not since the beginning of the world to this time no nor ever shall be
and except those days should be shortened there should no flesh be saved but for the elect's sake those days shall be shortened
then if any man shall say unto you lo here is christ or there believe it not
for there shall arise false christs and false prophets and shall shew great signs and wonders insomuch that if it were possible they shall deceive the very elect
behold i have told you before
wherefore if they shall say unto you behold he is in the desert go not forth behold he is in the secret chambers believe it not
for as the lightning cometh out of the east and shineth even unto the west so shall also the coming of the son of man be
for wheresoever the carcase is there will the eagles be gathered together
immediately after the tribulation of those days shall the sun be darkened and the moon shall not give her light and the stars shall fall from heaven and the powers of the heavens shall be shaken
and then shall appear the sign of the son of man in heaven and then shall all the tribes of the earth mourn and they shall see the son of man coming in the clouds of heaven with power and great glory
and he shall send his angels with a great sound of a trumpet and they shall gather together his elect from the four winds from one end of heaven to the other
now learn a parable of the fig tree when his branch is yet tender and putteth forth leaves ye know that summer is nigh
so likewise ye when ye shall see all these things know that it is near even at the doors
verily i say unto you this generation shall not pass till all these things be fulfilled
heaven and earth shall pass away but my words shall not pass away
but of that day and hour knoweth no man no not the angels of heaven but my father only
but as the days of noe were so shall also the coming of the son of man be
for as in the days that were before the flood they were eating and drinking marrying and giving in marriage until the day that noe entered into the ark
and knew not until the flood came and took them all away so shall also the coming of the son of man be
then shall two be in the field the one shall be taken and the other left
