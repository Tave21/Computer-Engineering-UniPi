that dazzleth them or else some shame supposed
but blind they are and keep themselves enclosed
o had they in that darksome prison died
then had they seen the period of their ill
then collatine again by lucrece side
in his clear bed might have reposed still
but they must ope this blessed league to kill
and holythoughted lucrece to their sight
must sell her joy her life her world's delight
her lily hand her rosy cheek lies under
cozening the pillow of a lawful kiss
who therefore angry seems to part in sunder
swelling on either side to want his bliss
between whose hills her head entombed is
where like a virtuous monument she lies
to be admired of lewd unhallow'd eyes
without the bed her other fair hand was
on the green coverlet whose perfect white
show'd like an april daisy on the grass
with pearly sweat resembling dew of night
her eyes like marigolds had sheathed their light
and canopied in darkness sweetly lay
till they might open to adorn the day
her hair like golden threads play'd with her breath
o modest wantons wanton modesty
showing life's triumph in the map of death
and death's dim look in life's mortality
each in her sleep themselves so beautify
as if between them twain there were no strife
but that life lived in death and death in life
her breasts like ivory globes circled with blue
a pair of maiden worlds unconquered
save of their lord no bearing yoke they knew
and him by oath they truly honoured
these worlds in tarquin new ambition bred
who like a foul ursurper went about
from this fair throne to heave the owner out
what could he see but mightily he noted
what did he note but strongly he desired
what he beheld on that he firmly doted
and in his will his wilful eye he tired
with more than admiration he admired
her azure veins her alabaster skin
her coral lips her snowwhite dimpled chin
as the grim lion fawneth o'er his prey
sharp hunger by the conquest satisfied
so o'er this sleeping soul doth tarquin stay
his rage of lust by gazing qualified
slack'd not suppress'd for standing by her side
his eye which late this mutiny restrains
unto a greater uproar tempts his veins
and they like straggling slaves for pillage fighting
obdurate vassals fell exploits effecting
in bloody death and ravishment delighting
nor children's tears nor mothers groans respecting
swell in their pride the onset still expecting
anon his beating heart alarum striking
gives the hot charge and bids them do their liking
his drumming heart cheers up his burning eye
his eye commends the leading to his hand
his hand as proud of such a dignity
smoking with pride march'd on to make his stand
on her bare breast the heart of all her land
whose ranks of blue veins as his hand did scale
left there round turrets destitute and pale
they mustering to the quiet cabinet
where their dear governess and lady lies
do tell her she is dreadfully beset
and fright her with confusion of their cries
she much amazed breaks ope her lock'dup eyes
who peeping forth this tumult to behold
are by his flaming torch dimm'd and controll'd
imagine her as one in dead of night
from forth dull sleep by dreadful fancy waking
that thinks she hath beheld some ghastly sprite
whose grim aspect sets every joint ashaking
what terror or tis but she in worser taking
from sleep disturbed heedfully doth view
the sight which makes supposed terror true
wrapp'd and confounded in a thousand fears
like to a newkill'd bird she trembling lies
she dares not look yet winking there appears
quickshifting antics ugly in her eyes
such shadows are the weak brain's forgeries
who angry that the eyes fly from their lights
in darkness daunts them with more dreadful sights
his hand that yet remains upon her breast
rude ram to batter such an ivory wall
may feel her heartpoor citizendistress'd
wounding itself to death rise up and fall
beating her bulk that his hand shakes withal
this moves in him more rage and lesser pity
to make the breach and enter this sweet city
first like a trumpet doth his tongue begin
to sound a parley to his heartless foe
who o'er the white sheet peers her whiter chin
the reason of this rash alarm to know
which he by dumb demeanor seeks to show
but she with vehement prayers urgeth still
under what colour he commits this ill
thus he replies the colour in thy face
that even for anger makes the lily pale
and the red rose blush at her own disgrace
shall plead for me and tell my loving tale
under that colour am i come to scale
thy neverconquer'd fort the fault is thine
for those thine eyes betray thee unto mine
'thus i forestall thee if thou mean to chide
thy beauty hath ensnared thee to this night
where thou with patience must my will abide
my will that marks thee for my earth's delight
which i to conquer sought with all my might
but as reproof and reason beat it dead
by thy bright beauty was it newly bred
'i see what crosses my attempt will bring
i know what thorns the growing rose defends
i think the honey guarded with a sting
all this beforehand counsel comprehends
but will is deaf and hears no heedful friends
only he hath an eye to gaze on beauty
and dotes on what he looks gainst law or duty
'i have debated even in my soul
what wrong what shame what sorrow i shall breed
but nothing can affection's course control
or stop the headlong fury of his speed
i know repentant tears ensue the deed
reproach disdain and deadly enmity
yet strive i to embrace mine infamy'
this said he shakes aloft his roman blade
which like a falcon towering in the skies
coucheth the fowl below with his wings shade
whose crooked beak threats if he mount he dies
so under his insulting falchion lies
harmless lucretia marking what he tells
with trembling fear as fowl hear falcon's bells
'lucrece quoth he'this night i must enjoy thee
if thou deny then force must work my way
for in thy bed i purpose to destroy thee
that done some worthless slave of thine i'll slay
to kill thine honour with thy life's decay
and in thy dead arms do i mean to place him
swearing i slew him seeing thee embrace him
'so thy surviving husband shall remain
the scornful mark of every open eye
thy kinsmen hang their heads at this disdain
thy issue blurr'd with nameless bastardy
and thou the author of their obloquy
shalt have thy trespass cited up in rhymes
and sung by children in succeeding times
'but if thou yield i rest thy secret friend
the fault unknown is as a thought unacted
a little harm done to a great good end
for lawful policy remains enacted
the poisonous simple sometimes is compacted
in a pure compound being so applied
his venom in effect is purified
'then for thy husband and thy children's sake
tender my suit bequeath not to their lot
the shame that from them no device can take
the blemish that will never be forgot
worse than a slavish wipe or birthhour's blot
for marks descried in men's nativity
are nature's faults not their own infamy'
here with a cockatrice deadkilling eye
he rouseth up himself and makes a pause
while she the picture of pure piety
like a white hind under the gripe's sharp claws
pleads in a wilderness where are no laws
to the rough beast that knows no gentle right
nor aught obeys but his foul appetite
but when a blackfaced cloud the world doth threat
in his dim mist the aspiring mountains hiding
from earth's dark womb some gentle gust doth get
which blows these pitchy vapours from their bidding
hindering their present fall by this dividing
so his unhallow'd haste her words delays
and moody pluto winks while orpheus plays
yet foul nightwaking cat he doth but dally
while in his holdfast foot the weak mouse panteth
her sad behavior feeds his vulture folly
a swallowing gulf that even in plenty wanteth
his ear her prayers admits but his heart granteth
no penetrable entrance to her plaining
tears harden lust though marble wear with raining
her pitypleading eyes are sadly fix'd
in the remorseless wrinkles of his face
her modest eloquence with sighs is mix'd
which to her oratory adds more grace
she puts the period often from his place
and midst the sentence so her accent breaks
that twice she doth begin ere once she speaks
she conjures him by high almighty jove
by knighthood gentry and sweet friendship's oath
by her untimely tears her husband's love
by holy human law and common troth
by heaven and earth and all the power of both
that to his borrow'd bed he make retire
and stoop to honour not to foul desire
quoth she reward not hospitality
with such black payment as thou hast pretended
