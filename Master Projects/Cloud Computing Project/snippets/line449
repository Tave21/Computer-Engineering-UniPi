 for the which you are to do me both a present and a
 dangerous courtesy
provost pray sir in what
duke vincentio in the delaying death
provost a lack how may i do it having the hour limited
 and an express command under penalty to deliver
 his head in the view of angelo i may make my case
 as claudio's to cross this in the smallest
duke vincentio by the vow of mine order i warrant you if my
 instructions may be your guide let this barnardine
 be this morning executed and his head born to angelo
provost angelo hath seen them both and will discover the favour
duke vincentio o death's a great disguiser and you may add to it
 shave the head and tie the beard and say it was
 the desire of the penitent to be so bared before his
 death you know the course is common if any thing
 fall to you upon this more than thanks and good
 fortune by the saint whom i profess i will plead
 against it with my life
provost pardon me good father it is against my oath
duke vincentio were you sworn to the duke or to the deputy
provost to him and to his substitutes
duke vincentio you will think you have made no offence if the duke
 avouch the justice of your dealing
provost but what likelihood is in that
duke vincentio not a resemblance but a certainty yet since i see
 you fearful that neither my coat integrity nor
 persuasion can with ease attempt you i will go
 further than i meant to pluck all fears out of you
 look you sir here is the hand and seal of the
 duke you know the character i doubt not and the
 signet is not strange to you
provost i know them both
duke vincentio the contents of this is the return of the duke you
 shall anon overread it at your pleasure where you
 shall find within these two days he will be here
 this is a thing that angelo knows not for he this
 very day receives letters of strange tenor
 perchance of the duke's death perchance entering
 into some monastery but by chance nothing of what
 is writ look the unfolding star calls up the
 shepherd put not yourself into amazement how these
 things should be all difficulties are but easy
 when they are known call your executioner and off
 with barnardine's head i will give him a present
 shrift and advise him for a better place yet you
 are amazed but this shall absolutely resolve you
 come away it is almost clear dawn
