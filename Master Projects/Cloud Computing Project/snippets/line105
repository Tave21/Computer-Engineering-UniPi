as silver is melted in the midst of the furnace so shall ye be melted in the midst thereof and ye shall know that i the lord have poured out my fury upon you
and the word of the lord came unto me saying
son of man say unto her thou art the land that is not cleansed nor rained upon in the day of indignation
there is a conspiracy of her prophets in the midst thereof like a roaring lion ravening the prey they have devoured souls they have taken the treasure and precious things they have made her many widows in the midst thereof
her priests have violated my law and have profaned mine holy things they have put no difference between the holy and profane neither have they shewed difference between the unclean and the clean and have hid their eyes from my sabbaths and i am profaned among them
her princes in the midst thereof are like wolves ravening the prey to shed blood and to destroy souls to get dishonest gain
and her prophets have daubed them with untempered morter seeing vanity and divining lies unto them saying thus saith the lord god when the lord hath not spoken
the people of the land have used oppression and exercised robbery and have vexed the poor and needy yea they have oppressed the stranger wrongfully
and i sought for a man among them that should make up the hedge and stand in the gap before me for the land that i should not destroy it but i found none
therefore have i poured out mine indignation upon them i have consumed them with the fire of my wrath their own way have i recompensed upon their heads saith the lord god
the word of the lord came again unto me saying
son of man there were two women the daughters of one mother
and they committed whoredoms in egypt they committed whoredoms in their youth there were their breasts pressed and there they bruised the teats of their virginity
and the names of them were aholah the elder and aholibah her sister and they were mine and they bare sons and daughters thus were their names samaria is aholah and jerusalem aholibah
and aholah played the harlot when she was mine and she doted on her lovers on the assyrians her neighbours
which were clothed with blue captains and rulers all of them desirable young men horsemen riding upon horses
thus she committed her whoredoms with them with all them that were the chosen men of assyria and with all on whom she doted with all their idols she defiled herself
neither left she her whoredoms brought from egypt for in her youth they lay with her and they bruised the breasts of her virginity and poured their whoredom upon her
wherefore i have delivered her into the hand of her lovers into the hand of the assyrians upon whom she doted
these discovered her nakedness they took her sons and her daughters and slew her with the sword and she became famous among women for they had executed judgment upon her
and when her sister aholibah saw this she was more corrupt in her inordinate love than she and in her whoredoms more than her sister in her whoredoms
she doted upon the assyrians her neighbours captains and rulers clothed most gorgeously horsemen riding upon horses all of them desirable young men
then i saw that she was defiled that they took both one way
and that she increased her whoredoms for when she saw men pourtrayed upon the wall the images of the chaldeans pourtrayed with vermilion
girded with girdles upon their loins exceeding in dyed attire upon their heads all of them princes to look to after the manner of the babylonians of chaldea the land of their nativity
and as soon as she saw them with her eyes she doted upon them and sent messengers unto them into chaldea
and the babylonians came to her into the bed of love and they defiled her with their whoredom and she was polluted with them and her mind was alienated from them
so she discovered her whoredoms and discovered her nakedness then my mind was alienated from her like as my mind was alienated from her sister
yet she multiplied her whoredoms in calling to remembrance the days of her youth wherein she had played the harlot in the land of egypt
for she doted upon their paramours whose flesh is as the flesh of asses and whose issue is like the issue of horses
thus thou calledst to remembrance the lewdness of thy youth in bruising thy teats by the egyptians for the paps of thy youth
therefore o aholibah thus saith the lord god behold i will raise up thy lovers against thee from whom thy mind is alienated and i will bring them against thee on every side
the babylonians and all the chaldeans pekod and shoa and koa and all the assyrians with them all of them desirable young men captains and rulers great lords and renowned all of them riding upon horses
and they shall come against thee with chariots wagons and wheels and with an assembly of people which shall set against thee buckler and shield and helmet round about and i will set judgment before them and they shall judge thee according to their judgments
and i will set my jealousy against thee and they shall deal furiously with thee they shall take away thy nose and thine ears and thy remnant shall fall by the sword they shall take thy sons and thy daughters and thy residue shall be devoured by the fire
they shall also strip thee out of thy clothes and take away thy fair jewels
thus will i make thy lewdness to cease from thee and thy whoredom brought from the land of egypt so that thou shalt not lift up thine eyes unto them nor remember egypt any more
for thus saith the lord god behold i will deliver thee into the hand of them whom thou hatest into the hand of them from whom thy mind is alienated
and they shall deal with thee hatefully and shall take away all thy labour and shall leave thee naked and bare and the nakedness of thy whoredoms shall be discovered both thy lewdness and thy whoredoms
i will do these things unto thee because thou hast gone a whoring after the heathen and because thou art polluted with their idols
thou hast walked in the way of thy sister therefore will i give her cup into thine hand
thus saith the lord god thou shalt drink of thy sister's cup deep and large thou shalt be laughed to scorn and had in derision it containeth much
thou shalt be filled with drunkenness and sorrow with the cup of astonishment and desolation with the cup of thy sister samaria
thou shalt even drink it and suck it out and thou shalt break the sherds thereof and pluck off thine own breasts for i have spoken it saith the lord god
therefore thus saith the lord god because thou hast forgotten me and cast me behind thy back therefore bear thou also thy lewdness and thy whoredoms
the lord said moreover unto me son of man wilt thou judge aholah and aholibah yea declare unto them their abominations
that they have committed adultery and blood is in their hands and with their idols have they committed adultery and have also caused their sons whom they bare unto me to pass for them through the fire to devour them
moreover this they have done unto me they have defiled my sanctuary in the same day and have profaned my sabbaths
for when they had slain their children to their idols then they came the same day into my sanctuary to profane it and lo thus have they done in the midst of mine house
and furthermore that ye have sent for men to come from far unto whom a messenger was sent and lo they came for whom thou didst wash thyself paintedst thy eyes and deckedst thyself with ornaments
and satest upon a stately bed and a table prepared before it whereupon thou hast set mine incense and mine oil
and a voice of a multitude being at ease was with her and with the men of the common sort were brought sabeans from the wilderness which put bracelets upon their hands and beautiful crowns upon their heads
then said i unto her that was old in adulteries will they now commit whoredoms with her and she with them
yet they went in unto her as they go in unto a woman that playeth the harlot so went they in unto aholah and unto aholibah the lewd women
and the righteous men they shall judge them after the manner of adulteresses and after the manner of women that shed blood because they are adulteresses and blood is in their hands
for thus saith the lord god i will bring up a company upon them and will give them to be removed and spoiled
and the company shall stone them with stones and dispatch them with their swords they shall slay their sons and their daughters and burn up their houses with fire
thus will i cause lewdness to cease out of the land that all women may be taught not to do after your lewdness
and they shall recompense your lewdness upon you and ye shall bear the sins of your idols and ye shall know that i am the lord god
again in the ninth year in the tenth month in the tenth day of the month the word of the lord came unto me saying
son of man write thee the name of the day even of this same day the king of babylon set himself against jerusalem this same day
and utter a parable unto the rebellious house and say unto them thus saith the lord god set on a pot set it on and also pour water into it
gather the pieces thereof into it even every good piece the thigh and the shoulder fill it with the choice bones
take the choice of the flock and burn also the bones under it and make it boil well and let them seethe the bones of it therein
wherefore thus saith the lord god woe to the bloody city to the pot whose scum is therein and whose scum is not gone out of it bring it out piece by piece let no lot fall upon it
for her blood is in the midst of her she set it upon the top of a rock she poured it not upon the ground to cover it with dust
that it might cause fury to come up to take vengeance i have set her blood upon the top of a rock that it should not be covered
therefore thus saith the lord god woe to the bloody city i will even make the pile for fire great
heap on wood kindle the fire consume the flesh and spice it well and let the bones be burned
then set it empty upon the coals thereof that the brass of it may be hot and may burn and that the filthiness of it may be molten in it that the scum of it may be consumed
she hath wearied herself with lies and her great scum went not forth out of her her scum shall be in the fire
in thy filthiness is lewdness because i have purged thee and thou wast not purged thou shalt not be purged from thy filthiness any more till i have caused my fury to rest upon thee
i the lord have spoken it it shall come to pass and i will do it i will not go back neither will i spare neither will i repent according to thy ways and according to thy doings shall they judge thee saith the lord god
also the word of the lord came unto me saying
son of man behold i take away from thee the desire of thine eyes with a stroke yet neither shalt thou mourn nor weep neither shall thy tears run down
forbear to cry make no mourning for the dead bind the tire of thine head upon thee and put on thy shoes upon thy feet and cover not thy lips and eat not the bread of men
so i spake unto the people in the morning and at even my wife died and i did in the morning as i was commanded
and the people said unto me wilt thou not tell us what these things are to us that thou doest so
then i answered them the word of the lord came unto me saying
speak unto the house of israel thus saith the lord god behold i will profane my sanctuary the excellency of your strength the desire of your eyes and that which your soul pitieth and your sons and your daughters whom ye have left shall fall by the sword
and ye shall do as i have done ye shall not cover your lips nor eat the bread of men
and your tires shall be upon your heads and your shoes upon your feet ye shall not mourn nor weep but ye shall pine away for your iniquities and mourn one toward another
thus ezekiel is unto you a sign according to all that he hath done shall ye do and when this cometh ye shall know that i am the lord god
also thou son of man shall it not be in the day when i take from them their strength the joy of their glory the desire of their eyes and that whereupon they set their minds their sons and their daughters
that he that escapeth in that day shall come unto thee to cause thee to hear it with thine ears
in that day shall thy mouth be opened to him which is escaped and thou shalt speak and be no more dumb and thou shalt be a sign unto them and they shall know that i am the lord
the word of the lord came again unto me saying
son of man set thy face against the ammonites and prophesy against them
and say unto the ammonites hear the word of the lord god thus saith the lord god because thou saidst aha against my sanctuary when it was profaned and against the land of israel when it was desolate and against the house of judah when they went into captivity
behold therefore i will deliver thee to the men of the east for a possession and they shall set their palaces in thee and make their dwellings in thee they shall eat thy fruit and they shall drink thy milk
and i will make rabbah a stable for camels and the ammonites a couching place for flocks and ye shall know that i am the lord
for thus saith the lord god because thou hast clapped thine hands and stamped with the feet and rejoiced in heart with all thy despite against the land of israel
behold therefore i will stretch out mine hand upon thee and will deliver thee for a spoil to the heathen and i will cut thee off from the people and i will cause thee to perish out of the countries i will destroy thee and thou shalt know that i am the lord
thus saith the lord god because that moab and seir do say behold the house of judah is like unto all the heathen
therefore behold i will open the side of moab from the cities from his cities which are on his frontiers the glory of the country bethjeshimoth baalmeon and kiriathaim
unto the men of the east with the ammonites and will give them in possession that the ammonites may not be remembered among the nations
and i will execute judgments upon moab and they shall know that i am the lord
thus saith the lord god because that edom hath dealt against the house of judah by taking vengeance and hath greatly offended and revenged himself upon them
therefore thus saith the lord god i will also stretch out mine hand upon edom and will cut off man and beast from it and i will make it desolate from teman and they of dedan shall fall by the sword
and i will lay my vengeance upon edom by the hand of my people israel and they shall do in edom according to mine anger and according to my fury and they shall know my vengeance saith the lord god
thus saith the lord god because the philistines have dealt by revenge and have taken vengeance with a despiteful heart to destroy it for the old hatred
therefore thus saith the lord god behold i will stretch out mine hand upon the philistines and i will cut off the cherethims and destroy the remnant of the sea coast
and i will execute great vengeance upon them with furious rebukes and they shall know that i am the lord when i shall lay my vengeance upon them
and it came to pass in the eleventh year in the first day of the month that the word of the lord came unto me saying
son of man because that tyrus hath said against jerusalem aha she is broken that was the gates of the people she is turned unto me i shall be replenished now she is laid waste
therefore thus saith the lord god behold i am against thee o tyrus and will cause many nations to come up against thee as the sea causeth his waves to come up
and they shall destroy the walls of tyrus and break down her towers i will also scrape her dust from her and make her like the top of a rock
it shall be a place for the spreading of nets in the midst of the sea for i have spoken it saith the lord god and it shall become a spoil to the nations
and her daughters which are in the field shall be slain by the sword and they shall know that i am the lord
for thus saith the lord god behold i will bring upon tyrus nebuchadrezzar king of babylon a king of kings from the north with horses and with chariots and with horsemen and companies and much people
he shall slay with the sword thy daughters in the field and he shall make a fort against thee and cast a mount against thee and lift up the buckler against thee
and he shall set engines of war against thy walls and with his axes he shall break down thy towers
by reason of the abundance of his horses their dust shall cover thee thy walls shall shake at the noise of the horsemen and of the wheels and of the chariots when he shall enter into thy gates as men enter into a city wherein is made a breach
with the hoofs of his horses shall he tread down all thy streets he shall slay thy people by the sword and thy strong garrisons shall go down to the ground
and they shall make a spoil of thy riches and make a prey of thy merchandise and they shall break down thy walls and destroy thy pleasant houses and they shall lay thy stones and thy timber and thy dust in the midst of the water
and i will cause the noise of thy songs to cease and the sound of thy harps shall be no more heard
and i will make thee like the top of a rock thou shalt be a place to spread nets upon thou shalt be built no more for i the lord have spoken it saith the lord god
thus saith the lord god to tyrus shall not the isles shake at the sound of thy fall when the wounded cry when the slaughter is made in the midst of thee
then all the princes of the sea shall come down from their thrones and lay away their robes and put off their broidered garments they shall clothe themselves with trembling they shall sit upon the ground and shall tremble at every moment and be astonished at thee
and they shall take up a lamentation for thee and say to thee how art thou destroyed that wast inhabited of seafaring men the renowned city which wast strong in the sea she and her inhabitants which cause their terror to be on all that haunt it
now shall the isles tremble in the day of thy fall yea the isles that are in the sea shall be troubled at thy departure
for thus saith the lord god when i shall make thee a desolate city like the cities that are not inhabited when i shall bring up the deep upon thee and great waters shall cover thee
when i shall bring thee down with them that descend into the pit with the people of old time and shall set thee in the low parts of the earth in places desolate of old with them that go down to the pit that thou be not inhabited and i shall set glory in the land of the living
i will make thee a terror and thou shalt be no more though thou be sought for yet shalt thou never be found again saith the lord god
the word of the lord came again unto me saying
now thou son of man take up a lamentation for tyrus
and say unto tyrus o thou that art situate at the entry of the sea which art a merchant of the people for many isles thus saith the lord god o tyrus thou hast said i am of perfect beauty
thy borders are in the midst of the seas thy builders have perfected thy beauty
they have made all thy ship boards of fir trees of senir they have taken cedars from lebanon to make masts for thee

the ships of tarshish did sing of thee in thy market and thou wast replenished and made very glorious in the midst of the seas
thy rowers have brought thee into great waters the east wind hath broken thee in the midst of the seas
thy riches and thy fairs thy merchandise thy mariners and thy pilots thy calkers and the occupiers of thy merchandise and all thy men of war that are in thee and in all thy company which is in the midst of thee shall fall into the midst of the seas in the day of thy ruin
the suburbs shall shake at the sound of the cry of thy pilots
and all that handle the oar the mariners and all the pilots of the sea shall come down from their ships they shall stand upon the land
and shall cause their voice to be heard against thee and shall cry bitterly and shall cast up dust upon their heads they shall wallow themselves in the ashes
and they shall make themselves utterly bald for thee and gird them with sackcloth and they shall weep for thee with bitterness of heart and bitter wailing
and in their wailing they shall take up a lamentation for thee and lament over thee saying what city is like tyrus like the destroyed in the midst of the sea
when thy wares went forth out of the seas thou filledst many people thou didst enrich the kings of the earth with the multitude of thy riches and of thy merchandise
in the time when thou shalt be broken by the seas in the depths of the waters thy merchandise and all thy company in the midst of thee shall fall
all the inhabitants of the isles shall be astonished at thee and their kings shall be sore afraid they shall be troubled in their countenance
the merchants among the people shall hiss at thee thou shalt be a terror and never shalt be any more
the word of the lord came again unto me saying
son of man say unto the prince of tyrus thus saith the lord god because thine heart is lifted up and thou hast said i am a god i sit in the seat of god in the midst of the seas yet thou art a man and not god though thou set thine heart as the heart of god
behold thou art wiser than daniel there is no secret that they can hide from thee
with thy wisdom and with thine understanding thou hast gotten thee riches and hast gotten gold and silver into thy treasures
by thy great wisdom and by thy traffick hast thou increased thy riches and thine heart is lifted up because of thy riches
therefore thus saith the lord god because thou hast set thine heart as the heart of god
behold therefore i will bring strangers upon thee the terrible of the nations and they shall draw their swords against the beauty of thy wisdom and they shall defile thy brightness
they shall bring thee down to the pit and thou shalt die the deaths of them that are slain in the midst of the seas
wilt thou yet say before him that slayeth thee i am god but thou shalt be a man and no god in the hand of him that slayeth thee
thou shalt die the deaths of the uncircumcised by the hand of strangers for i have spoken it saith the lord god
moreover the word of the lord came unto me saying
son of man take up a lamentation upon the king of tyrus and say unto him thus saith the lord god thou sealest up the sum full of wisdom and perfect in beauty
thou hast been in eden the garden of god every precious stone was thy covering the sardius topaz and the diamond the beryl the onyx and the jasper the sapphire the emerald and the carbuncle and gold the workmanship of thy tabrets and of thy pipes was prepared in thee in the day that thou wast created
thou art the anointed cherub that covereth and i have set thee so thou wast upon the holy mountain of god thou hast walked up and down in the midst of the stones of fire
thou wast perfect in thy ways from the day that thou wast created till iniquity was found in thee
by the multitude of thy merchandise they have filled the midst of thee with violence and thou hast sinned therefore i will cast thee as profane out of the mountain of god and i will destroy thee o covering cherub from the midst of the stones of fire

all they that know thee among the people shall be astonished at thee thou shalt be a terror and never shalt thou be any more
again the word of the lord came unto me saying
son of man set thy face against zidon and prophesy against it
and say thus saith the lord god behold i am against thee o zidon and i will be glorified in the midst of thee and they shall know that i am the lord when i shall have executed judgments in her and shall be sanctified in her
for i will send into her pestilence and blood into her streets and the wounded shall be judged in the midst of her by the sword upon her on every side and they shall know that i am the lord
and there shall be no more a pricking brier unto the house of israel nor any grieving thorn of all that are round about them that despised them and they shall know that i am the lord god
thus saith the lord god when i shall have gathered the house of israel from the people among whom they are scattered and shall be sanctified in them in the sight of the heathen then shall they dwell in their land that i have given to my servant jacob
and they shall dwell safely therein and shall build houses and plant vineyards yea they shall dwell with confidence when i have executed judgments upon all those that despise them round about them and they shall know that i am the lord their god
in the tenth year in the tenth month in the twelfth day of the month the word of the lord came unto me saying
son of man set thy face against pharaoh king of egypt and prophesy against him and against all egypt
speak and say thus saith the lord god behold i am against thee pharaoh king of egypt the great dragon that lieth in the midst of his rivers which hath said my river is mine own and i have made it for myself
but i will put hooks in thy jaws and i will cause the fish of thy rivers to stick unto thy scales and i will bring thee up out of the midst of thy rivers and all the fish of thy rivers shall stick unto thy scales
and i will leave thee thrown into the wilderness thee and all the fish of thy rivers thou shalt fall upon the open fields thou shalt not be brought together nor gathered i have given thee for meat to the beasts of the field and to the fowls of the heaven
and all the inhabitants of egypt shall know that i am the lord because they have been a staff of reed to the house of israel
when they took hold of thee by thy hand thou didst break and rend all their shoulder and when they leaned upon thee thou brakest and madest all their loins to be at a stand
therefore thus saith the lord god behold i will bring a sword upon thee and cut off man and beast out of thee
and the land of egypt shall be desolate and waste and they shall know that i am the lord because he hath said the river is mine and i have made it
behold therefore i am against thee and against thy rivers and i will make the land of egypt utterly waste and desolate from the tower of syene even unto the border of ethiopia
no foot of man shall pass through it nor foot of beast shall pass through it neither shall it be inhabited forty years
and i will make the land of egypt desolate in the midst of the countries that are desolate and her cities among the cities that are laid waste shall be desolate forty years and i will scatter the egyptians among the nations and will disperse them through the countries
yet thus saith the lord god at the end of forty years will i gather the egyptians from the people whither they were scattered
and i will bring again the captivity of egypt and will cause them to return into the land of pathros into the land of their habitation and they shall be there a base kingdom
