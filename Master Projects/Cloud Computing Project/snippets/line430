 though to myself forsworn to thee i'll faithful prove
 those thoughts to me were oaks to thee like
 osiers bow'd
 study his bias leaves and makes his book thine eyes
 where all those pleasures live that art would
 comprehend
 if knowledge be the mark to know thee shall suffice
 well learned is that tongue that well can thee commend
 all ignorant that soul that sees thee without wonder
 which is to me some praise that i thy parts admire
 thy eye jove's lightning bears thy voice his dreadful thunder
 which not to anger bent is music and sweet fire
 celestial as thou art o pardon love this wrong
 that sings heaven's praise with such an earthly tongue
holofernes you find not the apostraphas and so miss the
 accent let me supervise the canzonet here are
 only numbers ratified but for the elegancy
 facility and golden cadence of poesy caret
 ovidius naso was the man and why indeed naso
 but for smelling out the odouriferous flowers of
 fancy the jerks of invention imitari is nothing
 so doth the hound his master the ape his keeper
 the tired horse his rider but damosella virgin
 was this directed to you

 love's labours lost
act iv
scene iii the same
 enter biron with a paper
biron the king he is hunting the deer i am coursing
 myself they have pitched a toil i am toiling in
 a pitchpitch that defiles defile a foul
 word well set thee down sorrow for so they say
 the fool said and so say i and i the fool well
 proved wit by the lord this love is as mad as
 ajax it kills sheep it kills me i a sheep
 well proved again o my side i will not love if
 i do hang me i faith i will not o but her
 eyeby this light but for her eye i would not
 love her yes for her two eyes well i do nothing
 in the world but lie and lie in my throat by
 heaven i do love and it hath taught me to rhyme
 and to be melancholy and here is part of my rhyme
 and here my melancholy well she hath one o my
 sonnets already the clown bore it the fool sent
 it and the lady hath it sweet clown sweeter
 fool sweetest lady by the world i would not care
 a pin if the other three were in here comes one
 with a paper god give him grace to groan
 stands aside
 enter ferdinand with a paper
ferdinand ay me
biron aside shot by heaven proceed sweet cupid
 thou hast thumped him with thy birdbolt under the
 left pap in faith secrets
ferdinand reads
 so sweet a kiss the golden sun gives not
 to those fresh morning drops upon the rose
 as thy eyebeams when their fresh rays have smote
 the night of dew that on my cheeks down flows
 nor shines the silver moon one half so bright
 through the transparent bosom of the deep
 as doth thy face through tears of mine give light
 thou shinest in every tear that i do weep
 no drop but as a coach doth carry thee
 so ridest thou triumphing in my woe
 do but behold the tears that swell in me
 and they thy glory through my grief will show
 but do not love thyself then thou wilt keep
 my tears for glasses and still make me weep
 o queen of queens how far dost thou excel
 no thought can think nor tongue of mortal tell
 how shall she know my griefs i'll drop the paper
 sweet leaves shade folly who is he comes here
 steps aside
 what longaville and reading listen ear
biron now in thy likeness one more fool appear
 enter longaville with a paper
longaville ay me i am forsworn
biron why he comes in like a perjure wearing papers
ferdinand in love i hope sweet fellowship in shame
biron one drunkard loves another of the name
longaville am i the first that have been perjured so
biron i could put thee in comfort not by two that i know
 thou makest the triumviry the cornercap of society
 the shape of love's tyburn that hangs up simplicity
longaville i fear these stubborn lines lack power to move
 o sweet maria empress of my love
 these numbers will i tear and write in prose
biron o rhymes are guards on wanton cupid's hose
 disfigure not his slop
longaville this same shall go
 reads
 did not the heavenly rhetoric of thine eye
 gainst whom the world cannot hold argument
 persuade my heart to this false perjury
 vows for thee broke deserve not punishment
 a woman i forswore but i will prove
 thou being a goddess i forswore not thee
 my vow was earthly thou a heavenly love
 thy grace being gain'd cures all disgrace in me
 vows are but breath and breath a vapour is
 then thou fair sun which on my earth dost shine
 exhalest this vapourvow in thee it is
 if broken then it is no fault of mine
 if by me broke what fool is not so wise
 to lose an oath to win a paradise
biron this is the livervein which makes flesh a deity
 a green goose a goddess pure pure idolatry
 god amend us god amend we are much out o the way
longaville by whom shall i send thiscompany stay
 steps aside
biron all hid all hid an old infant play
 like a demigod here sit i in the sky
 and wretched fools secrets heedfully o'ereye
 more sacks to the mill o heavens i have my wish
 enter dumain with a paper
 dumain transform'd four woodcocks in a dish
dumain o most divine kate
biron o most profane coxcomb
dumain by heaven the wonder in a mortal eye
biron by earth she is not corporal there you lie
dumain her amber hair for foul hath amber quoted
biron an ambercolour'd raven was well noted
dumain as upright as the cedar
biron stoop i say
 her shoulder is with child
dumain as fair as day
biron ay as some days but then no sun must shine
dumain o that i had my wish
longaville and i had mine
ferdinand and i mine too good lord
biron amen so i had mine is not that a good word
dumain i would forget her but a fever she
 reigns in my blood and will remember'd be
biron a fever in your blood why then incision
 would let her out in saucers sweet misprision
dumain once more i'll read the ode that i have writ
biron once more i'll mark how love can vary wit
dumain reads
 on a dayalack the day
 love whose month is ever may
 spied a blossom passing fair
 playing in the wanton air
 through the velvet leaves the wind
 all unseen can passage find
 that the lover sick to death
 wish himself the heaven's breath
 air quoth he thy cheeks may blow
 air would i might triumph so
 but alack my hand is sworn
 ne'er to pluck thee from thy thorn
 vow alack for youth unmeet
 youth so apt to pluck a sweet
 do not call it sin in me
 that i am forsworn for thee
 thou for whom jove would swear
 juno but an ethiope were
 and deny himself for jove
 turning mortal for thy love
 this will i send and something else more plain
