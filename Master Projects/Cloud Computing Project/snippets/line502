 thief this seven year a goes up and down like a
 gentleman i remember his name
borachio didst thou not hear somebody
conrade no twas the vane on the house
borachio seest thou not i say what a deformed thief this
 fashion is how giddily a turns about all the hot
 bloods between fourteen and fiveandthirty
 sometimes fashioning them like pharaoh's soldiers
 in the reeky painting sometime like god bel's
 priests in the old churchwindow sometime like the
 shaven hercules in the smirched wormeaten tapestry
 where his codpiece seems as massy as his club
conrade all this i see and i see that the fashion wears
 out more apparel than the man but art not thou
 thyself giddy with the fashion too that thou hast
 shifted out of thy tale into telling me of the fashion
borachio not so neither but know that i have tonight
 wooed margaret the lady hero's gentlewoman by the
 name of hero she leans me out at her mistress'
 chamberwindow bids me a thousand times good
 nighti tell this tale vilelyi should first
 tell thee how the prince claudio and my master
 planted and placed and possessed by my master don
 john saw afar off in the orchard this amiable encounter
conrade and thought they margaret was hero
borachio two of them did the prince and claudio but the
 devil my master knew she was margaret and partly
 by his oaths which first possessed them partly by
 the dark night which did deceive them but chiefly
 by my villany which did confirm any slander that
 don john had made away went claudio enraged swore
 he would meet her as he was appointed next morning
 at the temple and there before the whole
 congregation shame her with what he saw o'er night
 and send her home again without a husband
first watchman we charge you in the prince's name stand
second watchman call up the right master constable we have here
 recovered the most dangerous piece of lechery that
 ever was known in the commonwealth
