two women shall be grinding at the mill the one shall be taken and the other left
watch therefore for ye know not what hour your lord doth come
but know this that if the goodman of the house had known in what watch the thief would come he would have watched and would not have suffered his house to be broken up
therefore be ye also ready for in such an hour as ye think not the son of man cometh
who then is a faithful and wise servant whom his lord hath made ruler over his household to give them meat in due season
blessed is that servant whom his lord when he cometh shall find so doing
verily i say unto you that he shall make him ruler over all his goods
but and if that evil servant shall say in his heart my lord delayeth his coming
and shall begin to smite his fellowservants and to eat and drink with the drunken
the lord of that servant shall come in a day when he looketh not for him and in an hour that he is not aware of
and shall cut him asunder and appoint him his portion with the hypocrites there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth
then shall the kingdom of heaven be likened unto ten virgins which took their lamps and went forth to meet the bridegroom
and five of them were wise and five were foolish
they that were foolish took their lamps and took no oil with them
but the wise took oil in their vessels with their lamps
while the bridegroom tarried they all slumbered and slept
and at midnight there was a cry made behold the bridegroom cometh go ye out to meet him
then all those virgins arose and trimmed their lamps
and the foolish said unto the wise give us of your oil for our lamps are gone out
but the wise answered saying not so lest there be not enough for us and you but go ye rather to them that sell and buy for yourselves
and while they went to buy the bridegroom came and they that were ready went in with him to the marriage and the door was shut
afterward came also the other virgins saying lord lord open to us
but he answered and said verily i say unto you i know you not
watch therefore for ye know neither the day nor the hour wherein the son of man cometh
for the kingdom of heaven is as a man travelling into a far country who called his own servants and delivered unto them his goods
and unto one he gave five talents to another two and to another one to every man according to his several ability and straightway took his journey
then he that had received the five talents went and traded with the same and made them other five talents
and likewise he that had received two he also gained other two
but he that had received one went and digged in the earth and hid his lord's money
after a long time the lord of those servants cometh and reckoneth with them
and so he that had received five talents came and brought other five talents saying lord thou deliveredst unto me five talents behold i have gained beside them five talents more
his lord said unto him well done thou good and faithful servant thou hast been faithful over a few things i will make thee ruler over many things enter thou into the joy of thy lord
he also that had received two talents came and said lord thou deliveredst unto me two talents behold i have gained two other talents beside them
his lord said unto him well done good and faithful servant thou hast been faithful over a few things i will make thee ruler over many things enter thou into the joy of thy lord
then he which had received the one talent came and said lord i knew thee that thou art an hard man reaping where thou hast not sown and gathering where thou hast not strawed
and i was afraid and went and hid thy talent in the earth lo there thou hast that is thine
his lord answered and said unto him thou wicked and slothful servant thou knewest that i reap where i sowed not and gather where i have not strawed
thou oughtest therefore to have put my money to the exchangers and then at my coming i should have received mine own with usury
take therefore the talent from him and give it unto him which hath ten talents
for unto every one that hath shall be given and he shall have abundance but from him that hath not shall be taken away even that which he hath
and cast ye the unprofitable servant into outer darkness there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth
when the son of man shall come in his glory and all the holy angels with him then shall he sit upon the throne of his glory
and before him shall be gathered all nations and he shall separate them one from another as a shepherd divideth his sheep from the goats
and he shall set the sheep on his right hand but the goats on the left
then shall the king say unto them on his right hand come ye blessed of my father inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world
for i was an hungred and ye gave me meat i was thirsty and ye gave me drink i was a stranger and ye took me in
naked and ye clothed me i was sick and ye visited me i was in prison and ye came unto me
then shall the righteous answer him saying lord when saw we thee an hungred and fed thee or thirsty and gave thee drink
when saw we thee a stranger and took thee in or naked and clothed thee
or when saw we thee sick or in prison and came unto thee
and the king shall answer and say unto them verily i say unto you inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the least of these my brethren ye have done it unto me
then shall he say also unto them on the left hand depart from me ye cursed into everlasting fire prepared for the devil and his angels
for i was an hungred and ye gave me no meat i was thirsty and ye gave me no drink
i was a stranger and ye took me not in naked and ye clothed me not sick and in prison and ye visited me not
then shall they also answer him saying lord when saw we thee an hungred or athirst or a stranger or naked or sick or in prison and did not minister unto thee
then shall he answer them saying verily i say unto you inasmuch as ye did it not to one of the least of these ye did it not to me
and these shall go away into everlasting punishment but the righteous into life eternal
and it came to pass when jesus had finished all these sayings he said unto his disciples
ye know that after two days is the feast of the passover and the son of man is betrayed to be crucified
then assembled together the chief priests and the scribes and the elders of the people unto the palace of the high priest who was called caiaphas
and consulted that they might take jesus by subtilty and kill him
but they said not on the feast day lest there be an uproar among the people
now when jesus was in bethany in the house of simon the leper
there came unto him a woman having an alabaster box of very precious ointment and poured it on his head as he sat at meat
but when his disciples saw it they had indignation saying to what purpose is this waste
for this ointment might have been sold for much and given to the poor
when jesus understood it he said unto them why trouble ye the woman for she hath wrought a good work upon me
for ye have the poor always with you but me ye have not always
for in that she hath poured this ointment on my body she did it for my burial
verily i say unto you wheresoever this gospel shall be preached in the whole world there shall also this that this woman hath done be told for a memorial of her
then one of the twelve called judas iscariot went unto the chief priests
and said unto them what will ye give me and i will deliver him unto you and they covenanted with him for thirty pieces of silver
and from that time he sought opportunity to betray him
now the first day of the feast of unleavened bread the disciples came to jesus saying unto him where wilt thou that we prepare for thee to eat the passover
and he said go into the city to such a man and say unto him the master saith my time is at hand i will keep the passover at thy house with my disciples
and the disciples did as jesus had appointed them and they made ready the passover
now when the even was come he sat down with the twelve
and as they did eat he said verily i say unto you that one of you shall betray me
and they were exceeding sorrowful and began every one of them to say unto him lord is it i
and he answered and said he that dippeth his hand with me in the dish the same shall betray me
the son of man goeth as it is written of him but woe unto that man by whom the son of man is betrayed it had been good for that man if he had not been born
then judas which betrayed him answered and said master is it i he said unto him thou hast said
and as they were eating jesus took bread and blessed it and brake it and gave it to the disciples and said take eat this is my body
and he took the cup and gave thanks and gave it to them saying drink ye all of it
for this is my blood of the new testament which is shed for many for the remission of sins
but i say unto you i will not drink henceforth of this fruit of the vine until that day when i drink it new with you in my father's kingdom
and when they had sung an hymn they went out into the mount of olives
then saith jesus unto them all ye shall be offended because of me this night for it is written i will smite the shepherd and the sheep of the flock shall be scattered abroad
but after i am risen again i will go before you into galilee
peter answered and said unto him though all men shall be offended because of thee yet will i never be offended
jesus said unto him verily i say unto thee that this night before the cock crow thou shalt deny me thrice
peter said unto him though i should die with thee yet will i not deny thee likewise also said all the disciples
then cometh jesus with them unto a place called gethsemane and saith unto the disciples sit ye here while i go and pray yonder
and he took with him peter and the two sons of zebedee and began to be sorrowful and very heavy
then saith he unto them my soul is exceeding sorrowful even unto death tarry ye here and watch with me
and he went a little farther and fell on his face and prayed saying o my father if it be possible let this cup pass from me nevertheless not as i will but as thou wilt
and he cometh unto the disciples and findeth them asleep and saith unto peter what could ye not watch with me one hour
watch and pray that ye enter not into temptation the spirit indeed is willing but the flesh is weak
he went away again the second time and prayed saying o my father if this cup may not pass away from me except i drink it thy will be done
and he came and found them asleep again for their eyes were heavy
and he left them and went away again and prayed the third time saying the same words
then cometh he to his disciples and saith unto them sleep on now and take your rest behold the hour is at hand and the son of man is betrayed into the hands of sinners
rise let us be going behold he is at hand that doth betray me
and while he yet spake lo judas one of the twelve came and with him a great multitude with swords and staves from the chief priests and elders of the people
now he that betrayed him gave them a sign saying whomsoever i shall kiss that same is he hold him fast
and forthwith he came to jesus and said hail master and kissed him
and jesus said unto him friend wherefore art thou come then came they and laid hands on jesus and took him
and behold one of them which were with jesus stretched out his hand and drew his sword and struck a servant of the high priest's and smote off his ear
then said jesus unto him put up again thy sword into his place for all they that take the sword shall perish with the sword
thinkest thou that i cannot now pray to my father and he shall presently give me more than twelve legions of angels
but how then shall the scriptures be fulfilled that thus it must be
in that same hour said jesus to the multitudes are ye come out as against a thief with swords and staves for to take me i sat daily with you teaching in the temple and ye laid no hold on me
but all this was done that the scriptures of the prophets might be fulfilled then all the disciples forsook him and fled
and they that had laid hold on jesus led him away to caiaphas the high priest where the scribes and the elders were assembled
but peter followed him afar off unto the high priest's palace and went in and sat with the servants to see the end
now the chief priests and elders and all the council sought false witness against jesus to put him to death
but found none yea though many false witnesses came yet found they none at the last came two false witnesses
and said this fellow said i am able to destroy the temple of god and to build it in three days
and the high priest arose and said unto him answerest thou nothing what is it which these witness against thee
but jesus held his peace and the high priest answered and said unto him i adjure thee by the living god that thou tell us whether thou be the christ the son of god
jesus saith unto him thou hast said nevertheless i say unto you hereafter shall ye see the son of man sitting on the right hand of power and coming in the clouds of heaven
then the high priest rent his clothes saying he hath spoken blasphemy what further need have we of witnesses behold now ye have heard his blasphemy
what think ye they answered and said he is guilty of death
then did they spit in his face and buffeted him and others smote him with the palms of their hands
saying prophesy unto us thou christ who is he that smote thee
now peter sat without in the palace and a damsel came unto him saying thou also wast with jesus of galilee
but he denied before them all saying i know not what thou sayest
and when he was gone out into the porch another maid saw him and said unto them that were there this fellow was also with jesus of nazareth
and again he denied with an oath i do not know the man
and after a while came unto him they that stood by and said to peter surely thou also art one of them for thy speech bewrayeth thee
then began he to curse and to swear saying i know not the man and immediately the cock crew
and peter remembered the word of jesus which said unto him before the cock crow thou shalt deny me thrice and he went out and wept bitterly
when the morning was come all the chief priests and elders of the people took counsel against jesus to put him to death
and when they had bound him they led him away and delivered him to pontius pilate the governor
then judas which had betrayed him when he saw that he was condemned repented himself and brought again the thirty pieces of silver to the chief priests and elders
saying i have sinned in that i have betrayed the innocent blood and they said what is that to us see thou to that
and he cast down the pieces of silver in the temple and departed and went and hanged himself
and the chief priests took the silver pieces and said it is not lawful for to put them into the treasury because it is the price of blood
and they took counsel and bought with them the potter's field to bury strangers in
wherefore that field was called the field of blood unto this day
then was fulfilled that which was spoken by jeremy the prophet saying and they took the thirty pieces of silver the price of him that was valued whom they of the children of israel did value
and gave them for the potter's field as the lord appointed me
and jesus stood before the governor and the governor asked him saying art thou the king of the jews and jesus said unto him thou sayest
and when he was accused of the chief priests and elders he answered nothing
then said pilate unto him hearest thou not how many things they witness against thee
and he answered him to never a word insomuch that the governor marvelled greatly
now at that feast the governor was wont to release unto the people a prisoner whom they would
and they had then a notable prisoner called barabbas
therefore when they were gathered together pilate said unto them whom will ye that i release unto you barabbas or jesus which is called christ
for he knew that for envy they had delivered him
when he was set down on the judgment seat his wife sent unto him saying have thou nothing to do with that just man for i have suffered many things this day in a dream because of him
but the chief priests and elders persuaded the multitude that they should ask barabbas and destroy jesus
the governor answered and said unto them whether of the twain will ye that i release unto you they said barabbas
pilate saith unto them what shall i do then with jesus which is called christ they all say unto him let him be crucified
and the governor said why what evil hath he done but they cried out the more saying let him be crucified
when pilate saw that he could prevail nothing but that rather a tumult was made he took water and washed his hands before the multitude saying i am innocent of the blood of this just person see ye to it
then answered all the people and said his blood be on us and on our children
then released he barabbas unto them and when he had scourged jesus he delivered him to be crucified
then the soldiers of the governor took jesus into the common hall and gathered unto him the whole band of soldiers
and they stripped him and put on him a scarlet robe
and when they had platted a crown of thorns they put it upon his head and a reed in his right hand and they bowed the knee before him and mocked him saying hail king of the jews
and they spit upon him and took the reed and smote him on the head
and after that they had mocked him they took the robe off from him and put his own raiment on him and led him away to crucify him
and as they came out they found a man of cyrene simon by name him they compelled to bear his cross
and when they were come unto a place called golgotha that is to say a place of a skull
they gave him vinegar to drink mingled with gall and when he had tasted thereof he would not drink
and they crucified him and parted his garments casting lots that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet they parted my garments among them and upon my vesture did they cast lots
and sitting down they watched him there
and set up over his head his accusation written this is jesus the king of the jews
then were there two thieves crucified with him one on the right hand and another on the left
and they that passed by reviled him wagging their heads
and saying thou that destroyest the temple and buildest it in three days save thyself if thou be the son of god come down from the cross
likewise also the chief priests mocking him with the scribes and elders said
he saved others himself he cannot save if he be the king of israel let him now come down from the cross and we will believe him
he trusted in god let him deliver him now if he will have him for he said i am the son of god
the thieves also which were crucified with him cast the same in his teeth
now from the sixth hour there was darkness over all the land unto the ninth hour
and about the ninth hour jesus cried with a loud voice saying eli eli lama sabachthani that is to say my god my god why hast thou forsaken me
some of them that stood there when they heard that said this man calleth for elias
and straightway one of them ran and took a spunge and filled it with vinegar and put it on a reed and gave him to drink
the rest said let be let us see whether elias will come to save him
jesus when he had cried again with a loud voice yielded up the ghost
and behold the veil of the temple was rent in twain from the top to the bottom and the earth did quake and the rocks rent
and the graves were opened and many bodies of the saints which slept arose
and came out of the graves after his resurrection and went into the holy city and appeared unto many
now when the centurion and they that were with him watching jesus saw the earthquake and those things that were done they feared greatly saying truly this was the son of god
and many women were there beholding afar off which followed jesus from galilee ministering unto him
among which was mary magdalene and mary the mother of james and joses and the mother of zebedee's children
when the even was come there came a rich man of arimathaea named joseph who also himself was jesus disciple
he went to pilate and begged the body of jesus then pilate commanded the body to be delivered
and when joseph had taken the body he wrapped it in a clean linen cloth
and laid it in his own new tomb which he had hewn out in the rock and he rolled a great stone to the door of the sepulchre and departed
and there was mary magdalene and the other mary sitting over against the sepulchre
now the next day that followed the day of the preparation the chief priests and pharisees came together unto pilate
saying sir we remember that that deceiver said while he was yet alive after three days i will rise again
command therefore that the sepulchre be made sure until the third day lest his disciples come by night and steal him away and say unto the people he is risen from the dead so the last error shall be worse than the first
pilate said unto them ye have a watch go your way make it as sure as ye can
so they went and made the sepulchre sure sealing the stone and setting a watch
in the end of the sabbath as it began to dawn toward the first day of the week came mary magdalene and the other mary to see the sepulchre
and behold there was a great earthquake for the angel of the lord descended from heaven and came and rolled back the stone from the door and sat upon it
