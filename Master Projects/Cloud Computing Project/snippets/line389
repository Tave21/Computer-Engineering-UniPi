 little knows this love in me
 and by him seal up thy mind
 whether that thy youth and kind
 will the faithful offer take
 of me and all that i can make
 or else by him my love deny
 and then i'll study how to die
silvius call you this chiding
celia alas poor shepherd
rosalind do you pity him no he deserves no pity wilt
 thou love such a woman what to make thee an
 instrument and play false strains upon thee not to
 be endured well go your way to her for i see
 love hath made thee a tame snake and say this to
 her that if she love me i charge her to love
 thee if she will not i will never have her unless
 thou entreat for her if you be a true lover
 hence and not a word for here comes more company
 exit silvius
 enter oliver
oliver good morrow fair ones pray you if you know
 where in the purlieus of this forest stands
 a sheepcote fenced about with olive trees
celia west of this place down in the neighbour bottom
 the rank of osiers by the murmuring stream
 left on your right hand brings you to the place
 but at this hour the house doth keep itself
 there's none within
oliver if that an eye may profit by a tongue
 then should i know you by description
 such garments and such years the boy is fair
 of female favour and bestows himself
 like a ripe sister the woman low
 and browner than her brother are not you
 the owner of the house i did inquire for
celia it is no boast being ask'd to say we are
oliver orlando doth commend him to you both
 and to that youth he calls his rosalind
 he sends this bloody napkin are you he
rosalind i am what must we understand by this
oliver some of my shame if you will know of me
 what man i am and how and why and where
 this handkercher was stain'd
celia i pray you tell it
oliver when last the young orlando parted from you
 he left a promise to return again
 within an hour and pacing through the forest
 chewing the food of sweet and bitter fancy
 lo what befell he threw his eye aside
 and mark what object did present itself
 under an oak whose boughs were moss'd with age
 and high top bald with dry antiquity
 a wretched ragged man o'ergrown with hair
 lay sleeping on his back about his neck
 a green and gilded snake had wreathed itself
 who with her head nimble in threats approach'd
 the opening of his mouth but suddenly
 seeing orlando it unlink'd itself
 and with indented glides did slip away
 into a bush under which bush's shade
 a lioness with udders all drawn dry
 lay couching head on ground with catlike watch
 when that the sleeping man should stir for tis
 the royal disposition of that beast
 to prey on nothing that doth seem as dead
 this seen orlando did approach the man
 and found it was his brother his elder brother
celia o i have heard him speak of that same brother
 and he did render him the most unnatural
 that lived amongst men
oliver and well he might so do
 for well i know he was unnatural
rosalind but to orlando did he leave him there
 food to the suck'd and hungry lioness
oliver twice did he turn his back and purposed so
 but kindness nobler ever than revenge
 and nature stronger than his just occasion
 made him give battle to the lioness
 who quickly fell before him in which hurtling
 from miserable slumber i awaked
celia are you his brother
rosalind wast you he rescued
celia was't you that did so oft contrive to kill him
oliver twas i but tis not i i do not shame
 to tell you what i was since my conversion
 so sweetly tastes being the thing i am
rosalind but for the bloody napkin
oliver by and by
 when from the first to last betwixt us two
 tears our recountments had most kindly bathed
 as how i came into that desert place
 in brief he led me to the gentle duke
 who gave me fresh array and entertainment
 committing me unto my brother's love
 who led me instantly unto his cave
 there stripp'd himself and here upon his arm
 the lioness had torn some flesh away
 which all this while had bled and now he fainted
 and cried in fainting upon rosalind
 brief i recover'd him bound up his wound
 and after some small space being strong at heart
 he sent me hither stranger as i am
 to tell this story that you might excuse
 his broken promise and to give this napkin
 dyed in his blood unto the shepherd youth
 that he in sport doth call his rosalind
 rosalind swoons
celia why how now ganymede sweet ganymede
oliver many will swoon when they do look on blood
celia there is more in it cousin ganymede
oliver look he recovers
rosalind i would i were at home
celia we'll lead you thither
 i pray you will you take him by the arm
oliver be of good cheer youth you a man you lack a
 man's heart
rosalind i do so i confess it ah sirrah a body would
 think this was well counterfeited i pray you tell
 your brother how well i counterfeited heighho
oliver this was not counterfeit there is too great
 testimony in your complexion that it was a passion
 of earnest
rosalind counterfeit i assure you
oliver well then take a good heart and counterfeit to be a man
rosalind so i do but i faith i should have been a woman by right
celia come you look paler and paler pray you draw
 homewards good sir go with us
oliver that will i for i must bear answer back
 how you excuse my brother rosalind
rosalind i shall devise something but i pray you commend
 my counterfeiting to him will you go
