timon why i was writing of my epitaph
 it will be seen tomorrow my long sickness
 of health and living now begins to mend
 and nothing brings me all things go live still
 be alcibiades your plague you his
 and last so long enough
first senator we speak in vain
timon but yet i love my country and am not
 one that rejoices in the common wreck
 as common bruit doth put it
first senator that's well spoke
timon commend me to my loving countrymen
first senator these words become your lips as they pass
 thorough them
second senator and enter in our ears like great triumphers
 in their applauding gates
timon commend me to them
 and tell them that to ease them of their griefs
 their fears of hostile strokes their aches losses
 their pangs of love with other incident throes
 that nature's fragile vessel doth sustain
 in life's uncertain voyage i will some kindness do them
 i'll teach them to prevent wild alcibiades wrath
first senator i like this well he will return again
timon i have a tree which grows here in my close
 that mine own use invites me to cut down
 and shortly must i fell it tell my friends
 tell athens in the sequence of degree
 from high to low throughout that whoso please
 to stop affliction let him take his haste
 come hither ere my tree hath felt the axe
 and hang himself i pray you do my greeting
flavius trouble him no further thus you still shall find him
timon come not to me again but say to athens
 timon hath made his everlasting mansion
 upon the beached verge of the salt flood
 who once a day with his embossed froth
 the turbulent surge shall cover thither come
 and let my gravestone be your oracle
 lips let sour words go by and language end
 what is amiss plague and infection mend
 graves only be men's works and death their gain
 sun hide thy beams timon hath done his reign
 retires to his cave
first senator his discontents are unremoveably
 coupled to nature
second senator our hope in him is dead let us return
 and strain what other means is left unto us
 in our dear peril
first senator it requires swift foot
 exeunt
 timon of athens
act v
scene ii before the walls of athens
 enter two senators and a messenger
first senator thou hast painfully discover'd are his files
 as full as thy report
messenger have spoke the least
 besides his expedition promises
 present approach
second senator we stand much hazard if they bring not timon
messenger i met a courier one mine ancient friend
 whom though in general part we were opposed
 yet our old love made a particular force
 and made us speak like friends this man was riding
 from alcibiades to timon's cave
 with letters of entreaty which imported
 his fellowship i the cause against your city
 in part for his sake moved
first senator here come our brothers
 enter the senators from timon
third senator no talk of timon nothing of him expect
 the enemies drum is heard and fearful scouring
 doth choke the air with dust in and prepare
 ours is the fall i fear our foes the snare
 exeunt
 timon of athens
act v
scene iii the woods timon's cave and a rude tomb seen
 enter a soldier seeking timon
soldier by all description this should be the place
 who's here speak ho no answer what is this
 timon is dead who hath outstretch'd his span
 some beast rear'd this there does not live a man
 dead sure and this his grave what's on this tomb
 i cannot read the character i'll take with wax
 our captain hath in every figure skill
 an aged interpreter though young in days
 before proud athens he's set down by this
 whose fall the mark of his ambition is
 exit
 timon of athens
act v
scene iv before the walls of athens
 trumpets sound enter alcibiades with his powers
alcibiades sound to this coward and lascivious town
 our terrible approach
 a parley sounded
 enter senators on the walls
 till now you have gone on and fill'd the time
 with all licentious measure making your wills
 the scope of justice till now myself and such
 as slept within the shadow of your power
 have wander'd with our traversed arms and breathed
 our sufferance vainly now the time is flush
 when crouching marrow in the bearer strong
 cries of itself no more now breathless wrong
 shall sit and pant in your great chairs of ease
 and pursy insolence shall break his wind
 with fear and horrid flight
first senator noble and young
 when thy first griefs were but a mere conceit
 ere thou hadst power or we had cause of fear
 we sent to thee to give thy rages balm
 to wipe out our ingratitude with loves
 above their quantity
second senator so did we woo
 transformed timon to our city's love
 by humble message and by promised means
 we were not all unkind nor all deserve
 the common stroke of war
first senator these walls of ours
 were not erected by their hands from whom
 you have received your griefs nor are they such
 that these great towers trophies and schools
 should fall
 for private faults in them
second senator nor are they living
 who were the motives that you first went out
 shame that they wanted cunning in excess
 hath broke their hearts march noble lord
 into our city with thy banners spread
 by decimation and a tithed death
 if thy revenges hunger for that food
 which nature loathestake thou the destined tenth
 and by the hazard of the spotted die
 let die the spotted
first senator all have not offended
 for those that were it is not square to take
 on those that are revenges crimes like lands
 are not inherited then dear countryman
 bring in thy ranks but leave without thy rage
 spare thy athenian cradle and those kin
 which in the bluster of thy wrath must fall
 with those that have offended like a shepherd
 approach the fold and cull the infected forth
 but kill not all together
second senator what thou wilt
 thou rather shalt enforce it with thy smile
 than hew to't with thy sword
first senator set but thy foot
 against our rampired gates and they shall ope
 so thou wilt send thy gentle heart before
 to say thou'lt enter friendly
second senator throw thy glove
 or any token of thine honour else
 that thou wilt use the wars as thy redress
 and not as our confusion all thy powers
 shall make their harbour in our town till we
 have seal'd thy full desire
alcibiades then there's my glove
 descend and open your uncharged ports
 those enemies of timon's and mine own
 whom you yourselves shall set out for reproof
 fall and no more and to atone your fears
 with my more noble meaning not a man
 shall pass his quarter or offend the stream
 of regular justice in your city's bounds
 but shall be render'd to your public laws
 at heaviest answer
both tis most nobly spoken
alcibiades descend and keep your words
 the senators descend and open the gates
 enter soldier
soldier my noble general timon is dead
 entomb'd upon the very hem o the sea
 and on his gravestone this insculpture which
 with wax i brought away whose soft impression
 interprets for my poor ignorance
alcibiades reads the epitaph here lies a
 wretched corse of wretched soul bereft
 seek not my name a plague consume you wicked
 caitiffs left
 here lie i timon who alive all living men did hate
 pass by and curse thy fill but pass and stay
 not here thy gait'
 these well express in thee thy latter spirits
 though thou abhorr'dst in us our human griefs
 scorn'dst our brain's flow and those our
 droplets which
 from niggard nature fall yet rich conceit
 taught thee to make vast neptune weep for aye
 on thy low grave on faults forgiven dead
 is noble timon of whose memory
 hereafter more bring me into your city
 and i will use the olive with my sword
 make war breed peace make peace stint war make each
 prescribe to other as each other's leech
 let our drums strike
 exeunt
