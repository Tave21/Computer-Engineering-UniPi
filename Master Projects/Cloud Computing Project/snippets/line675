 hast caused printing to be used and contrary to
 the king his crown and dignity thou hast built a
 papermill it will be proved to thy face that thou
 hast men about thee that usually talk of a noun and
 a verb and such abominable words as no christian
 ear can endure to hear thou hast appointed
 justices of peace to call poor men before them
