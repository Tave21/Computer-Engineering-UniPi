who hath laid the measures thereof if thou knowest or who hath stretched the line upon it
whereupon are the foundations thereof fastened or who laid the corner stone thereof
when the morning stars sang together and all the sons of god shouted for joy
or who shut up the sea with doors when it brake forth as if it had issued out of the womb
when i made the cloud the garment thereof and thick darkness a swaddlingband for it
and brake up for it my decreed place and set bars and doors
and said hitherto shalt thou come but no further and here shall thy proud waves be stayed
hast thou commanded the morning since thy days and caused the dayspring to know his place
that it might take hold of the ends of the earth that the wicked might be shaken out of it
it is turned as clay to the seal and they stand as a garment
and from the wicked their light is withholden and the high arm shall be broken
hast thou entered into the springs of the sea or hast thou walked in the search of the depth
have the gates of death been opened unto thee or hast thou seen the doors of the shadow of death
hast thou perceived the breadth of the earth declare if thou knowest it all
where is the way where light dwelleth and as for darkness where is the place thereof
that thou shouldest take it to the bound thereof and that thou shouldest know the paths to the house thereof
knowest thou it because thou wast then born or because the number of thy days is great
hast thou entered into the treasures of the snow or hast thou seen the treasures of the hail
which i have reserved against the time of trouble against the day of battle and war
by what way is the light parted which scattereth the east wind upon the earth
who hath divided a watercourse for the overflowing of waters or a way for the lightning of thunder
to cause it to rain on the earth where no man is on the wilderness wherein there is no man
to satisfy the desolate and waste ground and to cause the bud of the tender herb to spring forth
hath the rain a father or who hath begotten the drops of dew
out of whose womb came the ice and the hoary frost of heaven who hath gendered it
the waters are hid as with a stone and the face of the deep is frozen
canst thou bind the sweet influences of pleiades or loose the bands of orion
canst thou bring forth mazzaroth in his season or canst thou guide arcturus with his sons
knowest thou the ordinances of heaven canst thou set the dominion thereof in the earth
canst thou lift up thy voice to the clouds that abundance of waters may cover thee
canst thou send lightnings that they may go and say unto thee here we are
who hath put wisdom in the inward parts or who hath given understanding to the heart
who can number the clouds in wisdom or who can stay the bottles of heaven
when the dust groweth into hardness and the clods cleave fast together
wilt thou hunt the prey for the lion or fill the appetite of the young lions
when they couch in their dens and abide in the covert to lie in wait
who provideth for the raven his food when his young ones cry unto god they wander for lack of meat
knowest thou the time when the wild goats of the rock bring forth or canst thou mark when the hinds do calve
canst thou number the months that they fulfil or knowest thou the time when they bring forth
they bow themselves they bring forth their young ones they cast out their sorrows
their young ones are in good liking they grow up with corn they go forth and return not unto them
who hath sent out the wild ass free or who hath loosed the bands of the wild ass
whose house i have made the wilderness and the barren land his dwellings
he scorneth the multitude of the city neither regardeth he the crying of the driver
the range of the mountains is his pasture and he searcheth after every green thing
will the unicorn be willing to serve thee or abide by thy crib
canst thou bind the unicorn with his band in the furrow or will he harrow the valleys after thee
wilt thou trust him because his strength is great or wilt thou leave thy labour to him
wilt thou believe him that he will bring home thy seed and gather it into thy barn
gavest thou the goodly wings unto the peacocks or wings and feathers unto the ostrich
which leaveth her eggs in the earth and warmeth them in dust
and forgetteth that the foot may crush them or that the wild beast may break them
she is hardened against her young ones as though they were not hers her labour is in vain without fear
because god hath deprived her of wisdom neither hath he imparted to her understanding
what time she lifteth up herself on high she scorneth the horse and his rider
hast thou given the horse strength hast thou clothed his neck with thunder
canst thou make him afraid as a grasshopper the glory of his nostrils is terrible
he paweth in the valley and rejoiceth in his strength he goeth on to meet the armed men
he mocketh at fear and is not affrighted neither turneth he back from the sword
the quiver rattleth against him the glittering spear and the shield
he swalloweth the ground with fierceness and rage neither believeth he that it is the sound of the trumpet
he saith among the trumpets ha ha and he smelleth the battle afar off the thunder of the captains and the shouting
doth the hawk fly by thy wisdom and stretch her wings toward the south
doth the eagle mount up at thy command and make her nest on high
she dwelleth and abideth on the rock upon the crag of the rock and the strong place
from thence she seeketh the prey and her eyes behold afar off
her young ones also suck up blood and where the slain are there is she
moreover the lord answered job and said
shall he that contendeth with the almighty instruct him he that reproveth god let him answer it
then job answered the lord and said
behold i am vile what shall i answer thee i will lay mine hand upon my mouth
once have i spoken but i will not answer yea twice but i will proceed no further
then answered the lord unto job out of the whirlwind and said
gird up thy loins now like a man i will demand of thee and declare thou unto me
wilt thou also disannul my judgment wilt thou condemn me that thou mayest be righteous
hast thou an arm like god or canst thou thunder with a voice like him
deck thyself now with majesty and excellency and array thyself with glory and beauty
cast abroad the rage of thy wrath and behold every one that is proud and abase him
look on every one that is proud and bring him low and tread down the wicked in their place
hide them in the dust together and bind their faces in secret
then will i also confess unto thee that thine own right hand can save thee
behold now behemoth which i made with thee he eateth grass as an ox
lo now his strength is in his loins and his force is in the navel of his belly
he moveth his tail like a cedar the sinews of his stones are wrapped together
his bones are as strong pieces of brass his bones are like bars of iron
he is the chief of the ways of god he that made him can make his sword to approach unto him
surely the mountains bring him forth food where all the beasts of the field play
he lieth under the shady trees in the covert of the reed and fens
the shady trees cover him with their shadow the willows of the brook compass him about
behold he drinketh up a river and hasteth not he trusteth that he can draw up jordan into his mouth
he taketh it with his eyes his nose pierceth through snares
canst thou draw out leviathan with an hook or his tongue with a cord which thou lettest down
canst thou put an hook into his nose or bore his jaw through with a thorn
will he make many supplications unto thee will he speak soft words unto thee
will he make a covenant with thee wilt thou take him for a servant for ever
wilt thou play with him as with a bird or wilt thou bind him for thy maidens
shall the companions make a banquet of him shall they part him among the merchants
canst thou fill his skin with barbed irons or his head with fish spears
lay thine hand upon him remember the battle do no more
behold the hope of him is in vain shall not one be cast down even at the sight of him
none is so fierce that dare stir him up who then is able to stand before me
who hath prevented me that i should repay him whatsoever is under the whole heaven is mine
i will not conceal his parts nor his power nor his comely proportion
who can discover the face of his garment or who can come to him with his double bridle
who can open the doors of his face his teeth are terrible round about
his scales are his pride shut up together as with a close seal
one is so near to another that no air can come between them
they are joined one to another they stick together that they cannot be sundered
by his neesings a light doth shine and his eyes are like the eyelids of the morning
out of his mouth go burning lamps and sparks of fire leap out
out of his nostrils goeth smoke as out of a seething pot or caldron
his breath kindleth coals and a flame goeth out of his mouth
in his neck remaineth strength and sorrow is turned into joy before him
the flakes of his flesh are joined together they are firm in themselves they cannot be moved
his heart is as firm as a stone yea as hard as a piece of the nether millstone
when he raiseth up himself the mighty are afraid by reason of breakings they purify themselves
the sword of him that layeth at him cannot hold the spear the dart nor the habergeon
he esteemeth iron as straw and brass as rotten wood
the arrow cannot make him flee slingstones are turned with him into stubble
darts are counted as stubble he laugheth at the shaking of a spear
sharp stones are under him he spreadeth sharp pointed things upon the mire
he maketh the deep to boil like a pot he maketh the sea like a pot of ointment
he maketh a path to shine after him one would think the deep to be hoary
upon earth there is not his like who is made without fear
he beholdeth all high things he is a king over all the children of pride
then job answered the lord and said
i know that thou canst do every thing and that no thought can be withholden from thee
who is he that hideth counsel without knowledge therefore have i uttered that i understood not things too wonderful for me which i knew not
hear i beseech thee and i will speak i will demand of thee and declare thou unto me
i have heard of thee by the hearing of the ear but now mine eye seeth thee
wherefore i abhor myself and repent in dust and ashes
and it was so that after the lord had spoken these words unto job the lord said to eliphaz the temanite my wrath is kindled against thee and against thy two friends for ye have not spoken of me the thing that is right as my servant job hath
therefore take unto you now seven bullocks and seven rams and go to my servant job and offer up for yourselves a burnt offering and my servant job shall pray for you for him will i accept lest i deal with you after your folly in that ye have not spoken of me the thing which is right like my servant job
so eliphaz the temanite and bildad the shuhite and zophar the naamathite went and did according as the lord commanded them the lord also accepted job
and the lord turned the captivity of job when he prayed for his friends also the lord gave job twice as much as he had before
then came there unto him all his brethren and all his sisters and all they that had been of his acquaintance before and did eat bread with him in his house and they bemoaned him and comforted him over all the evil that the lord had brought upon him every man also gave him a piece of money and every one an earring of gold
so the lord blessed the latter end of job more than his beginning for he had fourteen thousand sheep and six thousand camels and a thousand yoke of oxen and a thousand she asses
he had also seven sons and three daughters
and he called the name of the first jemima and the name of the second kezia and the name of the third kerenhappuch
and in all the land were no women found so fair as the daughters of job and their father gave them inheritance among their brethren
after this lived job an hundred and forty years and saw his sons and his sons sons even four generations
so job died being old and full of days
blessed is the man that walketh not in the counsel of the ungodly nor standeth in the way of sinners nor sitteth in the seat of the scornful
but his delight is in the law of the lord and in his law doth he meditate day and night
and he shall be like a tree planted by the rivers of water that bringeth forth his fruit in his season his leaf also shall not wither and whatsoever he doeth shall prosper
the ungodly are not so but are like the chaff which the wind driveth away
therefore the ungodly shall not stand in the judgment nor sinners in the congregation of the righteous
for the lord knoweth the way of the righteous but the way of the ungodly shall perish
why do the heathen rage and the people imagine a vain thing
the kings of the earth set themselves and the rulers take counsel together against the lord and against his anointed saying
let us break their bands asunder and cast away their cords from us
he that sitteth in the heavens shall laugh the lord shall have them in derision
then shall he speak unto them in his wrath and vex them in his sore displeasure
yet have i set my king upon my holy hill of zion
i will declare the decree the lord hath said unto me thou art my son this day have i begotten thee
ask of me and i shall give thee the heathen for thine inheritance and the uttermost parts of the earth for thy possession
thou shalt break them with a rod of iron thou shalt dash them in pieces like a potter's vessel
be wise now therefore o ye kings be instructed ye judges of the earth
serve the lord with fear and rejoice with trembling
kiss the son lest he be angry and ye perish from the way when his wrath is kindled but a little blessed are all they that put their trust in him
lord how are they increased that trouble me many are they that rise up against me
many there be which say of my soul there is no help for him in god selah
but thou o lord art a shield for me my glory and the lifter up of mine head
i cried unto the lord with my voice and he heard me out of his holy hill selah
i laid me down and slept i awaked for the lord sustained me
i will not be afraid of ten thousands of people that have set themselves against me round about
arise o lord save me o my god for thou hast smitten all mine enemies upon the cheek bone thou hast broken the teeth of the ungodly
salvation belongeth unto the lord thy blessing is upon thy people selah
hear me when i call o god of my righteousness thou hast enlarged me when i was in distress have mercy upon me and hear my prayer
o ye sons of men how long will ye turn my glory into shame how long will ye love vanity and seek after leasing selah
but know that the lord hath set apart him that is godly for himself the lord will hear when i call unto him
stand in awe and sin not commune with your own heart upon your bed and be still selah
offer the sacrifices of righteousness and put your trust in the lord
there be many that say who will shew us any good lord lift thou up the light of thy countenance upon us
thou hast put gladness in my heart more than in the time that their corn and their wine increased
i will both lay me down in peace and sleep for thou lord only makest me dwell in safety
give ear to my words o lord consider my meditation
hearken unto the voice of my cry my king and my god for unto thee will i pray
my voice shalt thou hear in the morning o lord in the morning will i direct my prayer unto thee and will look up
for thou art not a god that hath pleasure in wickedness neither shall evil dwell with thee
the foolish shall not stand in thy sight thou hatest all workers of iniquity
thou shalt destroy them that speak leasing the lord will abhor the bloody and deceitful man
but as for me i will come into thy house in the multitude of thy mercy and in thy fear will i worship toward thy holy temple
lead me o lord in thy righteousness because of mine enemies make thy way straight before my face
for there is no faithfulness in their mouth their inward part is very wickedness their throat is an open sepulchre they flatter with their tongue
destroy thou them o god let them fall by their own counsels cast them out in the multitude of their transgressions for they have rebelled against thee
but let all those that put their trust in thee rejoice let them ever shout for joy because thou defendest them let them also that love thy name be joyful in thee
for thou lord wilt bless the righteous with favour wilt thou compass him as with a shield
o lord rebuke me not in thine anger neither chasten me in thy hot displeasure
have mercy upon me o lord for i am weak o lord heal me for my bones are vexed
my soul is also sore vexed but thou o lord how long
return o lord deliver my soul oh save me for thy mercies sake
for in death there is no remembrance of thee in the grave who shall give thee thanks
i am weary with my groaning all the night make i my bed to swim i water my couch with my tears
mine eye is consumed because of grief it waxeth old because of all mine enemies
depart from me all ye workers of iniquity for the lord hath heard the voice of my weeping
the lord hath heard my supplication the lord will receive my prayer
let all mine enemies be ashamed and sore vexed let them return and be ashamed suddenly
o lord my god in thee do i put my trust save me from all them that persecute me and deliver me
lest he tear my soul like a lion rending it in pieces while there is none to deliver
