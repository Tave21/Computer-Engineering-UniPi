1jn319 and hereby we know that we are of the truth and shall assure our hearts before him
1jn320 for if our heart condemn us god is greater than our heart and knoweth all things
1jn321 beloved if our heart condemn us not then have we confidence toward god
1jn322 and whatsoever we ask we receive of him because we keep his commandments and do those things that are pleasing in his sight
1jn323 and this is his commandment that we should believe on the name of his son jesus christ and love one another as he gave us commandment
1jn324 and he that keepeth his commandments dwelleth in him and he in him and hereby we know that he abideth in us by the spirit which he hath given us
1jn41 beloved believe not every spirit but try the spirits whether they are of god because many false prophets are gone out into the world
1jn42 hereby know ye the spirit of god every spirit that confesseth that jesus christ is come in the flesh is of god
1jn43 and every spirit that confesseth not that jesus christ is come in the flesh is not of god and this is that spirit of antichrist whereof ye have heard that it should come and even now already is it in the world
1jn44 ye are of god little children and have overcome them because greater is he that is in you than he that is in the world
1jn45 they are of the world therefore speak they of the world and the world heareth them
1jn46 we are of god he that knoweth god heareth us he that is not of god heareth not us hereby know we the spirit of truth and the spirit of error
1jn47 beloved let us love one another for love is of god and every one that loveth is born of god and knoweth god
1jn48 he that loveth not knoweth not god for god is love
1jn49 in this was manifested the love of god toward us because that god sent his only begotten son into the world that we might live through him
1jn410 herein is love not that we loved god but that he loved us and sent his son to be the propitiation for our sins
1jn411 beloved if god so loved us we ought also to love one another
1jn412 no man hath seen god at any time if we love one another god dwelleth in us and his love is perfected in us
1jn413 hereby know we that we dwell in him and he in us because he hath given us of his spirit
1jn414 and we have seen and do testify that the father sent the son to be the saviour of the world
1jn415 whosoever shall confess that jesus is the son of god god dwelleth in him and he in god
1jn416 and we have known and believed the love that god hath to us god is love and he that dwelleth in love dwelleth in god and god in him
1jn417 herein is our love made perfect that we may have boldness in the day of judgment because as he is so are we in this world
1jn418 there is no fear in love but perfect love casteth out fear because fear hath torment he that feareth is not made perfect in love
1jn419 we love him because he first loved us
1jn420 if a man say i love god and hateth his brother he is a liar for he that loveth not his brother whom he hath seen how can he love god whom he hath not seen
1jn421 and this commandment have we from him that he who loveth god love his brother also
1jn51 whosoever believeth that jesus is the christ is born of god and every one that loveth him that begat loveth him also that is begotten of him
1jn52 by this we know that we love the children of god when we love god and keep his commandments
1jn53 for this is the love of god that we keep his commandments and his commandments are not grievous
1jn54 for whatsoever is born of god overcometh the world and this is the victory that overcometh the world even our faith
1jn55 who is he that overcometh the world but he that believeth that jesus is the son of god
1jn56 this is he that came by water and blood even jesus christ not by water only but by water and blood and it is the spirit that beareth witness because the spirit is truth
1jn57 for there are three that bear record in heaven the father the word and the holy ghost and these three are one
1jn58 and there are three that bear witness in earth the spirit and the water and the blood and these three agree in one
1jn59 if we receive the witness of men the witness of god is greater for this is the witness of god which he hath testified of his son
1jn510 he that believeth on the son of god hath the witness in himself he that believeth not god hath made him a liar because he believeth not the record that god gave of his son
1jn511 and this is the record that god hath given to us eternal life and this life is in his son
1jn512 he that hath the son hath life and he that hath not the son of god hath not life
1jn513 these things have i written unto you that believe on the name of the son of god that ye may know that ye have eternal life and that ye may believe on the name of the son of god
1jn514 and this is the confidence that we have in him that if we ask any thing according to his will he heareth us
1jn515 and if we know that he hear us whatsoever we ask we know that we have the petitions that we desired of him
1jn516 if any man see his brother sin a sin which is not unto death he shall ask and he shall give him life for them that sin not unto death there is a sin unto death i do not say that he shall pray for it
1jn517 all unrighteousness is sin and there is a sin not unto death
1jn518 we know that whosoever is born of god sinneth not but he that is begotten of god keepeth himself and that wicked one toucheth him not
1jn519 and we know that we are of god and the whole world lieth in wickedness
1jn520 and we know that the son of god is come and hath given us an understanding that we may know him that is true and we are in him that is true even in his son jesus christ this is the true god and eternal life
1jn521 little children keep yourselves from idols amen
2jn11 the elder unto the elect lady and her children whom i love in the truth and not i only but also all they that have known the truth
2jn12 for the truth's sake which dwelleth in us and shall be with us for ever
2jn13 grace be with you mercy and peace from god the father and from the lord jesus christ the son of the father in truth and love
2jn14 i rejoiced greatly that i found of thy children walking in truth as we have received a commandment from the father
2jn15 and now i beseech thee lady not as though i wrote a new commandment unto thee but that which we had from the beginning that we love one another
2jn16 and this is love that we walk after his commandments this is the commandment that as ye have heard from the beginning ye should walk in it
2jn17 for many deceivers are entered into the world who confess not that jesus christ is come in the flesh this is a deceiver and an antichrist
2jn18 look to yourselves that we lose not those things which we have wrought but that we receive a full reward
2jn19 whosoever transgresseth and abideth not in the doctrine of christ hath not god he that abideth in the doctrine of christ he hath both the father and the son
2jn110 if there come any unto you and bring not this doctrine receive him not into your house neither bid him god speed
2jn111 for he that biddeth him god speed is partaker of his evil deeds
2jn112 having many things to write unto you i would not write with paper and ink but i trust to come unto you and speak face to face that our joy may be full
2jn113 the children of thy elect sister greet thee amen
3jn11 the elder unto the wellbeloved gaius whom i love in the truth
3jn12 beloved i wish above all things that thou mayest prosper and be in health even as thy soul prospereth
3jn13 for i rejoiced greatly when the brethren came and testified of the truth that is in thee even as thou walkest in the truth
3jn14 i have no greater joy than to hear that my children walk in truth
3jn15 beloved thou doest faithfully whatsoever thou doest to the brethren and to strangers
3jn16 which have borne witness of thy charity before the church whom if thou bring forward on their journey after a godly sort thou shalt do well
3jn17 because that for his name's sake they went forth taking nothing of the gentiles
3jn18 we therefore ought to receive such that we might be fellowhelpers to the truth
3jn19 i wrote unto the church but diotrephes who loveth to have the preeminence among them receiveth us not
3jn110 wherefore if i come i will remember his deeds which he doeth prating against us with malicious words and not content therewith neither doth he himself receive the brethren and forbiddeth them that would and casteth them out of the church
3jn111 beloved follow not that which is evil but that which is good he that doeth good is of god but he that doeth evil hath not seen god
3jn112 demetrius hath good report of all men and of the truth itself yea and we also bear record and ye know that our record is true
3jn113 i had many things to write but i will not with ink and pen write unto thee
3jn114 but i trust i shall shortly see thee and we shall speak face to face peace be to thee our friends salute thee greet the friends by name
jude the servant of jesus christ and brother of james to them that are sanctified by god the father and preserved in jesus christ and called
mercy unto you and peace and love be multiplied
beloved when i gave all diligence to write unto you of the common salvation it was needful for me to write unto you and exhort you that ye should earnestly contend for the faith which was once delivered unto the saints
for there are certain men crept in unawares who were before of old ordained to this condemnation ungodly men turning the grace of our god into lasciviousness and denying the only lord god and our lord jesus christ
i will therefore put you in remembrance though ye once knew this how that the lord having saved the people out of the land of egypt afterward destroyed them that believed not
and the angels which kept not their first estate but left their own habitation he hath reserved in everlasting chains under darkness unto the judgment of the great day
even as sodom and gomorrha and the cities about them in like manner giving themselves over to fornication and going after strange flesh are set forth for an example suffering the vengeance of eternal fire
likewise also these filthy dreamers defile the flesh despise dominion and speak evil of dignities
yet michael the archangel when contending with the devil he disputed about the body of moses durst not bring against him a railing accusation but said the lord rebuke thee
but these speak evil of those things which they know not but what they know naturally as brute beasts in those things they corrupt themselves
woe unto them for they have gone in the way of cain and ran greedily after the error of balaam for reward and perished in the gainsaying of core
these are spots in your feasts of charity when they feast with you feeding themselves without fear clouds they are without water carried about of winds trees whose fruit withereth without fruit twice dead plucked up by the roots
raging waves of the sea foaming out their own shame wandering stars to whom is reserved the blackness of darkness for ever
and enoch also the seventh from adam prophesied of these saying behold the lord cometh with ten thousands of his saints
to execute judgment upon all and to convince all that are ungodly among them of all their ungodly deeds which they have ungodly committed and of all their hard speeches which ungodly sinners have spoken against him
these are murmurers complainers walking after their own lusts and their mouth speaketh great swelling words having men's persons in admiration because of advantage
but beloved remember ye the words which were spoken before of the apostles of our lord jesus christ
how that they told you there should be mockers in the last time who should walk after their own ungodly lusts
these be they who separate themselves sensual having not the spirit
but ye beloved building up yourselves on your most holy faith praying in the holy ghost
keep yourselves in the love of god looking for the mercy of our lord jesus christ unto eternal life
and of some have compassion making a difference
and others save with fear pulling them out of the fire hating even the garment spotted by the flesh
now unto him that is able to keep you from falling and to present you faultless before the presence of his glory with exceeding joy
to the only wise god our saviour be glory and majesty dominion and power both now and ever amen
the revelation of jesus christ which god gave unto him to shew unto his servants things which must shortly come to pass and he sent and signified it by his angel unto his servant john
who bare record of the word of god and of the testimony of jesus christ and of all things that he saw
blessed is he that readeth and they that hear the words of this prophecy and keep those things which are written therein for the time is at hand
john to the seven churches which are in asia grace be unto you and peace from him which is and which was and which is to come and from the seven spirits which are before his throne
and from jesus christ who is the faithful witness and the first begotten of the dead and the prince of the kings of the earth unto him that loved us and washed us from our sins in his own blood
and hath made us kings and priests unto god and his father to him be glory and dominion for ever and ever amen
behold he cometh with clouds and every eye shall see him and they also which pierced him and all kindreds of the earth shall wail because of him even so amen
i am alpha and omega the beginning and the ending saith the lord which is and which was and which is to come the almighty
i john who also am your brother and companion in tribulation and in the kingdom and patience of jesus christ was in the isle that is called patmos for the word of god and for the testimony of jesus christ
i was in the spirit on the lord's day and heard behind me a great voice as of a trumpet
saying i am alpha and omega the first and the last and what thou seest write in a book and send it unto the seven churches which are in asia unto ephesus and unto smyrna and unto pergamos and unto thyatira and unto sardis and unto philadelphia and unto laodicea
and i turned to see the voice that spake with me and being turned i saw seven golden candlesticks
and in the midst of the seven candlesticks one like unto the son of man clothed with a garment down to the foot and girt about the paps with a golden girdle
his head and his hairs were white like wool as white as snow and his eyes were as a flame of fire
and his feet like unto fine brass as if they burned in a furnace and his voice as the sound of many waters
and he had in his right hand seven stars and out of his mouth went a sharp twoedged sword and his countenance was as the sun shineth in his strength
and when i saw him i fell at his feet as dead and he laid his right hand upon me saying unto me fear not i am the first and the last
i am he that liveth and was dead and behold i am alive for evermore amen and have the keys of hell and of death
write the things which thou hast seen and the things which are and the things which shall be hereafter
the mystery of the seven stars which thou sawest in my right hand and the seven golden candlesticks the seven stars are the angels of the seven churches and the seven candlesticks which thou sawest are the seven churches
unto the angel of the church of ephesus write these things saith he that holdeth the seven stars in his right hand who walketh in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks
i know thy works and thy labour and thy patience and how thou canst not bear them which are evil and thou hast tried them which say they are apostles and are not and hast found them liars
and hast borne and hast patience and for my name's sake hast laboured and hast not fainted
nevertheless i have somewhat against thee because thou hast left thy first love
remember therefore from whence thou art fallen and repent and do the first works or else i will come unto thee quickly and will remove thy candlestick out of his place except thou repent
but this thou hast that thou hatest the deeds of the nicolaitanes which i also hate
he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit saith unto the churches to him that overcometh will i give to eat of the tree of life which is in the midst of the paradise of god
and unto the angel of the church in smyrna write these things saith the first and the last which was dead and is alive
i know thy works and tribulation and poverty but thou art rich and i know the blasphemy of them which say they are jews and are not but are the synagogue of satan
fear none of those things which thou shalt suffer behold the devil shall cast some of you into prison that ye may be tried and ye shall have tribulation ten days be thou faithful unto death and i will give thee a crown of life
he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit saith unto the churches he that overcometh shall not be hurt of the second death
and to the angel of the church in pergamos write these things saith he which hath the sharp sword with two edges
i know thy works and where thou dwellest even where satan's seat is and thou holdest fast my name and hast not denied my faith even in those days wherein antipas was my faithful martyr who was slain among you where satan dwelleth
but i have a few things against thee because thou hast there them that hold the doctrine of balaam who taught balac to cast a stumblingblock before the children of israel to eat things sacrificed unto idols and to commit fornication
so hast thou also them that hold the doctrine of the nicolaitanes which thing i hate
repent or else i will come unto thee quickly and will fight against them with the sword of my mouth
he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit saith unto the churches to him that overcometh will i give to eat of the hidden manna and will give him a white stone and in the stone a new name written which no man knoweth saving he that receiveth it
and unto the angel of the church in thyatira write these things saith the son of god who hath his eyes like unto a flame of fire and his feet are like fine brass
i know thy works and charity and service and faith and thy patience and thy works and the last to be more than the first
notwithstanding i have a few things against thee because thou sufferest that woman jezebel which calleth herself a prophetess to teach and to seduce my servants to commit fornication and to eat things sacrificed unto idols
and i gave her space to repent of her fornication and she repented not
behold i will cast her into a bed and them that commit adultery with her into great tribulation except they repent of their deeds
and i will kill her children with death and all the churches shall know that i am he which searcheth the reins and hearts and i will give unto every one of you according to your works
but unto you i say and unto the rest in thyatira as many as have not this doctrine and which have not known the depths of satan as they speak i will put upon you none other burden
but that which ye have already hold fast till i come
and he that overcometh and keepeth my works unto the end to him will i give power over the nations
and he shall rule them with a rod of iron as the vessels of a potter shall they be broken to shivers even as i received of my father
and i will give him the morning star
he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit saith unto the churches
and unto the angel of the church in sardis write these things saith he that hath the seven spirits of god and the seven stars i know thy works that thou hast a name that thou livest and art dead
be watchful and strengthen the things which remain that are ready to die for i have not found thy works perfect before god
remember therefore how thou hast received and heard and hold fast and repent if therefore thou shalt not watch i will come on thee as a thief and thou shalt not know what hour i will come upon thee
thou hast a few names even in sardis which have not defiled their garments and they shall walk with me in white for they are worthy
he that overcometh the same shall be clothed in white raiment and i will not blot out his name out of the book of life but i will confess his name before my father and before his angels
he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit saith unto the churches
and to the angel of the church in philadelphia write these things saith he that is holy he that is true he that hath the key of david he that openeth and no man shutteth and shutteth and no man openeth
i know thy works behold i have set before thee an open door and no man can shut it for thou hast a little strength and hast kept my word and hast not denied my name
behold i will make them of the synagogue of satan which say they are jews and are not but do lie behold i will make them to come and worship before thy feet and to know that i have loved thee
because thou hast kept the word of my patience i also will keep thee from the hour of temptation which shall come upon all the world to try them that dwell upon the earth
behold i come quickly hold that fast which thou hast that no man take thy crown
him that overcometh will i make a pillar in the temple of my god and he shall go no more out and i will write upon him the name of my god and the name of the city of my god which is new jerusalem which cometh down out of heaven from my god and i will write upon him my new name
he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit saith unto the churches
and unto the angel of the church of the laodiceans write these things saith the amen the faithful and true witness the beginning of the creation of god
i know thy works that thou art neither cold nor hot i would thou wert cold or hot
so then because thou art lukewarm and neither cold nor hot i will spue thee out of my mouth
because thou sayest i am rich and increased with goods and have need of nothing and knowest not that thou art wretched and miserable and poor and blind and naked
i counsel thee to buy of me gold tried in the fire that thou mayest be rich and white raiment that thou mayest be clothed and that the shame of thy nakedness do not appear and anoint thine eyes with eyesalve that thou mayest see
as many as i love i rebuke and chasten be zealous therefore and repent
behold i stand at the door and knock if any man hear my voice and open the door i will come in to him and will sup with him and he with me
to him that overcometh will i grant to sit with me in my throne even as i also overcame and am set down with my father in his throne
he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit saith unto the churches
after this i looked and behold a door was opened in heaven and the first voice which i heard was as it were of a trumpet talking with me which said come up hither and i will shew thee things which must be hereafter
and immediately i was in the spirit and behold a throne was set in heaven and one sat on the throne
and he that sat was to look upon like a jasper and a sardine stone and there was a rainbow round about the throne in sight like unto an emerald
and round about the throne were four and twenty seats and upon the seats i saw four and twenty elders sitting clothed in white raiment and they had on their heads crowns of gold
and out of the throne proceeded lightnings and thunderings and voices and there were seven lamps of fire burning before the throne which are the seven spirits of god
and before the throne there was a sea of glass like unto crystal and in the midst of the throne and round about the throne were four beasts full of eyes before and behind
and the first beast was like a lion and the second beast like a calf and the third beast had a face as a man and the fourth beast was like a flying eagle
and the four beasts had each of them six wings about him and they were full of eyes within and they rest not day and night saying holy holy holy lord god almighty which was and is and is to come
and when those beasts give glory and honour and thanks to him that sat on the throne who liveth for ever and ever
the four and twenty elders fall down before him that sat on the throne and worship him that liveth for ever and ever and cast their crowns before the throne saying
thou art worthy o lord to receive glory and honour and power for thou hast created all things and for thy pleasure they are and were created
and i saw in the right hand of him that sat on the throne a book written within and on the backside sealed with seven seals
and i saw a strong angel proclaiming with a loud voice who is worthy to open the book and to loose the seals thereof
and no man in heaven nor in earth neither under the earth was able to open the book neither to look thereon
and i wept much because no man was found worthy to open and to read the book neither to look thereon
and one of the elders saith unto me weep not behold the lion of the tribe of juda the root of david hath prevailed to open the book and to loose the seven seals thereof
and i beheld and lo in the midst of the throne and of the four beasts and in the midst of the elders stood a lamb as it had been slain having seven horns and seven eyes which are the seven spirits of god sent forth into all the earth
and he came and took the book out of the right hand of him that sat upon the throne
and when he had taken the book the four beasts and four and twenty elders fell down before the lamb having every one of them harps and golden vials full of odours which are the prayers of saints
and they sung a new song saying thou art worthy to take the book and to open the seals thereof for thou wast slain and hast redeemed us to god by thy blood out of every kindred and tongue and people and nation
and hast made us unto our god kings and priests and we shall reign on the earth
and i beheld and i heard the voice of many angels round about the throne and the beasts and the elders and the number of them was ten thousand times ten thousand and thousands of thousands
saying with a loud voice worthy is the lamb that was slain to receive power and riches and wisdom and strength and honour and glory and blessing
and every creature which is in heaven and on the earth and under the earth and such as are in the sea and all that are in them heard i saying blessing and honour and glory and power be unto him that sitteth upon the throne and unto the lamb for ever and ever
and the four beasts said amen and the four and twenty elders fell down and worshipped him that liveth for ever and ever
and i saw when the lamb opened one of the seals and i heard as it were the noise of thunder one of the four beasts saying come and see
and i saw and behold a white horse and he that sat on him had a bow and a crown was given unto him and he went forth conquering and to conquer
and when he had opened the second seal i heard the second beast say come and see
and there went out another horse that was red and power was given to him that sat thereon to take peace from the earth and that they should kill one another and there was given unto him a great sword
