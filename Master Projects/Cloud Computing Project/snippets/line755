act iii
scene iv langley the duke of york's garden
 enter the queen and two ladies
queen what sport shall we devise here in this garden
 to drive away the heavy thought of care
lady madam we'll play at bowls
queen twill make me think the world is full of rubs
 and that my fortune rubs against the bias
lady madam we'll dance
queen my legs can keep no measure in delight
 when my poor heart no measure keeps in grief
 therefore no dancing girl some other sport
lady madam we'll tell tales
queen of sorrow or of joy
lady of either madam
queen of neither girl
 for of joy being altogether wanting
 it doth remember me the more of sorrow
 or if of grief being altogether had
 it adds more sorrow to my want of joy
 for what i have i need not to repeat
 and what i want it boots not to complain
lady madam i'll sing
queen tis well that thou hast cause
 but thou shouldst please me better wouldst thou weep
lady i could weep madam would it do you good
queen and i could sing would weeping do me good
 and never borrow any tear of thee
 enter a gardener and two servants
 but stay here come the gardeners
 let's step into the shadow of these trees
 my wretchedness unto a row of pins
 they'll talk of state for every one doth so
 against a change woe is forerun with woe
 queen and ladies retire
gardener go bind thou up yon dangling apricocks
 which like unruly children make their sire
 stoop with oppression of their prodigal weight
 give some supportance to the bending twigs
 go thou and like an executioner
 cut off the heads of too fast growing sprays
 that look too lofty in our commonwealth
 all must be even in our government
 you thus employ'd i will go root away
 the noisome weeds which without profit suck
 the soil's fertility from wholesome flowers
servant why should we in the compass of a pale
 keep law and form and due proportion
 showing as in a model our firm estate
 when our seawalled garden the whole land
 is full of weeds her fairest flowers choked up
 her fruittrees all upturned her hedges ruin'd
 her knots disorder'd and her wholesome herbs
 swarming with caterpillars
gardener hold thy peace
 he that hath suffer'd this disorder'd spring
 hath now himself met with the fall of leaf
 the weeds which his broadspreading leaves did shelter
 that seem'd in eating him to hold him up
 are pluck'd up root and all by bolingbroke
 i mean the earl of wiltshire bushy green
servant what are they dead
gardener they are and bolingbroke
 hath seized the wasteful king o what pity is it
 that he had not so trimm'd and dress'd his land
 as we this garden we at time of year
 do wound the bark the skin of our fruittrees
 lest being overproud in sap and blood
 with too much riches it confound itself
 had he done so to great and growing men
 they might have lived to bear and he to taste
 their fruits of duty superfluous branches
 we lop away that bearing boughs may live
 had he done so himself had borne the crown
 which waste of idle hours hath quite thrown down
servant what think you then the king shall be deposed
gardener depress'd he is already and deposed
 tis doubt he will be letters came last night
 to a dear friend of the good duke of york's
 that tell black tidings
queen o i am press'd to death through want of speaking
 coming forward
 thou old adam's likeness set to dress this garden
 how dares thy harsh rude tongue sound this unpleasing news
 what eve what serpent hath suggested thee
 to make a second fall of cursed man
 why dost thou say king richard is deposed
 darest thou thou little better thing than earth
 divine his downfall say where when and how
 camest thou by this ill tidings speak thou wretch
gardener pardon me madam little joy have i
 to breathe this news yet what i say is true
 king richard he is in the mighty hold
 of bolingbroke their fortunes both are weigh'd
 in your lord's scale is nothing but himself
 and some few vanities that make him light
 but in the balance of great bolingbroke
 besides himself are all the english peers
 and with that odds he weighs king richard down
 post you to london and you will find it so
 i speak no more than every one doth know
queen nimble mischance that art so light of foot
 doth not thy embassage belong to me
 and am i last that knows it o thou think'st
 to serve me last that i may longest keep
 thy sorrow in my breast come ladies go
 to meet at london london's king in woe
 what was i born to this that my sad look
 should grace the triumph of great bolingbroke
 gardener for telling me these news of woe
 pray god the plants thou graft'st may never grow
 exeunt queen and ladies
gardener poor queen so that thy state might be no worse
 i would my skill were subject to thy curse
 here did she fall a tear here in this place
 i'll set a bank of rue sour herb of grace
 rue even for ruth here shortly shall be seen
 in the remembrance of a weeping queen
 exeunt
 king richard ii
act iv
scene i westminster hall
 enter as to the parliament henry bolingbroke
 duke of aumerle northumberland henry percy lord
 fitzwater duke of surrey the bishop of carlisle
 the abbot of westminster and another lord herald
 officers and bagot
henry bolingbroke call forth bagot
 now bagot freely speak thy mind
 what thou dost know of noble gloucester's death
 who wrought it with the king and who perform'd
 the bloody office of his timeless end
bagot then set before my face the lord aumerle
henry bolingbroke cousin stand forth and look upon that man
bagot my lord aumerle i know your daring tongue
 scorns to unsay what once it hath deliver'd
 in that dead time when gloucester's death was plotted
 i heard you say is not my arm of length
 that reacheth from the restful english court
 as far as calais to mine uncle's head'
 amongst much other talk that very time
 i heard you say that you had rather refuse
 the offer of an hundred thousand crowns
 than bolingbroke's return to england
 adding withal how blest this land would be
 in this your cousin's death
duke of aumerle princes and noble lords
 what answer shall i make to this base man
 shall i so much dishonour my fair stars
 on equal terms to give him chastisement
 either i must or have mine honour soil'd
 with the attainder of his slanderous lips
 there is my gage the manual seal of death
 that marks thee out for hell i say thou liest
 and will maintain what thou hast said is false
 in thy heartblood though being all too base
 to stain the temper of my knightly sword
henry bolingbroke bagot forbear thou shalt not take it up
duke of aumerle excepting one i would he were the best
 in all this presence that hath moved me so
lord fitzwater if that thy valour stand on sympathy
 there is my gage aumerle in gage to thine
 by that fair sun which shows me where thou stand'st
 i heard thee say and vauntingly thou spakest it
 that thou wert cause of noble gloucester's death
 if thou deny'st it twenty times thou liest
 and i will turn thy falsehood to thy heart
 where it was forged with my rapier's point
duke of aumerle thou darest not coward live to see that day
lord fitzwater now by my soul i would it were this hour
duke of aumerle fitzwater thou art damn'd to hell for this
henry percy aumerle thou liest his honour is as true
 in this appeal as thou art all unjust
 and that thou art so there i throw my gage
 to prove it on thee to the extremest point
 of mortal breathing seize it if thou darest
duke of aumerle an if i do not may my hands rot off
 and never brandish more revengeful steel
 over the glittering helmet of my foe
lord i task the earth to the like forsworn aumerle
 and spur thee on with full as many lies
 as may be holloa'd in thy treacherous ear
