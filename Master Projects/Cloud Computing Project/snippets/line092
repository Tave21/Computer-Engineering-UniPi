behold i will bring again the shadow of the degrees which is gone down in the sun dial of ahaz ten degrees backward so the sun returned ten degrees by which degrees it was gone down
the writing of hezekiah king of judah when he had been sick and was recovered of his sickness
i said in the cutting off of my days i shall go to the gates of the grave i am deprived of the residue of my years
i said i shall not see the lord even the lord in the land of the living i shall behold man no more with the inhabitants of the world
mine age is departed and is removed from me as a shepherd's tent i have cut off like a weaver my life he will cut me off with pining sickness from day even to night wilt thou make an end of me
i reckoned till morning that as a lion so will he break all my bones from day even to night wilt thou make an end of me
like a crane or a swallow so did i chatter i did mourn as a dove mine eyes fail with looking upward o lord i am oppressed undertake for me
what shall i say he hath both spoken unto me and himself hath done it i shall go softly all my years in the bitterness of my soul
o lord by these things men live and in all these things is the life of my spirit so wilt thou recover me and make me to live
behold for peace i had great bitterness but thou hast in love to my soul delivered it from the pit of corruption for thou hast cast all my sins behind thy back
for the grave cannot praise thee death can not celebrate thee they that go down into the pit cannot hope for thy truth
the living the living he shall praise thee as i do this day the father to the children shall make known thy truth
the lord was ready to save me therefore we will sing my songs to the stringed instruments all the days of our life in the house of the lord
for isaiah had said let them take a lump of figs and lay it for a plaister upon the boil and he shall recover
hezekiah also had said what is the sign that i shall go up to the house of the lord
at that time merodachbaladan the son of baladan king of babylon sent letters and a present to hezekiah for he had heard that he had been sick and was recovered
and hezekiah was glad of them and shewed them the house of his precious things the silver and the gold and the spices and the precious ointment and all the house of his armour and all that was found in his treasures there was nothing in his house nor in all his dominion that hezekiah shewed them not
then came isaiah the prophet unto king hezekiah and said unto him what said these men and from whence came they unto thee and hezekiah said they are come from a far country unto me even from babylon
then said he what have they seen in thine house and hezekiah answered all that is in mine house have they seen there is nothing among my treasures that i have not shewed them
then said isaiah to hezekiah hear the word of the lord of hosts
behold the days come that all that is in thine house and that which thy fathers have laid up in store until this day shall be carried to babylon nothing shall be left saith the lord
and of thy sons that shall issue from thee which thou shalt beget shall they take away and they shall be eunuchs in the palace of the king of babylon
then said hezekiah to isaiah good is the word of the lord which thou hast spoken he said moreover for there shall be peace and truth in my days
comfort ye comfort ye my people saith your god
speak ye comfortably to jerusalem and cry unto her that her warfare is accomplished that her iniquity is pardoned for she hath received of the lord's hand double for all her sins
the voice of him that crieth in the wilderness prepare ye the way of the lord make straight in the desert a highway for our god
every valley shall be exalted and every mountain and hill shall be made low and the crooked shall be made straight and the rough places plain
and the glory of the lord shall be revealed and all flesh shall see it together for the mouth of the lord hath spoken it
the voice said cry and he said what shall i cry all flesh is grass and all the goodliness thereof is as the flower of the field
the grass withereth the flower fadeth because the spirit of the lord bloweth upon it surely the people is grass
the grass withereth the flower fadeth but the word of our god shall stand for ever
o zion that bringest good tidings get thee up into the high mountain o jerusalem that bringest good tidings lift up thy voice with strength lift it up be not afraid say unto the cities of judah behold your god
behold the lord god will come with strong hand and his arm shall rule for him behold his reward is with him and his work before him
he shall feed his flock like a shepherd he shall gather the lambs with his arm and carry them in his bosom and shall gently lead those that are with young
who hath measured the waters in the hollow of his hand and meted out heaven with the span and comprehended the dust of the earth in a measure and weighed the mountains in scales and the hills in a balance
who hath directed the spirit of the lord or being his counsellor hath taught him
with whom took he counsel and who instructed him and taught him in the path of judgment and taught him knowledge and shewed to him the way of understanding
behold the nations are as a drop of a bucket and are counted as the small dust of the balance behold he taketh up the isles as a very little thing
and lebanon is not sufficient to burn nor the beasts thereof sufficient for a burnt offering
all nations before him are as nothing and they are counted to him less than nothing and vanity
to whom then will ye liken god or what likeness will ye compare unto him
the workman melteth a graven image and the goldsmith spreadeth it over with gold and casteth silver chains
he that is so impoverished that he hath no oblation chooseth a tree that will not rot he seeketh unto him a cunning workman to prepare a graven image that shall not be moved
have ye not known have ye not heard hath it not been told you from the beginning have ye not understood from the foundations of the earth
it is he that sitteth upon the circle of the earth and the inhabitants thereof are as grasshoppers that stretcheth out the heavens as a curtain and spreadeth them out as a tent to dwell in
that bringeth the princes to nothing he maketh the judges of the earth as vanity
yea they shall not be planted yea they shall not be sown yea their stock shall not take root in the earth and he shall also blow upon them and they shall wither and the whirlwind shall take them away as stubble
to whom then will ye liken me or shall i be equal saith the holy one
lift up your eyes on high and behold who hath created these things that bringeth out their host by number he calleth them all by names by the greatness of his might for that he is strong in power not one faileth
why sayest thou o jacob and speakest o israel my way is hid from the lord and my judgment is passed over from my god
hast thou not known hast thou not heard that the everlasting god the lord the creator of the ends of the earth fainteth not neither is weary there is no searching of his understanding
he giveth power to the faint and to them that have no might he increaseth strength
even the youths shall faint and be weary and the young men shall utterly fall
but they that wait upon the lord shall renew their strength they shall mount up with wings as eagles they shall run and not be weary and they shall walk and not faint
keep silence before me o islands and let the people renew their strength let them come near then let them speak let us come near together to judgment
who raised up the righteous man from the east called him to his foot gave the nations before him and made him rule over kings he gave them as the dust to his sword and as driven stubble to his bow
he pursued them and passed safely even by the way that he had not gone with his feet
who hath wrought and done it calling the generations from the beginning i the lord the first and with the last i am he
the isles saw it and feared the ends of the earth were afraid drew near and came
they helped every one his neighbour and every one said to his brother be of good courage
so the carpenter encouraged the goldsmith and he that smootheth with the hammer him that smote the anvil saying it is ready for the sodering and he fastened it with nails that it should not be moved
but thou israel art my servant jacob whom i have chosen the seed of abraham my friend
thou whom i have taken from the ends of the earth and called thee from the chief men thereof and said unto thee thou art my servant i have chosen thee and not cast thee away
fear thou not for i am with thee be not dismayed for i am thy god i will strengthen thee yea i will help thee yea i will uphold thee with the right hand of my righteousness
behold all they that were incensed against thee shall be ashamed and confounded they shall be as nothing and they that strive with thee shall perish
thou shalt seek them and shalt not find them even them that contended with thee they that war against thee shall be as nothing and as a thing of nought
for i the lord thy god will hold thy right hand saying unto thee fear not i will help thee
fear not thou worm jacob and ye men of israel i will help thee saith the lord and thy redeemer the holy one of israel
behold i will make thee a new sharp threshing instrument having teeth thou shalt thresh the mountains and beat them small and shalt make the hills as chaff
thou shalt fan them and the wind shall carry them away and the whirlwind shall scatter them and thou shalt rejoice in the lord and shalt glory in the holy one of israel
when the poor and needy seek water and there is none and their tongue faileth for thirst i the lord will hear them i the god of israel will not forsake them
i will open rivers in high places and fountains in the midst of the valleys i will make the wilderness a pool of water and the dry land springs of water
i will plant in the wilderness the cedar the shittah tree and the myrtle and the oil tree i will set in the desert the fir tree and the pine and the box tree together
that they may see and know and consider and understand together that the hand of the lord hath done this and the holy one of israel hath created it
produce your cause saith the lord bring forth your strong reasons saith the king of jacob
let them bring them forth and shew us what shall happen let them shew the former things what they be that we may consider them and know the latter end of them or declare us things for to come
shew the things that are to come hereafter that we may know that ye are gods yea do good or do evil that we may be dismayed and behold it together
behold ye are of nothing and your work of nought an abomination is he that chooseth you
i have raised up one from the north and he shall come from the rising of the sun shall he call upon my name and he shall come upon princes as upon morter and as the potter treadeth clay
who hath declared from the beginning that we may know and beforetime that we may say he is righteous yea there is none that sheweth yea there is none that declareth yea there is none that heareth your words
the first shall say to zion behold behold them and i will give to jerusalem one that bringeth good tidings
for i beheld and there was no man even among them and there was no counsellor that when i asked of them could answer a word
behold they are all vanity their works are nothing their molten images are wind and confusion
behold my servant whom i uphold mine elect in whom my soul delighteth i have put my spirit upon him he shall bring forth judgment to the gentiles
he shall not cry nor lift up nor cause his voice to be heard in the street
a bruised reed shall he not break and the smoking flax shall he not quench he shall bring forth judgment unto truth
he shall not fail nor be discouraged till he have set judgment in the earth and the isles shall wait for his law
thus saith god the lord he that created the heavens and stretched them out he that spread forth the earth and that which cometh out of it he that giveth breath unto the people upon it and spirit to them that walk therein
i the lord have called thee in righteousness and will hold thine hand and will keep thee and give thee for a covenant of the people for a light of the gentiles
to open the blind eyes to bring out the prisoners from the prison and them that sit in darkness out of the prison house
i am the lord that is my name and my glory will i not give to another neither my praise to graven images
behold the former things are come to pass and new things do i declare before they spring forth i tell you of them
sing unto the lord a new song and his praise from the end of the earth ye that go down to the sea and all that is therein the isles and the inhabitants thereof
let the wilderness and the cities thereof lift up their voice the villages that kedar doth inhabit let the inhabitants of the rock sing let them shout from the top of the mountains
let them give glory unto the lord and declare his praise in the islands
the lord shall go forth as a mighty man he shall stir up jealousy like a man of war he shall cry yea roar he shall prevail against his enemies
i have long time holden my peace i have been still and refrained myself now will i cry like a travailing woman i will destroy and devour at once
i will make waste mountains and hills and dry up all their herbs and i will make the rivers islands and i will dry up the pools
and i will bring the blind by a way that they knew not i will lead them in paths that they have not known i will make darkness light before them and crooked things straight these things will i do unto them and not forsake them
they shall be turned back they shall be greatly ashamed that trust in graven images that say to the molten images ye are our gods
hear ye deaf and look ye blind that ye may see
who is blind but my servant or deaf as my messenger that i sent who is blind as he that is perfect and blind as the lord's servant
seeing many things but thou observest not opening the ears but he heareth not
the lord is well pleased for his righteousness sake he will magnify the law and make it honourable
but this is a people robbed and spoiled they are all of them snared in holes and they are hid in prison houses they are for a prey and none delivereth for a spoil and none saith restore
who among you will give ear to this who will hearken and hear for the time to come
who gave jacob for a spoil and israel to the robbers did not the lord he against whom we have sinned for they would not walk in his ways neither were they obedient unto his law
therefore he hath poured upon him the fury of his anger and the strength of battle and it hath set him on fire round about yet he knew not and it burned him yet he laid it not to heart
but now thus saith the lord that created thee o jacob and he that formed thee o israel fear not for i have redeemed thee i have called thee by thy name thou art mine
when thou passest through the waters i will be with thee and through the rivers they shall not overflow thee when thou walkest through the fire thou shalt not be burned neither shall the flame kindle upon thee
for i am the lord thy god the holy one of israel thy saviour i gave egypt for thy ransom ethiopia and seba for thee
since thou wast precious in my sight thou hast been honourable and i have loved thee therefore will i give men for thee and people for thy life
fear not for i am with thee i will bring thy seed from the east and gather thee from the west
i will say to the north give up and to the south keep not back bring my sons from far and my daughters from the ends of the earth
even every one that is called by my name for i have created him for my glory i have formed him yea i have made him
bring forth the blind people that have eyes and the deaf that have ears
let all the nations be gathered together and let the people be assembled who among them can declare this and shew us former things let them bring forth their witnesses that they may be justified or let them hear and say it is truth
ye are my witnesses saith the lord and my servant whom i have chosen that ye may know and believe me and understand that i am he before me there was no god formed neither shall there be after me
i even i am the lord and beside me there is no saviour
i have declared and have saved and i have shewed when there was no strange god among you therefore ye are my witnesses saith the lord that i am god
yea before the day was i am he and there is none that can deliver out of my hand i will work and who shall let it
thus saith the lord your redeemer the holy one of israel for your sake i have sent to babylon and have brought down all their nobles and the chaldeans whose cry is in the ships
i am the lord your holy one the creator of israel your king
thus saith the lord which maketh a way in the sea and a path in the mighty waters
which bringeth forth the chariot and horse the army and the power they shall lie down together they shall not rise they are extinct they are quenched as tow
remember ye not the former things neither consider the things of old
behold i will do a new thing now it shall spring forth shall ye not know it i will even make a way in the wilderness and rivers in the desert
the beast of the field shall honour me the dragons and the owls because i give waters in the wilderness and rivers in the desert to give drink to my people my chosen
this people have i formed for myself they shall shew forth my praise
but thou hast not called upon me o jacob but thou hast been weary of me o israel
thou hast not brought me the small cattle of thy burnt offerings neither hast thou honoured me with thy sacrifices i have not caused thee to serve with an offering nor wearied thee with incense
thou hast bought me no sweet cane with money neither hast thou filled me with the fat of thy sacrifices but thou hast made me to serve with thy sins thou hast wearied me with thine iniquities
i even i am he that blotteth out thy transgressions for mine own sake and will not remember thy sins
put me in remembrance let us plead together declare thou that thou mayest be justified
thy first father hath sinned and thy teachers have transgressed against me
therefore i have profaned the princes of the sanctuary and have given jacob to the curse and israel to reproaches
yet now hear o jacob my servant and israel whom i have chosen
thus saith the lord that made thee and formed thee from the womb which will help thee fear not o jacob my servant and thou jesurun whom i have chosen
for i will pour water upon him that is thirsty and floods upon the dry ground i will pour my spirit upon thy seed and my blessing upon thine offspring
and they shall spring up as among the grass as willows by the water courses
one shall say i am the lord's and another shall call himself by the name of jacob and another shall subscribe with his hand unto the lord and surname himself by the name of israel
thus saith the lord the king of israel and his redeemer the lord of hosts i am the first and i am the last and beside me there is no god
and who as i shall call and shall declare it and set it in order for me since i appointed the ancient people and the things that are coming and shall come let them shew unto them
fear ye not neither be afraid have not i told thee from that time and have declared it ye are even my witnesses is there a god beside me yea there is no god i know not any
they that make a graven image are all of them vanity and their delectable things shall not profit and they are their own witnesses they see not nor know that they may be ashamed
who hath formed a god or molten a graven image that is profitable for nothing
behold all his fellows shall be ashamed and the workmen they are of men let them all be gathered together let them stand up yet they shall fear and they shall be ashamed together
the smith with the tongs both worketh in the coals and fashioneth it with hammers and worketh it with the strength of his arms yea he is hungry and his strength faileth he drinketh no water and is faint
the carpenter stretcheth out his rule he marketh it out with a line he fitteth it with planes and he marketh it out with the compass and maketh it after the figure of a man according to the beauty of a man that it may remain in the house
he heweth him down cedars and taketh the cypress and the oak which he strengtheneth for himself among the trees of the forest he planteth an ash and the rain doth nourish it
then shall it be for a man to burn for he will take thereof and warm himself yea he kindleth it and baketh bread yea he maketh a god and worshippeth it he maketh it a graven image and falleth down thereto
he burneth part thereof in the fire with part thereof he eateth flesh he roasteth roast and is satisfied yea he warmeth himself and saith aha i am warm i have seen the fire
and the residue thereof he maketh a god even his graven image he falleth down unto it and worshippeth it and prayeth unto it and saith deliver me for thou art my god
they have not known nor understood for he hath shut their eyes that they cannot see and their hearts that they cannot understand
and none considereth in his heart neither is there knowledge nor understanding to say i have burned part of it in the fire yea also i have baked bread upon the coals thereof i have roasted flesh and eaten it and shall i make the residue thereof an abomination shall i fall down to the stock of a tree
he feedeth on ashes a deceived heart hath turned him aside that he cannot deliver his soul nor say is there not a lie in my right hand
remember these o jacob and israel for thou art my servant i have formed thee thou art my servant o israel thou shalt not be forgotten of me
i have blotted out as a thick cloud thy transgressions and as a cloud thy sins return unto me for i have redeemed thee
sing o ye heavens for the lord hath done it shout ye lower parts of the earth break forth into singing ye mountains o forest and every tree therein for the lord hath redeemed jacob and glorified himself in israel
thus saith the lord thy redeemer and he that formed thee from the womb i am the lord that maketh all things that stretcheth forth the heavens alone that spreadeth abroad the earth by myself
that frustrateth the tokens of the liars and maketh diviners mad that turneth wise men backward and maketh their knowledge foolish
that confirmeth the word of his servant and performeth the counsel of his messengers that saith to jerusalem thou shalt be inhabited and to the cities of judah ye shall be built and i will raise up the decayed places thereof
that saith to the deep be dry and i will dry up thy rivers
that saith of cyrus he is my shepherd and shall perform all my pleasure even saying to jerusalem thou shalt be built and to the temple thy foundation shall be laid
thus saith the lord to his anointed to cyrus whose right hand i have holden to subdue nations before him and i will loose the loins of kings to open before him the two leaved gates and the gates shall not be shut
i will go before thee and make the crooked places straight i will break in pieces the gates of brass and cut in sunder the bars of iron
and i will give thee the treasures of darkness and hidden riches of secret places that thou mayest know that i the lord which call thee by thy name am the god of israel
for jacob my servant's sake and israel mine elect i have even called thee by thy name i have surnamed thee though thou hast not known me
i am the lord and there is none else there is no god beside me i girded thee though thou hast not known me
that they may know from the rising of the sun and from the west that there is none beside me i am the lord and there is none else
i form the light and create darkness i make peace and create evil i the lord do all these things
drop down ye heavens from above and let the skies pour down righteousness let the earth open and let them bring forth salvation and let righteousness spring up together i the lord have created it
woe unto him that striveth with his maker let the potsherd strive with the potsherds of the earth shall the clay say to him that fashioneth it what makest thou or thy work he hath no hands
woe unto him that saith unto his father what begettest thou or to the woman what hast thou brought forth
thus saith the lord the holy one of israel and his maker ask me of things to come concerning my sons and concerning the work of my hands command ye me
i have made the earth and created man upon it i even my hands have stretched out the heavens and all their host have i commanded
i have raised him up in righteousness and i will direct all his ways he shall build my city and he shall let go my captives not for price nor reward saith the lord of hosts
thus saith the lord the labour of egypt and merchandise of ethiopia and of the sabeans men of stature shall come over unto thee and they shall be thine they shall come after thee in chains they shall come over and they shall fall down unto thee they shall make supplication unto thee saying surely god is in thee and there is none else there is no god
verily thou art a god that hidest thyself o god of israel the saviour
they shall be ashamed and also confounded all of them they shall go to confusion together that are makers of idols
but israel shall be saved in the lord with an everlasting salvation ye shall not be ashamed nor confounded world without end
for thus saith the lord that created the heavens god himself that formed the earth and made it he hath established it he created it not in vain he formed it to be inhabited i am the lord and there is none else
i have not spoken in secret in a dark place of the earth i said not unto the seed of jacob seek ye me in vain i the lord speak righteousness i declare things that are right
assemble yourselves and come draw near together ye that are escaped of the nations they have no knowledge that set up the wood of their graven image and pray unto a god that cannot save
tell ye and bring them near yea let them take counsel together who hath declared this from ancient time who hath told it from that time have not i the lord and there is no god else beside me a just god and a saviour there is none beside me
look unto me and be ye saved all the ends of the earth for i am god and there is none else
i have sworn by myself the word is gone out of my mouth in righteousness and shall not return that unto me every knee shall bow every tongue shall swear
surely shall one say in the lord have i righteousness and strength even to him shall men come and all that are incensed against him shall be ashamed
in the lord shall all the seed of israel be justified and shall glory
bel boweth down nebo stoopeth their idols were upon the beasts and upon the cattle your carriages were heavy loaden they are a burden to the weary beast
they stoop they bow down together they could not deliver the burden but themselves are gone into captivity
hearken unto me o house of jacob and all the remnant of the house of israel which are borne by me from the belly which are carried from the womb
and even to your old age i am he and even to hoar hairs will i carry you i have made and i will bear even i will carry and will deliver you
to whom will ye liken me and make me equal and compare me that we may be like
they lavish gold out of the bag and weigh silver in the balance and hire a goldsmith and he maketh it a god they fall down yea they worship
they bear him upon the shoulder they carry him and set him in his place and he standeth from his place shall he not remove yea one shall cry unto him yet can he not answer nor save him out of his trouble
remember this and shew yourselves men bring it again to mind o ye transgressors
remember the former things of old for i am god and there is none else i am god and there is none like me
declaring the end from the beginning and from ancient times the things that are not yet done saying my counsel shall stand and i will do all my pleasure
calling a ravenous bird from the east the man that executeth my counsel from a far country yea i have spoken it i will also bring it to pass i have purposed it i will also do it
