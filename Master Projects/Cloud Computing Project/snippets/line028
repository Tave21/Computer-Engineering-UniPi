and it shall come to pass if thou shalt hearken diligently unto the voice of the lord thy god to observe and to do all his commandments which i command thee this day that the lord thy god will set thee on high above all nations of the earth
and all these blessings shall come on thee and overtake thee if thou shalt hearken unto the voice of the lord thy god

and thou shalt not go aside from any of the words which i command thee this day to the right hand or to the left to go after other gods to serve them
but it shall come to pass if thou wilt not hearken unto the voice of the lord thy god to observe to do all his commandments and his statutes which i command thee this day that all these curses shall come upon thee and overtake thee
cursed shalt thou be in the city and cursed shalt thou be in the field

the lord will smite thee with the botch of egypt and with the emerods and with the scab and with the itch whereof thou canst not be healed

moreover all these curses shall come upon thee and shall pursue thee and overtake thee till thou be destroyed because thou hearkenedst not unto the voice of the lord thy god to keep his commandments and his statutes which he commanded thee
and they shall be upon thee for a sign and for a wonder and upon thy seed for ever
because thou servedst not the lord thy god with joyfulness and with gladness of heart for the abundance of all things
therefore shalt thou serve thine enemies which the lord shall send against thee in hunger and in thirst and in nakedness and in want of all things and he shall put a yoke of iron upon thy neck until he have destroyed thee
the lord shall bring a nation against thee from far from the end of the earth as swift as the eagle flieth a nation whose tongue thou shalt not understand

so that the man that is tender among you and very delicate his eye shall be evil toward his brother and toward the wife of his bosom and toward the remnant of his children which he shall leave

if thou wilt not observe to do all the words of this law that are written in this book that thou mayest fear this glorious and fearful name the lord thy god
then the lord will make thy plagues wonderful and the plagues of thy seed even great plagues and of long continuance and sore sicknesses and of long continuance
moreover he will bring upon thee all the diseases of egypt which thou wast afraid of and they shall cleave unto thee
also every sickness and every plague which is not written in the book of this law them will the lord bring upon thee until thou be destroyed
and ye shall be left few in number whereas ye were as the stars of heaven for multitude because thou wouldest not obey the voice of the lord thy god
and it shall come to pass that as the lord rejoiced over you to do you good and to multiply you so the lord will rejoice over you to destroy you and to bring you to nought and ye shall be plucked from off the land whither thou goest to possess it
and the lord shall scatter thee among all people from the one end of the earth even unto the other and there thou shalt serve other gods which neither thou nor thy fathers have known even wood and stone
and among these nations shalt thou find no ease neither shall the sole of thy foot have rest but the lord shall give thee there a trembling heart and failing of eyes and sorrow of mind
and thy life shall hang in doubt before thee and thou shalt fear day and night and shalt have none assurance of thy life
in the morning thou shalt say would god it were even and at even thou shalt say would god it were morning for the fear of thine heart wherewith thou shalt fear and for the sight of thine eyes which thou shalt see
and the lord shall bring thee into egypt again with ships by the way whereof i spake unto thee thou shalt see it no more again and there ye shall be sold unto your enemies for bondmen and bondwomen and no man shall buy you
these are the words of the covenant which the lord commanded moses to make with the children of israel in the land of moab beside the covenant which he made with them in horeb
and moses called unto all israel and said unto them ye have seen all that the lord did before your eyes in the land of egypt unto pharaoh and unto all his servants and unto all his land
the great temptations which thine eyes have seen the signs and those great miracles
yet the lord hath not given you an heart to perceive and eyes to see and ears to hear unto this day
and i have led you forty years in the wilderness your clothes are not waxen old upon you and thy shoe is not waxen old upon thy foot
ye have not eaten bread neither have ye drunk wine or strong drink that ye might know that i am the lord your god
and when ye came unto this place sihon the king of heshbon and og the king of bashan came out against us unto battle and we smote them
and we took their land and gave it for an inheritance unto the reubenites and to the gadites and to the half tribe of manasseh
keep therefore the words of this covenant and do them that ye may prosper in all that ye do
ye stand this day all of you before the lord your god your captains of your tribes your elders and your officers with all the men of israel
your little ones your wives and thy stranger that is in thy camp from the hewer of thy wood unto the drawer of thy water
that thou shouldest enter into covenant with the lord thy god and into his oath which the lord thy god maketh with thee this day
that he may establish thee to day for a people unto himself and that he may be unto thee a god as he hath said unto thee and as he hath sworn unto thy fathers to abraham to isaac and to jacob
neither with you only do i make this covenant and this oath
but with him that standeth here with us this day before the lord our god and also with him that is not here with us this day
for ye know how we have dwelt in the land of egypt and how we came through the nations which ye passed by
and ye have seen their abominations and their idols wood and stone silver and gold which were among them
lest there should be among you man or woman or family or tribe whose heart turneth away this day from the lord our god to go and serve the gods of these nations lest there should be among you a root that beareth gall and wormwood
and it come to pass when he heareth the words of this curse that he bless himself in his heart saying i shall have peace though i walk in the imagination of mine heart to add drunkenness to thirst
the lord will not spare him but then the anger of the lord and his jealousy shall smoke against that man and all the curses that are written in this book shall lie upon him and the lord shall blot out his name from under heaven
and the lord shall separate him unto evil out of all the tribes of israel according to all the curses of the covenant that are written in this book of the law
so that the generation to come of your children that shall rise up after you and the stranger that shall come from a far land shall say when they see the plagues of that land and the sicknesses which the lord hath laid upon it
and that the whole land thereof is brimstone and salt and burning that it is not sown nor beareth nor any grass groweth therein like the overthrow of sodom and gomorrah admah and zeboim which the lord overthrew in his anger and in his wrath
even all nations shall say wherefore hath the lord done thus unto this land what meaneth the heat of this great anger
then men shall say because they have forsaken the covenant of the lord god of their fathers which he made with them when he brought them forth out of the land of egypt
for they went and served other gods and worshipped them gods whom they knew not and whom he had not given unto them
and the anger of the lord was kindled against this land to bring upon it all the curses that are written in this book
and the lord rooted them out of their land in anger and in wrath and in great indignation and cast them into another land as it is this day
the secret things belong unto the lord our god but those things which are revealed belong unto us and to our children for ever that we may do all the words of this law
and it shall come to pass when all these things are come upon thee the blessing and the curse which i have set before thee and thou shalt call them to mind among all the nations whither the lord thy god hath driven thee
and shalt return unto the lord thy god and shalt obey his voice according to all that i command thee this day thou and thy children with all thine heart and with all thy soul
that then the lord thy god will turn thy captivity and have compassion upon thee and will return and gather thee from all the nations whither the lord thy god hath scattered thee
if any of thine be driven out unto the outmost parts of heaven from thence will the lord thy god gather thee and from thence will he fetch thee
and the lord thy god will bring thee into the land which thy fathers possessed and thou shalt possess it and he will do thee good and multiply thee above thy fathers
and the lord thy god will circumcise thine heart and the heart of thy seed to love the lord thy god with all thine heart and with all thy soul that thou mayest live
and the lord thy god will put all these curses upon thine enemies and on them that hate thee which persecuted thee
and thou shalt return and obey the voice of the lord and do all his commandments which i command thee this day
and the lord thy god will make thee plenteous in every work of thine hand in the fruit of thy body and in the fruit of thy cattle and in the fruit of thy land for good for the lord will again rejoice over thee for good as he rejoiced over thy fathers
if thou shalt hearken unto the voice of the lord thy god to keep his commandments and his statutes which are written in this book of the law and if thou turn unto the lord thy god with all thine heart and with all thy soul
for this commandment which i command thee this day it is not hidden from thee neither is it far off
it is not in heaven that thou shouldest say who shall go up for us to heaven and bring it unto us that we may hear it and do it
neither is it beyond the sea that thou shouldest say who shall go over the sea for us and bring it unto us that we may hear it and do it
but the word is very nigh unto thee in thy mouth and in thy heart that thou mayest do it
see i have set before thee this day life and good and death and evil
in that i command thee this day to love the lord thy god to walk in his ways and to keep his commandments and his statutes and his judgments that thou mayest live and multiply and the lord thy god shall bless thee in the land whither thou goest to possess it
but if thine heart turn away so that thou wilt not hear but shalt be drawn away and worship other gods and serve them
i denounce unto you this day that ye shall surely perish and that ye shall not prolong your days upon the land whither thou passest over jordan to go to possess it
i call heaven and earth to record this day against you that i have set before you life and death blessing and cursing therefore choose life that both thou and thy seed may live
that thou mayest love the lord thy god and that thou mayest obey his voice and that thou mayest cleave unto him for he is thy life and the length of thy days that thou mayest dwell in the land which the lord sware unto thy fathers to abraham to isaac and to jacob to give them
and moses went and spake these words unto all israel
and he said unto them i am an hundred and twenty years old this day i can no more go out and come in also the lord hath said unto me thou shalt not go over this jordan
the lord thy god he will go over before thee and he will destroy these nations from before thee and thou shalt possess them and joshua he shall go over before thee as the lord hath said
and the lord shall do unto them as he did to sihon and to og kings of the amorites and unto the land of them whom he destroyed
and the lord shall give them up before your face that ye may do unto them according unto all the commandments which i have commanded you
be strong and of a good courage fear not nor be afraid of them for the lord thy god he it is that doth go with thee he will not fail thee nor forsake thee
and moses called unto joshua and said unto him in the sight of all israel be strong and of a good courage for thou must go with this people unto the land which the lord hath sworn unto their fathers to give them and thou shalt cause them to inherit it
and the lord he it is that doth go before thee he will be with thee he will not fail thee neither forsake thee fear not neither be dismayed
and moses wrote this law and delivered it unto the priests the sons of levi which bare the ark of the covenant of the lord and unto all the elders of israel
and moses commanded them saying at the end of every seven years in the solemnity of the year of release in the feast of tabernacles
when all israel is come to appear before the lord thy god in the place which he shall choose thou shalt read this law before all israel in their hearing
gather the people together men and women and children and thy stranger that is within thy gates that they may hear and that they may learn and fear the lord your god and observe to do all the words of this law
and that their children which have not known any thing may hear and learn to fear the lord your god as long as ye live in the land whither ye go over jordan to possess it
and the lord said unto moses behold thy days approach that thou must die call joshua and present yourselves in the tabernacle of the congregation that i may give him a charge and moses and joshua went and presented themselves in the tabernacle of the congregation
and the lord appeared in the tabernacle in a pillar of a cloud and the pillar of the cloud stood over the door of the tabernacle
and the lord said unto moses behold thou shalt sleep with thy fathers and this people will rise up and go a whoring after the gods of the strangers of the land whither they go to be among them and will forsake me and break my covenant which i have made with them
then my anger shall be kindled against them in that day and i will forsake them and i will hide my face from them and they shall be devoured and many evils and troubles shall befall them so that they will say in that day are not these evils come upon us because our god is not among us
and i will surely hide my face in that day for all the evils which they shall have wrought in that they are turned unto other gods
now therefore write ye this song for you and teach it the children of israel put it in their mouths that this song may be a witness for me against the children of israel
for when i shall have brought them into the land which i sware unto their fathers that floweth with milk and honey and they shall have eaten and filled themselves and waxen fat then will they turn unto other gods and serve them and provoke me and break my covenant
and it shall come to pass when many evils and troubles are befallen them that this song shall testify against them as a witness for it shall not be forgotten out of the mouths of their seed for i know their imagination which they go about even now before i have brought them into the land which i sware
moses therefore wrote this song the same day and taught it the children of israel
and he gave joshua the son of nun a charge and said be strong and of a good courage for thou shalt bring the children of israel into the land which i sware unto them and i will be with thee
and it came to pass when moses had made an end of writing the words of this law in a book until they were finished
that moses commanded the levites which bare the ark of the covenant of the lord saying
take this book of the law and put it in the side of the ark of the covenant of the lord your god that it may be there for a witness against thee
for i know thy rebellion and thy stiff neck behold while i am yet alive with you this day ye have been rebellious against the lord and how much more after my death
gather unto me all the elders of your tribes and your officers that i may speak these words in their ears and call heaven and earth to record against them
for i know that after my death ye will utterly corrupt yourselves and turn aside from the way which i have commanded you and evil will befall you in the latter days because ye will do evil in the sight of the lord to provoke him to anger through the work of your hands
and moses spake in the ears of all the congregation of israel the words of this song until they were ended
give ear o ye heavens and i will speak and hear o earth the words of my mouth
my doctrine shall drop as the rain my speech shall distil as the dew as the small rain upon the tender herb and as the showers upon the grass
because i will publish the name of the lord ascribe ye greatness unto our god
he is the rock his work is perfect for all his ways are judgment a god of truth and without iniquity just and right is he
they have corrupted themselves their spot is not the spot of his children they are a perverse and crooked generation
do ye thus requite the lord o foolish people and unwise is not he thy father that hath bought thee hath he not made thee and established thee
remember the days of old consider the years of many generations ask thy father and he will shew thee thy elders and they will tell thee
when the most high divided to the nations their inheritance when he separated the sons of adam he set the bounds of the people according to the number of the children of israel
for the lord's portion is his people jacob is the lot of his inheritance
he found him in a desert land and in the waste howling wilderness he led him about he instructed him he kept him as the apple of his eye
as an eagle stirreth up her nest fluttereth over her young spreadeth abroad her wings taketh them beareth them on her wings
so the lord alone did lead him and there was no strange god with him
he made him ride on the high places of the earth that he might eat the increase of the fields and he made him to suck honey out of the rock and oil out of the flinty rock
butter of kine and milk of sheep with fat of lambs and rams of the breed of bashan and goats with the fat of kidneys of wheat and thou didst drink the pure blood of the grape
but jeshurun waxed fat and kicked thou art waxen fat thou art grown thick thou art covered with fatness then he forsook god which made him and lightly esteemed the rock of his salvation
they provoked him to jealousy with strange gods with abominations provoked they him to anger
they sacrificed unto devils not to god to gods whom they knew not to new gods that came newly up whom your fathers feared not
of the rock that begat thee thou art unmindful and hast forgotten god that formed thee
and when the lord saw it he abhorred them because of the provoking of his sons and of his daughters
and he said i will hide my face from them i will see what their end shall be for they are a very froward generation children in whom is no faith
they have moved me to jealousy with that which is not god they have provoked me to anger with their vanities and i will move them to jealousy with those which are not a people i will provoke them to anger with a foolish nation
for a fire is kindled in mine anger and shall burn unto the lowest hell and shall consume the earth with her increase and set on fire the foundations of the mountains
i will heap mischiefs upon them i will spend mine arrows upon them
they shall be burnt with hunger and devoured with burning heat and with bitter destruction i will also send the teeth of beasts upon them with the poison of serpents of the dust
the sword without and terror within shall destroy both the young man and the virgin the suckling also with the man of gray hairs
i said i would scatter them into corners i would make the remembrance of them to cease from among men
were it not that i feared the wrath of the enemy lest their adversaries should behave themselves strangely and lest they should say our hand is high and the lord hath not done all this
for they are a nation void of counsel neither is there any understanding in them
o that they were wise that they understood this that they would consider their latter end
how should one chase a thousand and two put ten thousand to flight except their rock had sold them and the lord had shut them up
for their rock is not as our rock even our enemies themselves being judges
for their vine is of the vine of sodom and of the fields of gomorrah their grapes are grapes of gall their clusters are bitter
their wine is the poison of dragons and the cruel venom of asps
is not this laid up in store with me and sealed up among my treasures
to me belongeth vengeance and recompence their foot shall slide in due time for the day of their calamity is at hand and the things that shall come upon them make haste
for the lord shall judge his people and repent himself for his servants when he seeth that their power is gone and there is none shut up or left
and he shall say where are their gods their rock in whom they trusted
which did eat the fat of their sacrifices and drank the wine of their drink offerings let them rise up and help you and be your protection
see now that i even i am he and there is no god with me i kill and i make alive i wound and i heal neither is there any that can deliver out of my hand
