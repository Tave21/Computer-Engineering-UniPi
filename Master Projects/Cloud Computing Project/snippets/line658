 when that my care could not withhold thy riots
 what wilt thou do when riot is thy care
 o thou wilt be a wilderness again
 peopled with wolves thy old inhabitants
prince henry o pardon me my liege but for my tears
 the moist impediments unto my speech
 i had forestall'd this dear and deep rebuke
 ere you with grief had spoke and i had heard
 the course of it so far there is your crown
 and he that wears the crown immortally
 long guard it yours if i affect it more
 than as your honour and as your renown
 let me no more from this obedience rise
 which my most inward true and duteous spirit
 teacheth this prostrate and exterior bending
 god witness with me when i here came in
 and found no course of breath within your majesty
 how cold it struck my heart if i do feign
 o let me in my present wildness die
 and never live to show the incredulous world
 the noble change that i have purposed
 coming to look on you thinking you dead
 and dead almost my liege to think you were
 i spake unto this crown as having sense
 and thus upbraided it the care on thee depending
 hath fed upon the body of my father
 therefore thou best of gold art worst of gold
 other less fine in carat is more precious
 preserving life in medicine potable
 but thou most fine most honour'd most renown'd
 hast eat thy bearer up thus my most royal liege
 accusing it i put it on my head
 to try with it as with an enemy
 that had before my face murder'd my father
 the quarrel of a true inheritor
 but if it did infect my blood with joy
 or swell my thoughts to any strain of pride
 if any rebel or vain spirit of mine
 did with the least affection of a welcome
 give entertainment to the might of it
 let god for ever keep it from my head
 and make me as the poorest vassal is
 that doth with awe and terror kneel to it
king henry iv o my son
 god put it in thy mind to take it hence
 that thou mightst win the more thy father's love
 pleading so wisely in excuse of it
 come hither harry sit thou by my bed
 and hear i think the very latest counsel
 that ever i shall breathe god knows my son
 by what bypaths and indirect crook'd ways
 i met this crown and i myself know well
 how troublesome it sat upon my head
 to thee it shall descend with bitter quiet
 better opinion better confirmation
 for all the soil of the achievement goes
 with me into the earth it seem'd in me
 but as an honour snatch'd with boisterous hand
 and i had many living to upbraid
 my gain of it by their assistances
 which daily grew to quarrel and to bloodshed
 wounding supposed peace all these bold fears
 thou see'st with peril i have answered
 for all my reign hath been but as a scene
 acting that argument and now my death
 changes the mode for what in me was purchased
 falls upon thee in a more fairer sort
 so thou the garland wear'st successively
 yet though thou stand'st more sure than i could do
 thou art not firm enough since griefs are green
 and all my friends which thou must make thy friends
 have but their stings and teeth newly ta'en out
 by whose fell working i was first advanced
 and by whose power i well might lodge a fear
 to be again displaced which to avoid
 i cut them off and had a purpose now
 to lead out many to the holy land
 lest rest and lying still might make them look
 too near unto my state therefore my harry
 be it thy course to busy giddy minds
 with foreign quarrels that action hence borne out
 may waste the memory of the former days
 more would i but my lungs are wasted so
 that strength of speech is utterly denied me
 how i came by the crown o god forgive
 and grant it may with thee in true peace live
prince henry my gracious liege
 you won it wore it kept it gave it me
 then plain and right must my possession be
 which i with more than with a common pain
 gainst all the world will rightfully maintain
 enter lord john of lancaster
king henry iv look look here comes my john of lancaster
lancaster health peace and happiness to my royal father
king henry iv thou bring'st me happiness and peace son john
 but health alack with youthful wings is flown
 from this bare wither'd trunk upon thy sight
 my worldly business makes a period
 where is my lord of warwick
prince henry my lord of warwick
 enter warwick and others
king henry iv doth any name particular belong
 unto the lodging where i first did swoon
warwick tis call'd jerusalem my noble lord
king henry iv laud be to god even there my life must end
 it hath been prophesied to me many years
 i should not die but in jerusalem
 which vainly i supposed the holy land
 but bear me to that chamber there i'll lie
 in that jerusalem shall harry die

act v
scene i gloucestershire shallow's house
 enter shallow falstaff bardolph and page
shallow by cock and pie sir you shall not away tonight
 what davy i say
falstaff you must excuse me master robert shallow
shallow i will not excuse you you shall not be excused
 excuses shall not be admitted there is no excuse
 shall serve you shall not be excused why davy
 enter davy
davy here sir
shallow davy davy davy davy let me see davy let me
 see davy let me see yea marry william cook
 bid him come hither sir john you shall not be excused
davy marry sir thus those precepts cannot be served
 and again sir shall we sow the headland with wheat
shallow with red wheat davy but for william cook are
 there no young pigeons
davy yes sir here is now the smith's note for shoeing
 and ploughirons
shallow let it be cast and paid sir john you shall not be excused
davy now sir a new link to the bucket must need be
 had and sir do you mean to stop any of william's
 wages about the sack he lost the other day at
 hinckley fair
shallow a shall answer it some pigeons davy a couple
 of shortlegged hens a joint of mutton and any
 pretty little tiny kickshaws tell william cook
davy doth the man of war stay all night sir
shallow yea davy i will use him well a friend i the
 court is better than a penny in purse use his men
 well davy for they are arrant knaves and will backbite
davy no worse than they are backbitten sir for they
 have marvellous foul linen
shallow well conceited davy about thy business davy
davy i beseech you sir to countenance william visor of
 woncot against clement perkes of the hill
shallow there is many complaints davy against that visor
 that visor is an arrant knave on my knowledge
davy i grant your worship that he is a knave sir but
 yet god forbid sir but a knave should have some
 countenance at his friend's request an honest
 man sir is able to speak for himself when a knave
 is not i have served your worship truly sir
 this eight years and if i cannot once or twice in
 a quarter bear out a knave against an honest man i
 have but a very little credit with your worship the
 knave is mine honest friend sir therefore i
 beseech your worship let him be countenanced
shallow go to i say he shall have no wrong look about davy
 exit davy
 where are you sir john come come come off
 with your boots give me your hand master bardolph
bardolph i am glad to see your worship
shallow i thank thee with all my heart kind
 master bardolph and welcome my tall fellow
 to the page
 come sir john
falstaff i'll follow you good master robert shallow
 exit shallow
 bardolph look to our horses
 exeunt bardolph and page
 if i were sawed into quantities i should make four
 dozen of such bearded hermits staves as master
 shallow it is a wonderful thing to see the
 semblable coherence of his men's spirits and his
 they by observing of him do bear themselves like
 foolish justices he by conversing with them is
 turned into a justicelike servingman their
 spirits are so married in conjunction with the
 participation of society that they flock together in
 consent like so many wildgeese if i had a suit
 to master shallow i would humour his men with the
 imputation of being near their master if to his
 men i would curry with master shallow that no man
 could better command his servants it is certain
 that either wise bearing or ignorant carriage is
 caught as men take diseases one of another
 therefore let men take heed of their company i
 will devise matter enough out of this shallow to
 keep prince harry in continual laughter the wearing
 out of six fashions which is four terms or two
 actions and a shall laugh without intervallums o
 it is much that a lie with a slight oath and a jest
 with a sad brow will do with a fellow that never
 had the ache in his shoulders o you shall see him
 laugh till his face be like a wet cloak ill laid up
shallow within sir john
