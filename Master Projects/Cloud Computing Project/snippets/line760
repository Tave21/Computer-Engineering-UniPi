 that brings me food to make misfortune live
groom i was a poor groom of thy stable king
 when thou wert king who travelling towards york
 with much ado at length have gotten leave
 to look upon my sometimes royal master's face
 o how it yearn'd my heart when i beheld
 in london streets that coronationday
 when bolingbroke rode on roan barbary
 that horse that thou so often hast bestrid
 that horse that i so carefully have dress'd
king richard ii rode he on barbary tell me gentle friend
 how went he under him
groom so proudly as if he disdain'd the ground
king richard ii so proud that bolingbroke was on his back
 that jade hath eat bread from my royal hand
 this hand hath made him proud with clapping him
 would he not stumble would he not fall down
 since pride must have a fall and break the neck
 of that proud man that did usurp his back
 forgiveness horse why do i rail on thee
 since thou created to be awed by man
 wast born to bear i was not made a horse
 and yet i bear a burthen like an ass
 spurr'd gall'd and tired by jouncing bolingbroke
 enter keeper with a dish
keeper fellow give place here is no longer stay
king richard ii if thou love me tis time thou wert away
groom what my tongue dares not that my heart shall say
 exit
keeper my lord will't please you to fall to
king richard ii taste of it first as thou art wont to do
keeper my lord i dare not sir pierce of exton who
 lately came from the king commands the contrary
king richard ii the devil take henry of lancaster and thee
 patience is stale and i am weary of it
 beats the keeper
keeper help help help
 enter exton and servants armed
king richard ii how now what means death in this rude assault
 villain thy own hand yields thy death's instrument
 snatching an axe from a servant and killing him
 go thou and fill another room in hell
 he kills another then exton strikes him down
 that hand shall burn in neverquenching fire
 that staggers thus my person exton thy fierce hand
 hath with the king's blood stain'd the king's own land
 mount mount my soul thy seat is up on high
 whilst my gross flesh sinks downward here to die
 dies
exton as full of valour as of royal blood
 both have i spill'd o would the deed were good
 for now the devil that told me i did well
 says that this deed is chronicled in hell
 this dead king to the living king i'll bear
 take hence the rest and give them burial here

 flourish enter henry bolingbroke duke of york
 with other lords and attendants
henry bolingbroke kind uncle york the latest news we hear
 is that the rebels have consumed with fire
 our town of cicester in gloucestershire
 but whether they be ta'en or slain we hear not
 enter northumberland
 welcome my lord what is the news
northumberland first to thy sacred state wish i all happiness
 the next news is i have to london sent
 the heads of oxford salisbury blunt and kent
 the manner of their taking may appear
 at large discoursed in this paper here
henry bolingbroke we thank thee gentle percy for thy pains
 and to thy worth will add right worthy gains
 enter lord fitzwater
lord fitzwater my lord i have from oxford sent to london
 the heads of brocas and sir bennet seely
 two of the dangerous consorted traitors
 that sought at oxford thy dire overthrow
henry bolingbroke thy pains fitzwater shall not be forgot
 right noble is thy merit well i wot
 enter henry percy and the bishop of carlisle
henry percy the grand conspirator abbot of westminster
 with clog of conscience and sour melancholy
 hath yielded up his body to the grave
 but here is carlisle living to abide
 thy kingly doom and sentence of his pride
henry bolingbroke carlisle this is your doom
 choose out some secret place some reverend room
 more than thou hast and with it joy thy life
 so as thou livest in peace die free from strife
 for though mine enemy thou hast ever been
 high sparks of honour in thee have i seen
 enter exton with persons bearing a coffin
exton great king within this coffin i present
 thy buried fear herein all breathless lies
 the mightiest of thy greatest enemies
 richard of bordeaux by me hither brought
henry bolingbroke exton i thank thee not for thou hast wrought
 a deed of slander with thy fatal hand
 upon my head and all this famous land
exton from your own mouth my lord did i this deed
henry bolingbroke they love not poison that do poison need
 nor do i thee though i did wish him dead
 i hate the murderer love him murdered
 the guilt of conscience take thou for thy labour
 but neither my good word nor princely favour
 with cain go wander through shades of night
 and never show thy head by day nor light
 lords i protest my soul is full of woe
 that blood should sprinkle me to make me grow
 come mourn with me for that i do lament
 and put on sullen black incontinent
 i'll make a voyage to the holy land
 to wash this blood off from my guilty hand
 march sadly after grace my mournings here
 in weeping after this untimely bier
