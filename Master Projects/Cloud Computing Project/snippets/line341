he falls and bathes the pale fear in his face
and counterfeits to die with her a space
till manly shame bids him possess his breath
and live to be revenged on her death
the deep vexation of his inward soul
hath served a dumb arrest upon his tongue
who mad that sorrow should his use control
or keep him from hearteasing words so long
begins to talk but through his lips do throng
weak words so thick come in his poor heart's aid
that no man could distinguish what he said
yet sometime tarquin was pronounced plain
but through his teeth as if the name he tore
this windy tempest till it blow up rain
held back his sorrow's tide to make it more
at last it rains and busy winds give o'er
then son and father weep with equal strife
who should weep most for daughter or for wife
the one doth call her his the other his
yet neither may possess the claim they lay
the father says she's mine o mine she is'
replies her husband do not take away
my sorrow's interest let no mourner say
he weeps for her for she was only mine
and only must be wail'd by collatine'
'o quoth lucretius i did give that life
which she too early and too late hath spill'd'
'woe woe quoth collatine she was my wife
i owed her and tis mine that she hath kill'd'
'my daughter and my wife with clamours fill'd
the dispersed air who holding lucrece life
answer'd their cries my daughter and my wife'
brutus who pluck'd the knife from lucrece side
seeing such emulation in their woe
began to clothe his wit in state and pride
burying in lucrece wound his folly's show
he with the romans was esteemed so
as sillyjeering idiots are with kings
for sportive words and uttering foolish things
but now he throws that shallow habit by
wherein deep policy did him disguise
and arm'd his longhid wits advisedly
to cheque the tears in collatinus eyes
'thou wronged lord of rome quoth be arise
let my unsounded self supposed a fool
now set thy longexperienced wit to school
'why collatine is woe the cure for woe
do wounds help wounds or grief help grievous deeds
is it revenge to give thyself a blow
for his foul act by whom thy fair wife bleeds
such childish humour from weak minds proceeds
thy wretched wife mistook the matter so
to slay herself that should have slain her foe
'courageous roman do not steep thy heart
in such relenting dew of lamentations
but kneel with me and help to bear thy part
to rouse our roman gods with invocations
that they will suffer these abominations
since rome herself in them doth stand disgraced
by our strong arms from forth her fair streets chased
'now by the capitol that we adore
and by this chaste blood so unjustly stain'd
by heaven's fair sun that breeds the fat earth's
store
by all our country rights in rome maintain'd
and by chaste lucrece soul that late complain'd
her wrongs to us and by this bloody knife
we will revenge the death of this true wife'
this said he struck his hand upon his breast
and kiss'd the fatal knife to end his vow
and to his protestation urged the rest
who wondering at him did his words allow
then jointly to the ground their knees they bow
and that deep vow which brutus made before
he doth again repeat and that they swore
when they had sworn to this advised doom
they did conclude to bear dead lucrece thence
to show her bleeding body thorough rome
and so to publish tarquin's foul offence
which being done with speedy diligence
the romans plausibly did give consent
to tarquin's everlasting banishment
 sonnets
to the only begetter of
these insuing sonnets
mr w h all happiness
and that eternity
promised by
our everliving poet wisheth
the wellwishing
adventurer in
setting forth
t t
i
from fairest creatures we desire increase
that thereby beauty's rose might never die
but as the riper should by time decease
his tender heir might bear his memory
but thou contracted to thine own bright eyes
feed'st thy light'st flame with selfsubstantial fuel
making a famine where abundance lies
thyself thy foe to thy sweet self too cruel
thou that art now the world's fresh ornament
and only herald to the gaudy spring
within thine own bud buriest thy content
and tender churl makest waste in niggarding
 pity the world or else this glutton be
 to eat the world's due by the grave and thee
ii
when forty winters shall beseige thy brow
and dig deep trenches in thy beauty's field
thy youth's proud livery so gazed on now
will be a tatter'd weed of small worth held
then being ask'd where all thy beauty lies
where all the treasure of thy lusty days
to say within thine own deepsunken eyes
were an alleating shame and thriftless praise
how much more praise deserved thy beauty's use
if thou couldst answer this fair child of mine
shall sum my count and make my old excuse'
proving his beauty by succession thine
 this were to be new made when thou art old
 and see thy blood warm when thou feel'st it cold
iii
look in thy glass and tell the face thou viewest
now is the time that face should form another
whose fresh repair if now thou not renewest
thou dost beguile the world unbless some mother
for where is she so fair whose unear'd womb
disdains the tillage of thy husbandry
or who is he so fond will be the tomb
of his selflove to stop posterity
thou art thy mother's glass and she in thee
calls back the lovely april of her prime
so thou through windows of thine age shall see
despite of wrinkles this thy golden time
 but if thou live remember'd not to be
 die single and thine image dies with thee
iv
unthrifty loveliness why dost thou spend
upon thyself thy beauty's legacy
nature's bequest gives nothing but doth lend
and being frank she lends to those are free
then beauteous niggard why dost thou abuse
the bounteous largess given thee to give
profitless usurer why dost thou use
so great a sum of sums yet canst not live
for having traffic with thyself alone
thou of thyself thy sweet self dost deceive
then how when nature calls thee to be gone
what acceptable audit canst thou leave
 thy unused beauty must be tomb'd with thee
 which used lives th executor to be
v
those hours that with gentle work did frame
the lovely gaze where every eye doth dwell
will play the tyrants to the very same
and that unfair which fairly doth excel
for neverresting time leads summer on
to hideous winter and confounds him there
sap cheque'd with frost and lusty leaves quite gone
beauty o'ersnow'd and bareness every where
then were not summer's distillation left
a liquid prisoner pent in walls of glass
beauty's effect with beauty were bereft
nor it nor no remembrance what it was
 but flowers distill'd though they with winter meet
 leese but their show their substance still lives sweet
vi
then let not winter's ragged hand deface
in thee thy summer ere thou be distill'd
make sweet some vial treasure thou some place
with beauty's treasure ere it be selfkill'd
that use is not forbidden usury
which happies those that pay the willing loan
that's for thyself to breed another thee
or ten times happier be it ten for one
ten times thyself were happier than thou art
if ten of thine ten times refigured thee
then what could death do if thou shouldst depart
leaving thee living in posterity
 be not selfwill'd for thou art much too fair
 to be death's conquest and make worms thine heir
vii
lo in the orient when the gracious light
lifts up his burning head each under eye
doth homage to his newappearing sight
serving with looks his sacred majesty
and having climb'd the steepup heavenly hill
resembling strong youth in his middle age
yet mortal looks adore his beauty still
attending on his golden pilgrimage
but when from highmost pitch with weary car
like feeble age he reeleth from the day
the eyes fore duteous now converted are
from his low tract and look another way
 so thou thyself outgoing in thy noon
 unlook'd on diest unless thou get a son
viii
music to hear why hear'st thou music sadly
