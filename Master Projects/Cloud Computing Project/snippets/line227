 i do entreat you not a man depart
 save i alone till antony have spoke
 exit
first citizen stay ho and let us hear mark antony
third citizen let him go up into the public chair
 we'll hear him noble antony go up
antony for brutus sake i am beholding to you
 goes into the pulpit
fourth citizen what does he say of brutus
third citizen he says for brutus sake
 he finds himself beholding to us all
fourth citizen twere best he speak no harm of brutus here
first citizen this caesar was a tyrant
third citizen nay that's certain
 we are blest that rome is rid of him
second citizen peace let us hear what antony can say
antony you gentle romans
citizens peace ho let us hear him
antony friends romans countrymen lend me your ears
 i come to bury caesar not to praise him
 the evil that men do lives after them
 the good is oft interred with their bones
 so let it be with caesar the noble brutus
 hath told you caesar was ambitious
 if it were so it was a grievous fault
 and grievously hath caesar answer'd it
 here under leave of brutus and the rest
 for brutus is an honourable man
 so are they all all honourable men
 come i to speak in caesar's funeral
 he was my friend faithful and just to me
 but brutus says he was ambitious
 and brutus is an honourable man
 he hath brought many captives home to rome
 whose ransoms did the general coffers fill
 did this in caesar seem ambitious
 when that the poor have cried caesar hath wept
 ambition should be made of sterner stuff
 yet brutus says he was ambitious
 and brutus is an honourable man
 you all did see that on the lupercal
 i thrice presented him a kingly crown
 which he did thrice refuse was this ambition
 yet brutus says he was ambitious
 and sure he is an honourable man
 i speak not to disprove what brutus spoke
 but here i am to speak what i do know
 you all did love him once not without cause
 what cause withholds you then to mourn for him
 o judgment thou art fled to brutish beasts
 and men have lost their reason bear with me
 my heart is in the coffin there with caesar
 and i must pause till it come back to me
first citizen methinks there is much reason in his sayings
second citizen if thou consider rightly of the matter
 caesar has had great wrong
third citizen has he masters
 i fear there will a worse come in his place
fourth citizen mark'd ye his words he would not take the crown
 therefore tis certain he was not ambitious
first citizen if it be found so some will dear abide it
second citizen poor soul his eyes are red as fire with weeping
third citizen there's not a nobler man in rome than antony
fourth citizen now mark him he begins again to speak
antony but yesterday the word of caesar might
 have stood against the world now lies he there
 and none so poor to do him reverence
 o masters if i were disposed to stir
 your hearts and minds to mutiny and rage
 i should do brutus wrong and cassius wrong
 who you all know are honourable men
 i will not do them wrong i rather choose
 to wrong the dead to wrong myself and you
 than i will wrong such honourable men
 but here's a parchment with the seal of caesar
 i found it in his closet tis his will
 let but the commons hear this testament
 which pardon me i do not mean to read
 and they would go and kiss dead caesar's wounds
 and dip their napkins in his sacred blood
 yea beg a hair of him for memory
 and dying mention it within their wills
 bequeathing it as a rich legacy
 unto their issue
fourth citizen we'll hear the will read it mark antony
all the will the will we will hear caesar's will
antony have patience gentle friends i must not read it
 it is not meet you know how caesar loved you
 you are not wood you are not stones but men
 and being men bearing the will of caesar
 it will inflame you it will make you mad
 tis good you know not that you are his heirs
 for if you should o what would come of it
fourth citizen read the will we'll hear it antony
 you shall read us the will caesar's will
antony will you be patient will you stay awhile
 i have o'ershot myself to tell you of it
 i fear i wrong the honourable men
 whose daggers have stabb'd caesar i do fear it
fourth citizen they were traitors honourable men
all the will the testament
second citizen they were villains murderers the will read the will
antony you will compel me then to read the will
 then make a ring about the corpse of caesar
 and let me show you him that made the will
 shall i descend and will you give me leave
several citizens come down
second citizen descend
third citizen you shall have leave
 antony comes down
fourth citizen a ring stand round
first citizen stand from the hearse stand from the body
second citizen room for antony most noble antony
antony nay press not so upon me stand far off
several citizens stand back room bear back
antony if you have tears prepare to shed them now
 you all do know this mantle i remember
 the first time ever caesar put it on
 twas on a summer's evening in his tent
 that day he overcame the nervii
 look in this place ran cassius dagger through
 see what a rent the envious casca made
 through this the wellbeloved brutus stabb'd
 and as he pluck'd his cursed steel away
 mark how the blood of caesar follow'd it
 as rushing out of doors to be resolved
 if brutus so unkindly knock'd or no
 for brutus as you know was caesar's angel
 judge o you gods how dearly caesar loved him
 this was the most unkindest cut of all
 for when the noble caesar saw him stab
 ingratitude more strong than traitors arms
 quite vanquish'd him then burst his mighty heart
 and in his mantle muffling up his face
 even at the base of pompey's statua
 which all the while ran blood great caesar fell
 o what a fall was there my countrymen
 then i and you and all of us fell down
 whilst bloody treason flourish'd over us
 o now you weep and i perceive you feel
 the dint of pity these are gracious drops
 kind souls what weep you when you but behold
 our caesar's vesture wounded look you here
 here is himself marr'd as you see with traitors
first citizen o piteous spectacle
second citizen o noble caesar
third citizen o woful day
fourth citizen o traitors villains
first citizen o most bloody sight
second citizen we will be revenged
all revenge about seek burn fire kill slay
 let not a traitor live
antony stay countrymen
first citizen peace there hear the noble antony
second citizen we'll hear him we'll follow him we'll die with him
antony good friends sweet friends let me not stir you up
 to such a sudden flood of mutiny
 they that have done this deed are honourable
 what private griefs they have alas i know not
 that made them do it they are wise and honourable
 and will no doubt with reasons answer you
 i come not friends to steal away your hearts
 i am no orator as brutus is
 but as you know me all a plain blunt man
 that love my friend and that they know full well
 that gave me public leave to speak of him
 for i have neither wit nor words nor worth
 action nor utterance nor the power of speech
 to stir men's blood i only speak right on
 i tell you that which you yourselves do know
 show you sweet caesar's wounds poor poor dumb mouths
 and bid them speak for me but were i brutus
 and brutus antony there were an antony
 would ruffle up your spirits and put a tongue
 in every wound of caesar that should move
 the stones of rome to rise and mutiny
all we'll mutiny
first citizen we'll burn the house of brutus
third citizen away then come seek the conspirators
antony yet hear me countrymen yet hear me speak
all peace ho hear antony most noble antony
antony why friends you go to do you know not what
 wherein hath caesar thus deserved your loves
 alas you know not i must tell you then
 you have forgot the will i told you of
all most true the will let's stay and hear the will
antony here is the will and under caesar's seal
 to every roman citizen he gives
 to every several man seventyfive drachmas
second citizen most noble caesar we'll revenge his death
third citizen o royal caesar
antony hear me with patience
all peace ho
antony moreover he hath left you all his walks
 his private arbours and newplanted orchards
 on this side tiber he hath left them you
 and to your heirs for ever common pleasures
 to walk abroad and recreate yourselves
 here was a caesar when comes such another
first citizen never never come away away
