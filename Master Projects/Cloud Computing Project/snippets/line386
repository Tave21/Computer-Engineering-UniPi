jaques aside o knowledge illinhabited worse than jove
 in a thatched house
touchstone when a man's verses cannot be understood nor a
 man's good wit seconded with the forward child
 understanding it strikes a man more dead than a
 great reckoning in a little room truly i would
 the gods had made thee poetical
audrey i do not know what poetical is is it honest in
 deed and word is it a true thing
touchstone no truly for the truest poetry is the most
 feigning and lovers are given to poetry and what
 they swear in poetry may be said as lovers they do feign
audrey do you wish then that the gods had made me poetical
touchstone i do truly for thou swearest to me thou art
 honest now if thou wert a poet i might have some
 hope thou didst feign
audrey would you not have me honest
touchstone no truly unless thou wert hardfavoured for
 honesty coupled to beauty is to have honey a sauce to sugar
jaques aside a material fool
audrey well i am not fair and therefore i pray the gods
 make me honest
touchstone truly and to cast away honesty upon a foul slut
 were to put good meat into an unclean dish
audrey i am not a slut though i thank the gods i am foul
touchstone well praised be the gods for thy foulness
 sluttishness may come hereafter but be it as it may
 be i will marry thee and to that end i have been
 with sir oliver martext the vicar of the next
 village who hath promised to meet me in this place
 of the forest and to couple us
jaques aside i would fain see this meeting
audrey well the gods give us joy
touchstone amen a man may if he were of a fearful heart
 stagger in this attempt for here we have no temple
 but the wood no assembly but hornbeasts but what
 though courage as horns are odious they are
 necessary it is said many a man knows no end of
 his goods right many a man has good horns and
 knows no end of them well that is the dowry of
 his wife tis none of his own getting horns
 even so poor men alone no no the noblest deer
 hath them as huge as the rascal is the single man
 therefore blessed no as a walled town is more
 worthier than a village so is the forehead of a
 married man more honourable than the bare brow of a
 bachelor and by how much defence is better than no
 skill by so much is a horn more precious than to
 want here comes sir oliver
 enter sir oliver martext
 sir oliver martext you are well met will you
 dispatch us here under this tree or shall we go
 with you to your chapel
sir oliver martext is there none here to give the woman
touchstone i will not take her on gift of any man
sir oliver martext truly she must be given or the marriage is not lawful
jaques advancing
 proceed proceed i'll give her
touchstone good even good master whatyecall't how do you
 sir you are very well met god ild you for your
 last company i am very glad to see you even a
 toy in hand here sir nay pray be covered
jaques will you be married motley
touchstone as the ox hath his bow sir the horse his curb and
 the falcon her bells so man hath his desires and
 as pigeons bill so wedlock would be nibbling
jaques and will you being a man of your breeding be
 married under a bush like a beggar get you to
 church and have a good priest that can tell you
 what marriage is this fellow will but join you
 together as they join wainscot then one of you will
 prove a shrunk panel and like green timber warp warp
touchstone aside i am not in the mind but i were better to be
 married of him than of another for he is not like
 to marry me well and not being well married it
 will be a good excuse for me hereafter to leave my wife
jaques go thou with me and let me counsel thee
touchstone come sweet audrey

act iii
scene iv the forest
 enter rosalind and celia
rosalind never talk to me i will weep
celia do i prithee but yet have the grace to consider
 that tears do not become a man
rosalind but have i not cause to weep
celia as good cause as one would desire therefore weep
rosalind his very hair is of the dissembling colour
celia something browner than judas's marry his kisses are
 judas's own children
rosalind i faith his hair is of a good colour
celia an excellent colour your chestnut was ever the only colour
rosalind and his kissing is as full of sanctity as the touch
 of holy bread
celia he hath bought a pair of cast lips of diana a nun
 of winter's sisterhood kisses not more religiously
 the very ice of chastity is in them
rosalind but why did he swear he would come this morning and
 comes not
celia nay certainly there is no truth in him
rosalind do you think so
celia yes i think he is not a pickpurse nor a
 horsestealer but for his verity in love i do
 think him as concave as a covered goblet or a
 wormeaten nut
rosalind not true in love
celia yes when he is in but i think he is not in
rosalind you have heard him swear downright he was
celia was is not is besides the oath of a lover is
 no stronger than the word of a tapster they are
 both the confirmer of false reckonings he attends
 here in the forest on the duke your father
rosalind i met the duke yesterday and had much question with
 him he asked me of what parentage i was i told
 him of as good as he so he laughed and let me go
 but what talk we of fathers when there is such a
 man as orlando
celia o that's a brave man he writes brave verses
 speaks brave words swears brave oaths and breaks
 them bravely quite traverse athwart the heart of
 his lover as a puisny tilter that spurs his horse
 but on one side breaks his staff like a noble
 goose but all's brave that youth mounts and folly
 guides who comes here
 enter corin
corin mistress and master you have oft inquired
 after the shepherd that complain'd of love
 who you saw sitting by me on the turf
 praising the proud disdainful shepherdess
 that was his mistress
celia well and what of him
corin if you will see a pageant truly play'd
 between the pale complexion of true love
 and the red glow of scorn and proud disdain
 go hence a little and i shall conduct you
 if you will mark it
rosalind o come let us remove
 the sight of lovers feedeth those in love
 bring us to this sight and you shall say
 i'll prove a busy actor in their play
 exeunt
 as you like it
act iii
scene v another part of the forest
 enter silvius and phebe
silvius sweet phebe do not scorn me do not phebe
 say that you love me not but say not so
 in bitterness the common executioner
 whose heart the accustom'd sight of death makes hard
 falls not the axe upon the humbled neck
 but first begs pardon will you sterner be
 than he that dies and lives by bloody drops
 enter rosalind celia and corin behind
phebe i would not be thy executioner
 i fly thee for i would not injure thee
 thou tell'st me there is murder in mine eye
 tis pretty sure and very probable
 that eyes that are the frail'st and softest things
 who shut their coward gates on atomies
 should be call'd tyrants butchers murderers
 now i do frown on thee with all my heart
 and if mine eyes can wound now let them kill thee
 now counterfeit to swoon why now fall down
 or if thou canst not o for shame for shame
 lie not to say mine eyes are murderers
 now show the wound mine eye hath made in thee
 scratch thee but with a pin and there remains
 some scar of it lean but upon a rush
 the cicatrice and capable impressure
 thy palm some moment keeps but now mine eyes
 which i have darted at thee hurt thee not
 nor i am sure there is no force in eyes
 that can do hurt
silvius o dear phebe
 if everas that ever may be near
 you meet in some fresh cheek the power of fancy
 then shall you know the wounds invisible
 that love's keen arrows make
phebe but till that time
 come not thou near me and when that time comes
 afflict me with thy mocks pity me not
 as till that time i shall not pity thee
rosalind and why i pray you who might be your mother
 that you insult exult and all at once
 over the wretched what though you have no beauty
 as by my faith i see no more in you
 than without candle may go dark to bed
 must you be therefore proud and pitiless
