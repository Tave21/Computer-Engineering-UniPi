all hector the gods forbid
troilus he's dead and at the murderer's horse's tail
 in beastly sort dragg'd through the shameful field
 frown on you heavens effect your rage with speed
 sit gods upon your thrones and smile at troy
 i say at once let your brief plagues be mercy
 and linger not our sure destructions on
aeneas my lord you do discomfort all the host
troilus you understand me not that tell me so
 i do not speak of flight of fear of death
 but dare all imminence that gods and men
 address their dangers in hector is gone
 who shall tell priam so or hecuba
 let him that will a screechowl aye be call'd
 go in to troy and say there hector's dead
 there is a word will priam turn to stone
 make wells and niobes of the maids and wives
 cold statues of the youth and in a word
 scare troy out of itself but march away
 hector is dead there is no more to say
 stay yet you vile abominable tents
 thus proudly pight upon our phrygian plains
 let titan rise as early as he dare
 i'll through and through you and thou greatsized coward
 no space of earth shall sunder our two hates
 i'll haunt thee like a wicked conscience still
 that mouldeth goblins swift as frenzy's thoughts
 strike a free march to troy with comfort go
 hope of revenge shall hide our inward woe
