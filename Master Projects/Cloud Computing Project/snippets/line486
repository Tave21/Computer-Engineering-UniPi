 the dove pursues the griffin the mild hind
 makes speed to catch the tiger bootless speed
 when cowardice pursues and valour flies
demetrius i will not stay thy questions let me go
 or if thou follow me do not believe
 but i shall do thee mischief in the wood
helena ay in the temple in the town the field
 you do me mischief fie demetrius
 your wrongs do set a scandal on my sex
 we cannot fight for love as men may do
 we should be wood and were not made to woo
 exit demetrius
 i'll follow thee and make a heaven of hell
 to die upon the hand i love so well
 exit
oberon fare thee well nymph ere he do leave this grove
 thou shalt fly him and he shall seek thy love
 reenter puck
 hast thou the flower there welcome wanderer
puck ay there it is
oberon i pray thee give it me
 i know a bank where the wild thyme blows
 where oxlips and the nodding violet grows
 quite overcanopied with luscious woodbine
 with sweet muskroses and with eglantine
 there sleeps titania sometime of the night
 lull'd in these flowers with dances and delight
 and there the snake throws her enamell'd skin
 weed wide enough to wrap a fairy in
 and with the juice of this i'll streak her eyes
 and make her full of hateful fantasies
 take thou some of it and seek through this grove
 a sweet athenian lady is in love
 with a disdainful youth anoint his eyes
 but do it when the next thing he espies
 may be the lady thou shalt know the man
 by the athenian garments he hath on
 effect it with some care that he may prove
 more fond on her than she upon her love
 and look thou meet me ere the first cock crow
puck fear not my lord your servant shall do so
 exeunt
 a midsummer night's dream
act ii
scene ii another part of the wood
 enter titania with her train
titania come now a roundel and a fairy song
 then for the third part of a minute hence
 some to kill cankers in the muskrose buds
 some war with reremice for their leathern wings
 to make my small elves coats and some keep back
 the clamorous owl that nightly hoots and wonders
 at our quaint spirits sing me now asleep
 then to your offices and let me rest
 the fairies sing
 you spotted snakes with double tongue
 thorny hedgehogs be not seen
 newts and blindworms do no wrong
 come not near our fairy queen
 philomel with melody
 sing in our sweet lullaby
 lulla lulla lullaby lulla lulla lullaby
 never harm
 nor spell nor charm
 come our lovely lady nigh
 so good night with lullaby
 weaving spiders come not here
 hence you longlegg'd spinners hence
 beetles black approach not near
 worm nor snail do no offence
 philomel with melody &c
fairy hence away now all is well
 one aloof stand sentinel
 exeunt fairies titania sleeps
 enter oberon and squeezes the flower on titania's eyelids
oberon what thou seest when thou dost wake
 do it for thy truelove take
 love and languish for his sake
 be it ounce or cat or bear
 pard or boar with bristled hair
 in thy eye that shall appear
 when thou wakest it is thy dear
 wake when some vile thing is near
 exit
 enter lysander and hermia
lysander fair love you faint with wandering in the wood
 and to speak troth i have forgot our way
 we'll rest us hermia if you think it good
 and tarry for the comfort of the day
hermia be it so lysander find you out a bed
 for i upon this bank will rest my head
lysander one turf shall serve as pillow for us both
 one heart one bed two bosoms and one troth
hermia nay good lysander for my sake my dear
 lie further off yet do not lie so near
lysander o take the sense sweet of my innocence
 love takes the meaning in love's conference
 i mean that my heart unto yours is knit
 so that but one heart we can make of it
 two bosoms interchained with an oath
 so then two bosoms and a single troth
 then by your side no bedroom me deny
 for lying so hermia i do not lie
hermia lysander riddles very prettily
 now much beshrew my manners and my pride
 if hermia meant to say lysander lied
 but gentle friend for love and courtesy
 lie further off in human modesty
 such separation as may well be said
 becomes a virtuous bachelor and a maid
 so far be distant and good night sweet friend
 thy love ne'er alter till thy sweet life end
lysander amen amen to that fair prayer say i
 and then end life when i end loyalty
 here is my bed sleep give thee all his rest
hermia with half that wish the wisher's eyes be press'd
 they sleep
 enter puck
puck through the forest have i gone
 but athenian found i none
 on whose eyes i might approve
 this flower's force in stirring love
 night and silencewho is here
 weeds of athens he doth wear
 this is he my master said
 despised the athenian maid
 and here the maiden sleeping sound
 on the dank and dirty ground
 pretty soul she durst not lie
 near this lacklove this killcourtesy
 churl upon thy eyes i throw
 all the power this charm doth owe
 when thou wakest let love forbid
 sleep his seat on thy eyelid
 so awake when i am gone
 for i must now to oberon
 exit
 enter demetrius and helena running
helena stay though thou kill me sweet demetrius
demetrius i charge thee hence and do not haunt me thus
helena o wilt thou darkling leave me do not so
demetrius stay on thy peril i alone will go
 exit
helena o i am out of breath in this fond chase
 the more my prayer the lesser is my grace
 happy is hermia wheresoe'er she lies
 for she hath blessed and attractive eyes
 how came her eyes so bright not with salt tears
 if so my eyes are oftener wash'd than hers
 no no i am as ugly as a bear
 for beasts that meet me run away for fear
 therefore no marvel though demetrius
 do as a monster fly my presence thus
 what wicked and dissembling glass of mine
 made me compare with hermia's sphery eyne
 but who is here lysander on the ground
 dead or asleep i see no blood no wound
 lysander if you live good sir awake
lysander awaking and run through fire i will for thy sweet sake
 transparent helena nature shows art
 that through thy bosom makes me see thy heart
 where is demetrius o how fit a word
 is that vile name to perish on my sword
helena do not say so lysander say not so
 what though he love your hermia lord what though
 yet hermia still loves you then be content
lysander content with hermia no i do repent
 the tedious minutes i with her have spent
 not hermia but helena i love
 who will not change a raven for a dove
 the will of man is by his reason sway'd
 and reason says you are the worthier maid
 things growing are not ripe until their season
 so i being young till now ripe not to reason
 and touching now the point of human skill
 reason becomes the marshal to my will
 and leads me to your eyes where i o'erlook
 love's stories written in love's richest book
helena wherefore was i to this keen mockery born
 when at your hands did i deserve this scorn
 is't not enough is't not enough young man
 that i did never no nor never can
 deserve a sweet look from demetrius eye
 but you must flout my insufficiency
 good troth you do me wrong good sooth you do
 in such disdainful manner me to woo
 but fare you well perforce i must confess
 i thought you lord of more true gentleness
 o that a lady of one man refused
 should of another therefore be abused
 exit
lysander she sees not hermia hermia sleep thou there
 and never mayst thou come lysander near
 for as a surfeit of the sweetest things
 the deepest loathing to the stomach brings
 or as tie heresies that men do leave
 are hated most of those they did deceive
 so thou my surfeit and my heresy
 of all be hated but the most of me
 and all my powers address your love and might
