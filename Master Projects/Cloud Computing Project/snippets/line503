 much ado about nothing
act iv
scene i a church
 enter don pedro don john leonato friar francis
 claudio benedick hero beatrice and attendants
leonato come friar francis be brief only to the plain
 form of marriage and you shall recount their
 particular duties afterwards
friar francis you come hither my lord to marry this lady
claudio no
leonato to be married to her friar you come to marry her
friar francis lady you come hither to be married to this count
hero i do
friar francis if either of you know any inward impediment why you
 should not be conjoined charge you on your souls
 to utter it
claudio know you any hero
hero none my lord
friar francis know you any count
leonato i dare make his answer none
claudio o what men dare do what men may do what men daily
 do not knowing what they do
benedick how now interjections why then some be of
 laughing as ah ha he
claudio stand thee by friar father by your leave
 will you with free and unconstrained soul
 give me this maid your daughter
leonato as freely son as god did give her me
claudio and what have i to give you back whose worth
 may counterpoise this rich and precious gift
don pedro nothing unless you render her again
claudio sweet prince you learn me noble thankfulness
 there leonato take her back again
 give not this rotten orange to your friend
 she's but the sign and semblance of her honour
 behold how like a maid she blushes here
 o what authority and show of truth
 can cunning sin cover itself withal
 comes not that blood as modest evidence
 to witness simple virtue would you not swear
 all you that see her that she were a maid
 by these exterior shows but she is none
 she knows the heat of a luxurious bed
 her blush is guiltiness not modesty
leonato what do you mean my lord
claudio not to be married
 not to knit my soul to an approved wanton
leonato dear my lord if you in your own proof
 have vanquish'd the resistance of her youth
 and made defeat of her virginity
claudio i know what you would say if i have known her
 you will say she did embrace me as a husband
 and so extenuate the forehand sin
 no leonato
 i never tempted her with word too large
 but as a brother to his sister show'd
 bashful sincerity and comely love
hero and seem'd i ever otherwise to you
claudio out on thee seeming i will write against it
 you seem to me as dian in her orb
 as chaste as is the bud ere it be blown
 but you are more intemperate in your blood
 than venus or those pamper'd animals
 that rage in savage sensuality
hero is my lord well that he doth speak so wide
leonato sweet prince why speak not you
don pedro what should i speak
 i stand dishonour'd that have gone about
 to link my dear friend to a common stale
leonato are these things spoken or do i but dream
don john sir they are spoken and these things are true
benedick this looks not like a nuptial
hero true o god
claudio leonato stand i here
 is this the prince is this the prince's brother
 is this face hero's are our eyes our own
leonato all this is so but what of this my lord
claudio let me but move one question to your daughter
 and by that fatherly and kindly power
 that you have in her bid her answer truly
leonato i charge thee do so as thou art my child
hero o god defend me how am i beset
 what kind of catechising call you this
claudio to make you answer truly to your name
hero is it not hero who can blot that name
 with any just reproach
claudio marry that can hero
 hero itself can blot out hero's virtue
 what man was he talk'd with you yesternight
 out at your window betwixt twelve and one
 now if you are a maid answer to this
hero i talk'd with no man at that hour my lord
don pedro why then are you no maiden leonato
 i am sorry you must hear upon mine honour
 myself my brother and this grieved count
 did see her hear her at that hour last night
 talk with a ruffian at her chamberwindow
 who hath indeed most like a liberal villain
 confess'd the vile encounters they have had
 a thousand times in secret
don john fie fie they are not to be named my lord
 not to be spoke of
 there is not chastity enough in language
 without offence to utter them thus pretty lady
 i am sorry for thy much misgovernment
claudio o hero what a hero hadst thou been
 if half thy outward graces had been placed
 about thy thoughts and counsels of thy heart
 but fare thee well most foul most fair farewell
 thou pure impiety and impious purity
 for thee i'll lock up all the gates of love
 and on my eyelids shall conjecture hang
 to turn all beauty into thoughts of harm
 and never shall it more be gracious
leonato hath no man's dagger here a point for me
 hero swoons
beatrice why how now cousin wherefore sink you down
don john come let us go these things come thus to light
 smother her spirits up
 exeunt don pedro don john and claudio
benedick how doth the lady
beatrice dead i think help uncle
 hero why hero uncle signior benedick friar
leonato o fate take not away thy heavy hand
 death is the fairest cover for her shame
 that may be wish'd for
beatrice how now cousin hero
friar francis have comfort lady
leonato dost thou look up
friar francis yea wherefore should she not
leonato wherefore why doth not every earthly thing
 cry shame upon her could she here deny
 the story that is printed in her blood
 do not live hero do not ope thine eyes
 for did i think thou wouldst not quickly die
 thought i thy spirits were stronger than thy shames
 myself would on the rearward of reproaches
 strike at thy life grieved i i had but one
 chid i for that at frugal nature's frame
 o one too much by thee why had i one
 why ever wast thou lovely in my eyes
 why had i not with charitable hand
 took up a beggar's issue at my gates
 who smirch'd thus and mired with infamy
 i might have said no part of it is mine
 this shame derives itself from unknown loins'
 but mine and mine i loved and mine i praised
 and mine that i was proud on mine so much
 that i myself was to myself not mine
 valuing of herwhy she o she is fallen
 into a pit of ink that the wide sea
 hath drops too few to wash her clean again
 and salt too little which may season give
 to her foultainted flesh
benedick sir sir be patient
 for my part i am so attired in wonder
 i know not what to say
beatrice o on my soul my cousin is belied
benedick lady were you her bedfellow last night
beatrice no truly not although until last night
 i have this twelvemonth been her bedfellow
leonato confirm'd confirm'd o that is stronger made
 which was before barr'd up with ribs of iron
 would the two princes lie and claudio lie
 who loved her so that speaking of her foulness
 wash'd it with tears hence from her let her die
friar francis hear me a little for i have only been
 silent so long and given way unto
 this course of fortune 
 by noting of the lady i have mark'd
 a thousand blushing apparitions
 to start into her face a thousand innocent shames
 in angel whiteness beat away those blushes
 and in her eye there hath appear'd a fire
 to burn the errors that these princes hold
 against her maiden truth call me a fool
 trust not my reading nor my observations
 which with experimental seal doth warrant
 the tenor of my book trust not my age
 my reverence calling nor divinity
 if this sweet lady lie not guiltless here
 under some biting error
leonato friar it cannot be
 thou seest that all the grace that she hath left
 is that she will not add to her damnation
 a sin of perjury she not denies it
 why seek'st thou then to cover with excuse
 that which appears in proper nakedness
friar francis lady what man is he you are accused of
hero they know that do accuse me i know none
 if i know more of any man alive
 than that which maiden modesty doth warrant
