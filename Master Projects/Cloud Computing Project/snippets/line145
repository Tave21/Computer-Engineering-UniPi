2cor119 and when i was present with you and wanted i was chargeable to no man for that which was lacking to me the brethren which came from macedonia supplied and in all things i have kept myself from being burdensome unto you and so will i keep myself
2cor1110 as the truth of christ is in me no man shall stop me of this boasting in the regions of achaia
2cor1111 wherefore because i love you not god knoweth
2cor1112 but what i do that i will do that i may cut off occasion from them which desire occasion that wherein they glory they may be found even as we
2cor1113 for such are false apostles deceitful workers transforming themselves into the apostles of christ
2cor1114 and no marvel for satan himself is transformed into an angel of light
2cor1115 therefore it is no great thing if his ministers also be transformed as the ministers of righteousness whose end shall be according to their works
2cor1116 i say again let no man think me a fool if otherwise yet as a fool receive me that i may boast myself a little
2cor1117 that which i speak i speak it not after the lord but as it were foolishly in this confidence of boasting
2cor1118 seeing that many glory after the flesh i will glory also
2cor1119 for ye suffer fools gladly seeing ye yourselves are wise
2cor1120 for ye suffer if a man bring you into bondage if a man devour you if a man take of you if a man exalt himself if a man smite you on the face
2cor1121 i speak as concerning reproach as though we had been weak howbeit whereinsoever any is bold i speak foolishly i am bold also
2cor1122 are they hebrews so am i are they israelites so am i are they the seed of abraham so am i
2cor1123 are they ministers of christ i speak as a fool i am more in labours more abundant in stripes above measure in prisons more frequent in deaths oft
2cor1124 of the jews five times received i forty stripes save one
2cor1125 thrice was i beaten with rods once was i stoned thrice i suffered shipwreck a night and a day i have been in the deep
2cor1126 in journeyings often in perils of waters in perils of robbers in perils by mine own countrymen in perils by the heathen in perils in the city in perils in the wilderness in perils in the sea in perils among false brethren
2cor1127 in weariness and painfulness in watchings often in hunger and thirst in fastings often in cold and nakedness
2cor1128 beside those things that are without that which cometh upon me daily the care of all the churches
2cor1129 who is weak and i am not weak who is offended and i burn not
2cor1130 if i must needs glory i will glory of the things which concern mine infirmities
2cor1131 the god and father of our lord jesus christ which is blessed for evermore knoweth that i lie not
2cor1132 in damascus the governor under aretas the king kept the city of the damascenes with a garrison desirous to apprehend me
2cor1133 and through a window in a basket was i let down by the wall and escaped his hands
2cor121 it is not expedient for me doubtless to glory i will come to visions and revelations of the lord
2cor122 i knew a man in christ above fourteen years ago whether in the body i cannot tell or whether out of the body i cannot tell god knoweth such an one caught up to the third heaven
2cor123 and i knew such a man whether in the body or out of the body i cannot tell god knoweth
2cor124 how that he was caught up into paradise and heard unspeakable words which it is not lawful for a man to utter
2cor125 of such an one will i glory yet of myself i will not glory but in mine infirmities
2cor126 for though i would desire to glory i shall not be a fool for i will say the truth but now i forbear lest any man should think of me above that which he seeth me to be or that he heareth of me
2cor127 and lest i should be exalted above measure through the abundance of the revelations there was given to me a thorn in the flesh the messenger of satan to buffet me lest i should be exalted above measure
2cor128 for this thing i besought the lord thrice that it might depart from me
2cor129 and he said unto me my grace is sufficient for thee for my strength is made perfect in weakness most gladly therefore will i rather glory in my infirmities that the power of christ may rest upon me
2cor1210 therefore i take pleasure in infirmities in reproaches in necessities in persecutions in distresses for christ's sake for when i am weak then am i strong
2cor1211 i am become a fool in glorying ye have compelled me for i ought to have been commended of you for in nothing am i behind the very chiefest apostles though i be nothing
2cor1212 truly the signs of an apostle were wrought among you in all patience in signs and wonders and mighty deeds
2cor1213 for what is it wherein ye were inferior to other churches except it be that i myself was not burdensome to you forgive me this wrong
2cor1214 behold the third time i am ready to come to you and i will not be burdensome to you for i seek not yours but you for the children ought not to lay up for the parents but the parents for the children
2cor1215 and i will very gladly spend and be spent for you though the more abundantly i love you the less i be loved
2cor1216 but be it so i did not burden you nevertheless being crafty i caught you with guile
2cor1217 did i make a gain of you by any of them whom i sent unto you
2cor1218 i desired titus and with him i sent a brother did titus make a gain of you walked we not in the same spirit walked we not in the same steps
2cor1219 again think ye that we excuse ourselves unto you we speak before god in christ but we do all things dearly beloved for your edifying
2cor1220 for i fear lest when i come i shall not find you such as i would and that i shall be found unto you such as ye would not lest there be debates envyings wraths strifes backbitings whisperings swellings tumults
2cor1221 and lest when i come again my god will humble me among you and that i shall bewail many which have sinned already and have not repented of the uncleanness and fornication and lasciviousness which they have committed
2cor131 this is the third time i am coming to you in the mouth of two or three witnesses shall every word be established
2cor132 i told you before and foretell you as if i were present the second time and being absent now i write to them which heretofore have sinned and to all other that if i come again i will not spare
2cor133 since ye seek a proof of christ speaking in me which to youward is not weak but is mighty in you
2cor134 for though he was crucified through weakness yet he liveth by the power of god for we also are weak in him but we shall live with him by the power of god toward you
2cor135 examine yourselves whether ye be in the faith prove your own selves know ye not your own selves how that jesus christ is in you except ye be reprobates
2cor136 but i trust that ye shall know that we are not reprobates
2cor137 now i pray to god that ye do no evil not that we should appear approved but that ye should do that which is honest though we be as reprobates
2cor138 for we can do nothing against the truth but for the truth
2cor139 for we are glad when we are weak and ye are strong and this also we wish even your perfection
2cor1310 therefore i write these things being absent lest being present i should use sharpness according to the power which the lord hath given me to edification and not to destruction
2cor1311 finally brethren farewell be perfect be of good comfort be of one mind live in peace and the god of love and peace shall be with you
2cor1312 greet one another with an holy kiss
2cor1313 all the saints salute you
2cor1314 the grace of the lord jesus christ and the love of god and the communion of the holy ghost be with you all amen
paul an apostle not of men neither by man but by jesus christ and god the father who raised him from the dead
and all the brethren which are with me unto the churches of galatia
grace be to you and peace from god the father and from our lord jesus christ
who gave himself for our sins that he might deliver us from this present evil world according to the will of god and our father
to whom be glory for ever and ever amen
i marvel that ye are so soon removed from him that called you into the grace of christ unto another gospel
which is not another but there be some that trouble you and would pervert the gospel of christ
but though we or an angel from heaven preach any other gospel unto you than that which we have preached unto you let him be accursed
as we said before so say i now again if any man preach any other gospel unto you than that ye have received let him be accursed
for do i now persuade men or god or do i seek to please men for if i yet pleased men i should not be the servant of christ
but i certify you brethren that the gospel which was preached of me is not after man
for i neither received it of man neither was i taught it but by the revelation of jesus christ
for ye have heard of my conversation in time past in the jews religion how that beyond measure i persecuted the church of god and wasted it
and profited in the jews religion above many my equals in mine own nation being more exceedingly zealous of the traditions of my fathers
but when it pleased god who separated me from my mother's womb and called me by his grace
to reveal his son in me that i might preach him among the heathen immediately i conferred not with flesh and blood
neither went i up to jerusalem to them which were apostles before me but i went into arabia and returned again unto damascus
then after three years i went up to jerusalem to see peter and abode with him fifteen days
but other of the apostles saw i none save james the lord's brother
now the things which i write unto you behold before god i lie not
afterwards i came into the regions of syria and cilicia
and was unknown by face unto the churches of judaea which were in christ
but they had heard only that he which persecuted us in times past now preacheth the faith which once he destroyed
and they glorified god in me
then fourteen years after i went up again to jerusalem with barnabas and took titus with me also
and i went up by revelation and communicated unto them that gospel which i preach among the gentiles but privately to them which were of reputation lest by any means i should run or had run in vain
but neither titus who was with me being a greek was compelled to be circumcised
and that because of false brethren unawares brought in who came in privily to spy out our liberty which we have in christ jesus that they might bring us into bondage
to whom we gave place by subjection no not for an hour that the truth of the gospel might continue with you
but of these who seemed to be somewhat whatsoever they were it maketh no matter to me god accepteth no man's person for they who seemed to be somewhat in conference added nothing to me
but contrariwise when they saw that the gospel of the uncircumcision was committed unto me as the gospel of the circumcision was unto peter
for he that wrought effectually in peter to the apostleship of the circumcision the same was mighty in me toward the gentiles
and when james cephas and john who seemed to be pillars perceived the grace that was given unto me they gave to me and barnabas the right hands of fellowship that we should go unto the heathen and they unto the circumcision
only they would that we should remember the poor the same which i also was forward to do
but when peter was come to antioch i withstood him to the face because he was to be blamed
for before that certain came from james he did eat with the gentiles but when they were come he withdrew and separated himself fearing them which were of the circumcision
and the other jews dissembled likewise with him insomuch that barnabas also was carried away with their dissimulation
but when i saw that they walked not uprightly according to the truth of the gospel i said unto peter before them all if thou being a jew livest after the manner of gentiles and not as do the jews why compellest thou the gentiles to live as do the jews
we who are jews by nature and not sinners of the gentiles
knowing that a man is not justified by the works of the law but by the faith of jesus christ even we have believed in jesus christ that we might be justified by the faith of christ and not by the works of the law for by the works of the law shall no flesh be justified
but if while we seek to be justified by christ we ourselves also are found sinners is therefore christ the minister of sin god forbid
for if i build again the things which i destroyed i make myself a transgressor
for i through the law am dead to the law that i might live unto god
i am crucified with christ nevertheless i live yet not i but christ liveth in me and the life which i now live in the flesh i live by the faith of the son of god who loved me and gave himself for me
i do not frustrate the grace of god for if righteousness come by the law then christ is dead in vain
o foolish galatians who hath bewitched you that ye should not obey the truth before whose eyes jesus christ hath been evidently set forth crucified among you
this only would i learn of you received ye the spirit by the works of the law or by the hearing of faith
are ye so foolish having begun in the spirit are ye now made perfect by the flesh
have ye suffered so many things in vain if it be yet in vain
he therefore that ministereth to you the spirit and worketh miracles among you doeth he it by the works of the law or by the hearing of faith
even as abraham believed god and it was accounted to him for righteousness
know ye therefore that they which are of faith the same are the children of abraham
and the scripture foreseeing that god would justify the heathen through faith preached before the gospel unto abraham saying in thee shall all nations be blessed
so then they which be of faith are blessed with faithful abraham
for as many as are of the works of the law are under the curse for it is written cursed is every one that continueth not in all things which are written in the book of the law to do them
but that no man is justified by the law in the sight of god it is evident for the just shall live by faith
and the law is not of faith but the man that doeth them shall live in them
christ hath redeemed us from the curse of the law being made a curse for us for it is written cursed is every one that hangeth on a tree
that the blessing of abraham might come on the gentiles through jesus christ that we might receive the promise of the spirit through faith
brethren i speak after the manner of men though it be but a man's covenant yet if it be confirmed no man disannulleth or addeth thereto
now to abraham and his seed were the promises made he saith not and to seeds as of many but as of one and to thy seed which is christ
and this i say that the covenant that was confirmed before of god in christ the law which was four hundred and thirty years after cannot disannul that it should make the promise of none effect
for if the inheritance be of the law it is no more of promise but god gave it to abraham by promise
wherefore then serveth the law it was added because of transgressions till the seed should come to whom the promise was made and it was ordained by angels in the hand of a mediator
now a mediator is not a mediator of one but god is one
is the law then against the promises of god god forbid for if there had been a law given which could have given life verily righteousness should have been by the law
but the scripture hath concluded all under sin that the promise by faith of jesus christ might be given to them that believe
but before faith came we were kept under the law shut up unto the faith which should afterwards be revealed
wherefore the law was our schoolmaster to bring us unto christ that we might be justified by faith
but after that faith is come we are no longer under a schoolmaster
for ye are all the children of god by faith in christ jesus
for as many of you as have been baptized into christ have put on christ
there is neither jew nor greek there is neither bond nor free there is neither male nor female for ye are all one in christ jesus
and if ye be christ's then are ye abraham's seed and heirs according to the promise
now i say that the heir as long as he is a child differeth nothing from a servant though he be lord of all
but is under tutors and governors until the time appointed of the father
even so we when we were children were in bondage under the elements of the world
but when the fulness of the time was come god sent forth his son made of a woman made under the law
to redeem them that were under the law that we might receive the adoption of sons
and because ye are sons god hath sent forth the spirit of his son into your hearts crying abba father
wherefore thou art no more a servant but a son and if a son then an heir of god through christ
howbeit then when ye knew not god ye did service unto them which by nature are no gods
but now after that ye have known god or rather are known of god how turn ye again to the weak and beggarly elements whereunto ye desire again to be in bondage
ye observe days and months and times and years
i am afraid of you lest i have bestowed upon you labour in vain
brethren i beseech you be as i am for i am as ye are ye have not injured me at all
ye know how through infirmity of the flesh i preached the gospel unto you at the first
and my temptation which was in my flesh ye despised not nor rejected but received me as an angel of god even as christ jesus
where is then the blessedness ye spake of for i bear you record that if it had been possible ye would have plucked out your own eyes and have given them to me
am i therefore become your enemy because i tell you the truth
they zealously affect you but not well yea they would exclude you that ye might affect them
but it is good to be zealously affected always in a good thing and not only when i am present with you
my little children of whom i travail in birth again until christ be formed in you
i desire to be present with you now and to change my voice for i stand in doubt of you
tell me ye that desire to be under the law do ye not hear the law
for it is written that abraham had two sons the one by a bondmaid the other by a freewoman
but he who was of the bondwoman was born after the flesh but he of the freewoman was by promise
which things are an allegory for these are the two covenants the one from the mount sinai which gendereth to bondage which is agar
for this agar is mount sinai in arabia and answereth to jerusalem which now is and is in bondage with her children
but jerusalem which is above is free which is the mother of us all
for it is written rejoice thou barren that bearest not break forth and cry thou that travailest not for the desolate hath many more children than she which hath an husband
now we brethren as isaac was are the children of promise
but as then he that was born after the flesh persecuted him that was born after the spirit even so it is now
nevertheless what saith the scripture cast out the bondwoman and her son for the son of the bondwoman shall not be heir with the son of the freewoman
so then brethren we are not children of the bondwoman but of the free
stand fast therefore in the liberty wherewith christ hath made us free and be not entangled again with the yoke of bondage
behold i paul say unto you that if ye be circumcised christ shall profit you nothing
for i testify again to every man that is circumcised that he is a debtor to do the whole law
christ is become of no effect unto you whosoever of you are justified by the law ye are fallen from grace
for we through the spirit wait for the hope of righteousness by faith
for in jesus christ neither circumcision availeth any thing nor uncircumcision but faith which worketh by love
ye did run well who did hinder you that ye should not obey the truth
this persuasion cometh not of him that calleth you
a little leaven leaveneth the whole lump
i have confidence in you through the lord that ye will be none otherwise minded but he that troubleth you shall bear his judgment whosoever he be
and i brethren if i yet preach circumcision why do i yet suffer persecution then is the offence of the cross ceased
i would they were even cut off which trouble you
for brethren ye have been called unto liberty only use not liberty for an occasion to the flesh but by love serve one another
for all the law is fulfilled in one word even in this thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself
but if ye bite and devour one another take heed that ye be not consumed one of another
this i say then walk in the spirit and ye shall not fulfil the lust of the flesh
for the flesh lusteth against the spirit and the spirit against the flesh and these are contrary the one to the other so that ye cannot do the things that ye would
but if ye be led of the spirit ye are not under the law
now the works of the flesh are manifest which are these adultery fornication uncleanness lasciviousness
idolatry witchcraft hatred variance emulations wrath strife seditions heresies
envyings murders drunkenness revellings and such like of the which i tell you before as i have also told you in time past that they which do such things shall not inherit the kingdom of god
but the fruit of the spirit is love joy peace longsuffering gentleness goodness faith
meekness temperance against such there is no law
and they that are christ's have crucified the flesh with the affections and lusts
if we live in the spirit let us also walk in the spirit
let us not be desirous of vain glory provoking one another envying one another
brethren if a man be overtaken in a fault ye which are spiritual restore such an one in the spirit of meekness considering thyself lest thou also be tempted
bear ye one another's burdens and so fulfil the law of christ
for if a man think himself to be something when he is nothing he deceiveth himself
but let every man prove his own work and then shall he have rejoicing in himself alone and not in another
for every man shall bear his own burden
let him that is taught in the word communicate unto him that teacheth in all good things
be not deceived god is not mocked for whatsoever a man soweth that shall he also reap
for he that soweth to his flesh shall of the flesh reap corruption but he that soweth to the spirit shall of the spirit reap life everlasting
and let us not be weary in well doing for in due season we shall reap if we faint not
