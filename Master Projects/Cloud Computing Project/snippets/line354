she bade good night that kept my rest away
and daff'd me to a cabin hang'd with care
to descant on the doubts of my decay
'farewell quoth she and come again tomorrow'
fare well i could not for i supp'd with sorrow
yet at my parting sweetly did she smile
in scorn or friendship nill i construe whether
't may be she joy'd to jest at my exile
't may be again to make me wander thither
'wander a word for shadows like myself
as take the pain but cannot pluck the pelf
xv
lord how mine eyes throw gazes to the east
my heart doth charge the watch the morning rise
doth cite each moving sense from idle rest
not daring trust the office of mine eyes
while philomela sits and sings i sit and mark
and wish her lays were tuned like the lark
for she doth welcome daylight with her ditty
and drives away dark dismaldreaming night
the night so pack'd i post unto my pretty
heart hath his hope and eyes their wished sight
sorrow changed to solace solace mix'd with sorrow
for why she sigh'd and bade me come tomorrow
were i with her the night would post too soon
but now are minutes added to the hours
to spite me now each minute seems a moon
yet not for me shine sun to succor flowers
pack night peep day good day of night now borrow
short night tonight and length thyself tomorrow
 sonnets to sundry notes of music

it was a lording's daughter the fairest one of three
that liked of her master as well as well might be
till looking on an englishman the fair'st that eye could see
her fancy fell aturning
long was the combat doubtful that love with love did fight
to leave the master loveless or kill the gallant knight
to put in practise either alas it was a spite
unto the silly damsel
but one must be refused more mickle was the pain
that nothing could be used to turn them both to gain
for of the two the trusty knight was wounded with disdain
alas she could not help it
thus art with arms contending was victor of the day
which by a gift of learning did bear the maid away
then lullaby the learned man hath got the lady gay
for now my song is ended
xvii
on a day alack the day
love whose month was ever may
spied a blossom passing fair
playing in the wanton air
through the velvet leaves the wind
all unseen gan passage find
that the lover sick to death
wish'd himself the heaven's breath
'air quoth he thy cheeks may blow
air would i might triumph so
but alas my hand hath sworn
ne'er to pluck thee from thy thorn
vow alack for youth unmeet
youth so apt to pluck a sweet
thou for whom jove would swear
juno but an ethiope were
and deny himself for jove
turning mortal for thy love'
xviii
my flocks feed not
my ewes breed not
my rams speed not
all is amiss
love's denying
faith's defying
heart's renying
causer of this
all my merry jigs are quite forgot
all my lady's love is lost god wot
where her faith was firmly fix'd in love
there a nay is placed without remove
one silly cross
wrought all my loss
o frowning fortune cursed fickle dame
for now i see
inconstancy
more in women than in men remain
in black mourn i
all fears scorn i
love hath forlorn me
living in thrall
heart is bleeding
all help needing
o cruel speeding
fraughted with gall
my shepherd's pipe can sound no deal
my wether's bell rings doleful knell
my curtail dog that wont to have play'd
plays not at all but seems afraid
my sighs so deep
procure to weep
in howling wise to see my doleful plight
how sighs resound
through heartless ground
like a thousand vanquish'd men in bloody fight
clear wells spring not
sweet birds sing not
green plants bring not
forth their dye
herds stand weeping
flocks all sleeping
nymphs back peeping
fearfully
all our pleasure known to us poor swains
all our merry meetings on the plains
all our evening sport from us is fled
all our love is lost for love is dead
farewell sweet lass
thy like ne'er was
for a sweet content the cause of all my moan
poor corydon
must live alone
other help for him i see that there is none
xix
when as thine eye hath chose the dame
and stall'd the deer that thou shouldst strike
let reason rule things worthy blame
as well as fancy partial might
take counsel of some wiser head
neither too young nor yet unwed
and when thou comest thy tale to tell
smooth not thy tongue with filed talk
lest she some subtle practise smell
a cripple soon can find a halt
but plainly say thou lovest her well
and set thy person forth to sell
what though her frowning brows be bent
her cloudy looks will calm ere night
and then too late she will repent
that thus dissembled her delight
and twice desire ere it be day
that which with scorn she put away
what though she strive to try her strength
and ban and brawl and say thee nay
her feeble force will yield at length
when craft hath taught her thus to say
'had women been so strong as men
in faith you had not had it then'
and to her will frame all thy ways
spare not to spend and chiefly there
where thy desert may merit praise
by ringing in thy lady's ear
the strongest castle tower and town
the golden bullet beats it down
serve always with assured trust
and in thy suit be humble true
unless thy lady prove unjust
press never thou to choose anew
when time shall serve be thou not slack
to proffer though she put thee back
the wiles and guiles that women work
dissembled with an outward show
the tricks and toys that in them lurk
the cock that treads them shall not know
have you not heard it said full oft
a woman's nay doth stand for nought
think women still to strive with men
to sin and never for to saint
there is no heaven by holy then
when time with age doth them attaint
were kisses all the joys in bed
one woman would another wed
but soft enough too much i fear
lest that my mistress hear my song
she will not stick to round me i the ear
to teach my tongue to be so long
yet will she blush here be it said
to hear her secrets so bewray'd
xx
live with me and be my love
and we will all the pleasures prove
that hills and valleys dales and fields
and all the craggy mountains yields
there will we sit upon the rocks
and see the shepherds feed their flocks
by shallow rivers by whose falls
melodious birds sing madrigals
there will i make thee a bed of roses
with a thousand fragrant posies
a cap of flowers and a kirtle
embroider'd all with leaves of myrtle
a belt of straw and ivy buds
with coral clasps and amber studs
and if these pleasures may thee move
then live with me and be my love
love's answer
if that the world and love were young
and truth in every shepherd's tongue
these pretty pleasures might me move
to live with thee and be thy love
xxi
