 twixt hour and hour
pisanio one score twixt sun and sun
 madam s enough for you
 aside
 and too much too
imogen why one that rode to's execution man
 could never go so slow i have heard of
 riding wagers
 where horses have been nimbler than the sands
 that run i the clock's behalf but this is foolery
 go bid my woman feign a sickness say
 she'll home to her father and provide me presently
 a ridingsuit no costlier than would fit
 a franklin's housewife
pisanio madam you're best consider
imogen i see before me man nor here nor here
 nor what ensues but have a fog in them
 that i cannot look through away i prithee
 do as i bid thee there's no more to say
 accessible is none but milford way

act iii
scene iii wales a mountainous country with a cave
 enter from the cave belarius guiderius
 and arviragus following
belarius a goodly day not to keep house with such
 whose roof's as low as ours stoop boys this gate
 instructs you how to adore the heavens and bows you
 to a morning's holy office the gates of monarchs
 are arch'd so high that giants may jet through
 and keep their impious turbans on without
 good morrow to the sun hail thou fair heaven
 we house i the rock yet use thee not so hardly
 as prouder livers do
guiderius hail heaven
arviragus hail heaven
belarius now for our mountain sport up to yond hill
 your legs are young i'll tread these flats consider
 when you above perceive me like a crow
 that it is place which lessens and sets off
 and you may then revolve what tales i have told you
 of courts of princes of the tricks in war
 this service is not service so being done
 but being so allow'd to apprehend thus
 draws us a profit from all things we see
 and often to our comfort shall we find
 the sharded beetle in a safer hold
 than is the fullwing'd eagle o this life
 is nobler than attending for a cheque
 richer than doing nothing for a bauble
 prouder than rustling in unpaidfor silk
 such gain the cap of him that makes em fine
 yet keeps his book uncross'd no life to ours
guiderius out of your proof you speak we poor unfledged
 have never wing'd from view o the nest nor know not
 what air's from home haply this life is best
 if quiet life be best sweeter to you
 that have a sharper known well corresponding
 with your stiff age but unto us it is
 a cell of ignorance travelling abed
 a prison for a debtor that not dares
 to stride a limit
arviragus what should we speak of
 when we are old as you when we shall hear
 the rain and wind beat dark december how
 in this our pinching cave shall we discourse
 the freezing hours away we have seen nothing
 we are beastly subtle as the fox for prey
 like warlike as the wolf for what we eat
 our valour is to chase what flies our cage
 we make a quire as doth the prison'd bird
 and sing our bondage freely
belarius how you speak
 did you but know the city's usuries
 and felt them knowingly the art o the court
 as hard to leave as keep whose top to climb
 is certain falling or so slippery that
 the fear's as bad as falling the toil o the war
 a pain that only seems to seek out danger
 i the name of fame and honour which dies i'
 the search
 and hath as oft a slanderous epitaph
 as record of fair act nay many times
 doth ill deserve by doing well what's worse
 must court'sy at the censureo boys this story
 the world may read in me my body's mark'd
 with roman swords and my report was once
 first with the best of note cymbeline loved me
 and when a soldier was the theme my name
 was not far off then was i as a tree
 whose boughs did bend with fruit but in one night
 a storm or robbery call it what you will
 shook down my mellow hangings nay my leaves
 and left me bare to weather
guiderius uncertain favour
belarius my fault being nothingas i have told you oft
 but that two villains whose false oaths prevail'd
 before my perfect honour swore to cymbeline
 i was confederate with the romans so
 follow'd my banishment and this twenty years
 this rock and these demesnes have been my world
 where i have lived at honest freedom paid
 more pious debts to heaven than in all
 the foreend of my time but up to the mountains
 this is not hunters language he that strikes
 the venison first shall be the lord o the feast
 to him the other two shall minister
 and we will fear no poison which attends
 in place of greater state i'll meet you in the valleys
 exeunt guiderius and arviragus
 how hard it is to hide the sparks of nature
 these boys know little they are sons to the king
 nor cymbeline dreams that they are alive
 they think they are mine and though train'd
 up thus meanly
 i the cave wherein they bow their thoughts do hit
 the roofs of palaces and nature prompts them
 in simple and low things to prince it much
 beyond the trick of others this polydore
 the heir of cymbeline and britain who
 the king his father call'd guideriusjove
 when on my threefoot stool i sit and tell
 the warlike feats i have done his spirits fly out
 into my story say thus mine enemy fell
 and thus i set my foot on s neck even then
 the princely blood flows in his cheek he sweats
 strains his young nerves and puts himself in posture
 that acts my words the younger brother cadwal
 once arviragus in as like a figure
 strikes life into my speech and shows much more
 his own conceivinghark the game is roused
 o cymbeline heaven and my conscience knows
 thou didst unjustly banish me whereon
 at three and two years old i stole these babes
 thinking to bar thee of succession as
 thou reft'st me of my lands euriphile
 thou wast their nurse they took thee for
 their mother
 and every day do honour to her grave
 myself belarius that am morgan call'd
 they take for natural father the game is up

act iii
scene iv country near milfordhaven
 enter pisanio and imogen
imogen thou told'st me when we came from horse the place
 was near at hand ne'er long'd my mother so
 to see me first as i have now pisanio man
 where is posthumus what is in thy mind
 that makes thee stare thus wherefore breaks that sigh
 from the inward of thee one but painted thus
 would be interpreted a thing perplex'd
 beyond selfexplication put thyself
 into a havior of less fear ere wildness
 vanquish my staider senses what's the matter
 why tender'st thou that paper to me with
 a look untender if't be summer news
 smile to't before if winterly thou need'st
 but keep that countenance still my husband's hand
 that drugdamn'd italy hath outcraftied him
 and he's at some hard point speak man thy tongue
 may take off some extremity which to read
 would be even mortal to me
pisanio please you read
 and you shall find me wretched man a thing
 the most disdain'd of fortune
imogen reads thy mistress pisanio hath played the
 strumpet in my bed the testimonies whereof lie
 bleeding in me i speak not out of weak surmises
 but from proof as strong as my grief and as certain
 as i expect my revenge that part thou pisanio
 must act for me if thy faith be not tainted with
 the breach of hers let thine own hands take away
 her life i shall give thee opportunity at
 milfordhaven she hath my letter for the purpose
 where if thou fear to strike and to make me certain
 it is done thou art the pandar to her dishonour and
 equally to me disloyal'
pisanio what shall i need to draw my sword the paper
 hath cut her throat already no tis slander
 whose edge is sharper than the sword whose tongue
 outvenoms all the worms of nile whose breath
 rides on the posting winds and doth belie
 all corners of the world kings queens and states
 maids matrons nay the secrets of the grave
 this viperous slander enters what cheer madam
imogen false to his bed what is it to be false
 to lie in watch there and to think on him
 to weep twixt clock and clock if sleep
 charge nature
 to break it with a fearful dream of him
 and cry myself awake that's false to's bed is it
pisanio alas good lady
imogen i false thy conscience witness iachimo
 thou didst accuse him of incontinency
 thou then look'dst like a villain now methinks
 thy favour's good enough some jay of italy
 whose mother was her painting hath betray'd him
