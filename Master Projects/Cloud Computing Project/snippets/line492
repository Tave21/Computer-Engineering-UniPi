flute no he hath simply the best wit of any handicraft
 man in athens
quince yea and the best person too and he is a very
 paramour for a sweet voice
flute you must say paragon a paramour is god bless us
 a thing of naught
 enter snug
snug masters the duke is coming from the temple and
 there is two or three lords and ladies more married
 if our sport had gone forward we had all been made
 men

 day during his life he could not have scaped

 sixpence a day for playing pyramus i'll be hanged
 he would have deserved it sixpence a day in
 pyramus or nothing
 enter bottom
bottom where are these lads where are these hearts
quince bottom o most courageous day o most happy hour
bottom masters i am to discourse wonders but ask me not

 lion's claws and most dear actors eat no onions
 nor garlic for we are to utter sweet breath and i
 do not doubt but to hear them say it is a sweet
 comedy no more words away go away
 exeunt
 a midsummer night's dream
act v
scene i athens the palace of theseus
 enter theseus hippolyta philostrate lords and
 attendants
hippolyta tis strange my theseus that these
 lovers speak of
theseus more strange than true i never may believe
 these antique fables nor these fairy toys
 lovers and madmen have such seething brains
 such shaping fantasies that apprehend
 more than cool reason ever comprehends
 the lunatic the lover and the poet
 are of imagination all compact
 one sees more devils than vast hell can hold
 that is the madman the lover all as frantic
 sees helen's beauty in a brow of egypt
 the poet's eye in fine frenzy rolling
 doth glance from heaven to earth from earth to heaven
 and as imagination bodies forth
 the forms of things unknown the poet's pen
 turns them to shapes and gives to airy nothing
 a local habitation and a name
 such tricks hath strong imagination
 that if it would but apprehend some joy
 it comprehends some bringer of that joy
 or in the night imagining some fear
 how easy is a bush supposed a bear
hippolyta but all the story of the night told over
 and all their minds transfigured so together
 more witnesseth than fancy's images
 and grows to something of great constancy
 but howsoever strange and admirable
theseus here come the lovers full of joy and mirth
 enter lysander demetrius hermia and helena
 joy gentle friends joy and fresh days of love
 accompany your hearts
lysander more than to us
 wait in your royal walks your board your bed
theseus come now what masques what dances shall we have
 to wear away this long age of three hours
 between our aftersupper and bedtime
 where is our usual manager of mirth
 what revels are in hand is there no play
 to ease the anguish of a torturing hour
 call philostrate
philostrate here mighty theseus
theseus say what abridgement have you for this evening
 what masque what music how shall we beguile
 the lazy time if not with some delight
philostrate there is a brief how many sports are ripe
 make choice of which your highness will see first
 giving a paper
theseus reads the battle with the centaurs to be sung
 by an athenian eunuch to the harp'
 we'll none of that that have i told my love
 in glory of my kinsman hercules
 reads
 the riot of the tipsy bacchanals
 tearing the thracian singer in their rage'
 that is an old device and it was play'd
 when i from thebes came last a conqueror
 reads
 the thrice three muses mourning for the death
 of learning late deceased in beggary'
 that is some satire keen and critical
 not sorting with a nuptial ceremony
 reads
 a tedious brief scene of young pyramus
 and his love thisbe very tragical mirth'
 merry and tragical tedious and brief
 that is hot ice and wondrous strange snow
 how shall we find the concord of this discord
philostrate a play there is my lord some ten words long
 which is as brief as i have known a play
 but by ten words my lord it is too long
 which makes it tedious for in all the play
 there is not one word apt one player fitted
 and tragical my noble lord it is
 for pyramus therein doth kill himself
 which when i saw rehearsed i must confess
 made mine eyes water but more merry tears
 the passion of loud laughter never shed
theseus what are they that do play it
philostrate hardhanded men that work in athens here
 which never labour'd in their minds till now
 and now have toil'd their unbreathed memories
 with this same play against your nuptial
theseus and we will hear it
philostrate no my noble lord
 it is not for you i have heard it over
 and it is nothing nothing in the world
 unless you can find sport in their intents
 extremely stretch'd and conn'd with cruel pain
 to do you service
theseus i will hear that play
 for never anything can be amiss
 when simpleness and duty tender it
 go bring them in and take your places ladies
 exit philostrate
hippolyta i love not to see wretchedness o'er charged
 and duty in his service perishing
theseus why gentle sweet you shall see no such thing
hippolyta he says they can do nothing in this kind
theseus the kinder we to give them thanks for nothing
 our sport shall be to take what they mistake
 and what poor duty cannot do noble respect
 takes it in might not merit
 where i have come great clerks have purposed
 to greet me with premeditated welcomes
 where i have seen them shiver and look pale
 make periods in the midst of sentences
 throttle their practised accent in their fears
 and in conclusion dumbly have broke off
 not paying me a welcome trust me sweet
 out of this silence yet i pick'd a welcome
 and in the modesty of fearful duty
 i read as much as from the rattling tongue
 of saucy and audacious eloquence
 love therefore and tonguetied simplicity
 in least speak most to my capacity
 reenter philostrate
philostrate so please your grace the prologue is address'd
theseus let him approach
 flourish of trumpets
 enter quince for the prologue
prologue if we offend it is with our good will
 that you should think we come not to offend
 but with good will to show our simple skill
 that is the true beginning of our end
 consider then we come but in despite
 we do not come as minding to contest you
 our true intent is all for your delight
 we are not here that you should here repent you
 the actors are at hand and by their show
 you shall know all that you are like to know
theseus this fellow doth not stand upon points
lysander he hath rid his prologue like a rough colt he knows
 not the stop a good moral my lord it is not
 enough to speak but to speak true
hippolyta indeed he hath played on his prologue like a child
 on a recorder a sound but not in government
theseus his speech was like a tangled chain nothing
 impaired but all disordered who is next
 enter pyramus and thisbe wall moonshine and lion
prologue gentles perchance you wonder at this show
 but wonder on till truth make all things plain
 this man is pyramus if you would know
 this beauteous lady thisby is certain
 this man with lime and roughcast doth present
 wall that vile wall which did these lovers sunder
 and through wall's chink poor souls they are content
 to whisper at the which let no man wonder
 this man with lanthorn dog and bush of thorn
 presenteth moonshine for if you will know
 by moonshine did these lovers think no scorn
 to meet at ninus tomb there there to woo
 this grisly beast which lion hight by name
 the trusty thisby coming first by night
 did scare away or rather did affright
 and as she fled her mantle she did fall
 which lion vile with bloody mouth did stain
 anon comes pyramus sweet youth and tall
