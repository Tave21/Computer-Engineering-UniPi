fabian very brief and to exceeding good senseless
sir toby belch reads i will waylay thee going home where if it
 be thy chance to kill me'
fabian good
sir toby belch reads thou killest me like a rogue and a villain'
fabian still you keep o the windy side of the law good
sir toby belch reads fare thee well and god have mercy upon
 one of our souls he may have mercy upon mine but
 my hope is better and so look to thyself thy
 friend as thou usest him and thy sworn enemy
 andrew aguecheek
 if this letter move him not his legs cannot
 i'll give't him
maria you may have very fit occasion for't he is now in
 some commerce with my lady and will by and by depart
sir toby belch go sir andrew scout me for him at the corner the
 orchard like a bumbaily so soon as ever thou seest
 him draw and as thou drawest swear horrible for
 it comes to pass oft that a terrible oath with a
 swaggering accent sharply twanged off gives manhood
 more approbation than ever proof itself would have
 earned him away
sir andrew nay let me alone for swearing
 exit
sir toby belch now will not i deliver his letter for the behavior
 of the young gentleman gives him out to be of good
 capacity and breeding his employment between his
 lord and my niece confirms no less therefore this
 letter being so excellently ignorant will breed no
 terror in the youth he will find it comes from a
 clodpole but sir i will deliver his challenge by
 word of mouth set upon aguecheek a notable report
 of valour and drive the gentleman as i know his
 youth will aptly receive it into a most hideous
 opinion of his rage skill fury and impetuosity
 this will so fright them both that they will kill
 one another by the look like cockatrices
 reenter olivia with viola
fabian here he comes with your niece give them way till
 he take leave and presently after him
sir toby belch i will meditate the while upon some horrid message
 for a challenge
 exeunt sir toby belch fabian and maria
olivia i have said too much unto a heart of stone
 and laid mine honour too unchary out
 there's something in me that reproves my fault
 but such a headstrong potent fault it is
 that it but mocks reproof
viola with the same havior that your passion bears
 goes on my master's grief
olivia here wear this jewel for me tis my picture
 refuse it not it hath no tongue to vex you
 and i beseech you come again tomorrow

 carpet consideration but he is a devil in private
 brawl souls and bodies hath he divorced three and
 his incensement at this moment is so implacable
 that satisfaction can be none but by pangs of death
 and sepulchre hob nob is his word give't or take't
viola i will return again into the house and desire some
 conduct of the lady i am no fighter i have heard
 of some kind of men that put quarrels purposely on
 others to taste their valour belike this is a man
 of that quirk
sir toby belch sir no his indignation derives itself out of a
 very competent injury therefore get you on and
 give him his desire back you shall not to the
 house unless you undertake that with me which with
 as much safety you might answer him therefore on
 or strip your sword stark naked for meddle you
 must that's certain or forswear to wear iron about you

 this courteous office as to know of the knight what
 my offence to him is it is something of my
 negligence nothing of my purpose

 gentleman till my return

 mortal arbitrement but nothing of the circumstance more
viola i beseech you what manner of man is he
fabian nothing of that wonderful promise to read him by
 his form as you are like to find him in the proof
 of his valour he is indeed sir the most skilful
 bloody and fatal opposite that you could possibly
 have found in any part of illyria will you walk
 towards him i will make your peace with him if i
 can
viola i shall be much bound to you for't i am one that
 had rather go with sir priest than sir knight i
 care not who knows so much of my mettle
