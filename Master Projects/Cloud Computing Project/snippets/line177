 than is the coal of fire upon the ice
 or hailstone in the sun your virtue is
 to make him worthy whose offence subdues him
 and curse that justice did it
 who deserves greatness
 deserves your hate and your affections are
 a sick man's appetite who desires most that
 which would increase his evil he that depends
 upon your favours swims with fins of lead
 and hews down oaks with rushes hang ye trust ye
 with every minute you do change a mind
 and call him noble that was now your hate
 him vile that was your garland what's the matter
 that in these several places of the city
 you cry against the noble senate who
 under the gods keep you in awe which else
 would feed on one another what's their seeking
menenius for corn at their own rates whereof they say
 the city is well stored
marcius hang em they say
 they'll sit by the fire and presume to know
 what's done i the capitol who's like to rise
 who thrives and who declines side factions
 and give out
 conjectural marriages making parties strong
 and feebling such as stand not in their liking
 below their cobbled shoes they say there's
 grain enough
 would the nobility lay aside their ruth
 and let me use my sword i'll make a quarry
 with thousands of these quarter'd slaves as high
 as i could pick my lance
menenius nay these are almost thoroughly persuaded
 for though abundantly they lack discretion
 yet are they passing cowardly but i beseech you
 what says the other troop
marcius they are dissolved hang em
 they said they were anhungry sigh'd forth proverbs
 that hunger broke stone walls that dogs must eat
 that meat was made for mouths that the gods sent not
 corn for the rich men only with these shreds
 they vented their complainings which being answer'd
 and a petition granted them a strange one
 to break the heart of generosity
 and make bold power look palethey threw their caps
 as they would hang them on the horns o the moon
 shouting their emulation
menenius what is granted them
marcius five tribunes to defend their vulgar wisdoms
 of their own choice one's junius brutus
 sicinius velutus and i know not'sdeath
 the rabble should have first unroof'd the city
 ere so prevail'd with me it will in time
 win upon power and throw forth greater themes
 for insurrection's arguing
menenius this is strange
marcius go get you home you fragments
 enter a messenger hastily
messenger where's caius marcius
marcius here what's the matter
messenger the news is sir the volsces are in arms
marcius i am glad on t then we shall ha means to vent
 our musty superfluity see our best elders
 enter cominius titus lartius and other senators
 junius brutus and sicinius velutus
first senator marcius tis true that you have lately told us
 the volsces are in arms
marcius they have a leader
 tullus aufidius that will put you to t
 i sin in envying his nobility
 and were i any thing but what i am
 i would wish me only he
cominius you have fought together
marcius were half to half the world by the ears and he
 upon my party i'ld revolt to make
 only my wars with him he is a lion
 that i am proud to hunt
first senator then worthy marcius
 attend upon cominius to these wars
cominius it is your former promise
marcius sir it is
 and i am constant titus lartius thou
 shalt see me once more strike at tullus face
 what art thou stiff stand'st out
titus no caius marcius
 i'll lean upon one crutch and fight with t'other
 ere stay behind this business
menenius o truebred
first senator your company to the capitol where i know
 our greatest friends attend us
titus to cominius lead you on
 to marcius follow cominius we must follow you
 right worthy you priority
cominius noble marcius
first senator to the citizens hence to your homes be gone
marcius nay let them follow
 the volsces have much corn take these rats thither
 to gnaw their garners worshipful mutiners
 your valour puts well forth pray follow
 citizens steal away exeunt all but sicinius
 and brutus
sicinius was ever man so proud as is this marcius
brutus he has no equal
sicinius when we were chosen tribunes for the people
brutus mark'd you his lip and eyes
sicinius nay but his taunts
brutus being moved he will not spare to gird the gods
sicinius bemock the modest moon
brutus the present wars devour him he is grown
 too proud to be so valiant
sicinius such a nature
 tickled with good success disdains the shadow
 which he treads on at noon but i do wonder
 his insolence can brook to be commanded
 under cominius
brutus fame at the which he aims
 in whom already he's well graced can not
 better be held nor more attain'd than by
 a place below the first for what miscarries
 shall be the general's fault though he perform
 to the utmost of a man and giddy censure
 will then cry out of marcius o if he
 had borne the business'
sicinius besides if things go well
 opinion that so sticks on marcius shall
 of his demerits rob cominius
brutus come
 half all cominius honours are to marcius
 though marcius earned them not and all his faults
 to marcius shall be honours though indeed
 in aught he merit not
sicinius let's hence and hear
 how the dispatch is made and in what fashion
 more than his singularity he goes
 upon this present action

 enter tullus aufidius and certain senators
first senator so your opinion is aufidius
 that they of rome are entered in our counsels
 and know how we proceed
aufidius is it not yours
 what ever have been thought on in this state
 that could be brought to bodily act ere rome
 had circumvention tis not four days gone
 since i heard thence these are the words i think
 i have the letter here yes here it is
 reads
 they have press'd a power but it is not known
 whether for east or west the dearth is great
 the people mutinous and it is rumour'd
 cominius marcius your old enemy
 who is of rome worse hated than of you
 and titus lartius a most valiant roman
 these three lead on this preparation
 whither tis bent most likely tis for you
 consider of it'
first senator our army's in the field
 we never yet made doubt but rome was ready
 to answer us
aufidius nor did you think it folly
 to keep your great pretences veil'd till when
 they needs must show themselves which
 in the hatching
 it seem'd appear'd to rome by the discovery
 we shall be shorten'd in our aim which was
 to take in many towns ere almost rome
 should know we were afoot
second senator noble aufidius
 take your commission hie you to your bands
 let us alone to guard corioli
 if they set down before s for the remove
 bring your army but i think you'll find
 they've not prepared for us
aufidius o doubt not that
 i speak from certainties nay more
 some parcels of their power are forth already
 and only hitherward i leave your honours
 if we and caius marcius chance to meet
 tis sworn between us we shall ever strike
 till one can do no more
all the gods assist you
aufidius and keep your honours safe
first senator farewell
second senator farewell
all farewell
