 to the warm sun
 approach thou beacon to this under globe
 that by thy comfortable beams i may
 peruse this letter nothing almost sees miracles
 but misery i know tis from cordelia
 who hath most fortunately been inform'd
 of my obscured course and shall find time
 from this enormous state seeking to give
 losses their remedies all weary and o'erwatch'd
 take vantage heavy eyes not to behold
 this shameful lodging
 fortune good night smile once more turn thy wheel
 sleeps

act ii
scene iii a wood
 enter edgar
edgar i heard myself proclaim'd
 and by the happy hollow of a tree
 escaped the hunt no port is free no place
 that guard and most unusual vigilance
 does not attend my taking whiles i may scape
 i will preserve myself and am bethought
 to take the basest and most poorest shape
 that ever penury in contempt of man
 brought near to beast my face i'll grime with filth
 blanket my loins elf all my hair in knots
 and with presented nakedness outface
 the winds and persecutions of the sky
 the country gives me proof and precedent
 of bedlam beggars who with roaring voices
 strike in their numb'd and mortified bare arms
 pins wooden pricks nails sprigs of rosemary
 and with this horrible object from low farms
 poor pelting villages sheepcotes and mills
 sometime with lunatic bans sometime with prayers
 enforce their charity poor turlygod poor tom
 that's something yet edgar i nothing am

act ii
scene iv before gloucester's castle kent in the stocks
 enter king lear fool and gentleman
king lear tis strange that they should so depart from home
 and not send back my messenger
gentleman as i learn'd
 the night before there was no purpose in them
 of this remove
kent hail to thee noble master
king lear ha
 makest thou this shame thy pastime
kent no my lord
fool ha ha he wears cruel garters horses are tied
 by the heads dogs and bears by the neck monkeys by
 the loins and men by the legs when a man's
 overlusty at legs then he wears wooden
 netherstocks
king lear what's he that hath so much thy place mistook
 to set thee here
kent it is both he and she
 your son and daughter
king lear no
kent yes
king lear no i say
kent i say yea
king lear no no they would not
kent yes they have
king lear by jupiter i swear no
kent by juno i swear ay
king lear they durst not do t
 they could not would not do t tis worse than murder
 to do upon respect such violent outrage
 resolve me with all modest haste which way
 thou mightst deserve or they impose this usage
 coming from us
kent my lord when at their home
 i did commend your highness letters to them
 ere i was risen from the place that show'd
 my duty kneeling came there a reeking post
 stew'd in his haste half breathless panting forth
 from goneril his mistress salutations
 deliver'd letters spite of intermission
 which presently they read on whose contents
 they summon'd up their meiny straight took horse
 commanded me to follow and attend
 the leisure of their answer gave me cold looks
 and meeting here the other messenger
 whose welcome i perceived had poison'd mine
 being the very fellow that of late
 display'd so saucily against your highness
 having more man than wit about me drew
 he raised the house with loud and coward cries
 your son and daughter found this trespass worth
 the shame which here it suffers
fool winter's not gone yet if the wildgeese fly that way
 fathers that wear rags
 do make their children blind
 but fathers that bear bags
 shall see their children kind
 fortune that arrant whore
 ne'er turns the key to the poor
 but for all this thou shalt have as many dolours
 for thy daughters as thou canst tell in a year
king lear o how this mother swells up toward my heart
 hysterica passio down thou climbing sorrow
 thy element's below where is this daughter
kent with the earl sir here within
king lear follow me not
 stay here
 exit
gentleman made you no more offence but what you speak of
kent none
 how chance the king comes with so small a train
fool and thou hadst been set i the stocks for that
 question thou hadst well deserved it
kent why fool
fool we'll set thee to school to an ant to teach thee
 there's no labouring i the winter all that follow
 their noses are led by their eyes but blind men and
 there's not a nose among twenty but can smell him
 that's stinking let go thy hold when a great wheel
 runs down a hill lest it break thy neck with
 following it but the great one that goes up the
 hill let him draw thee after when a wise man
 gives thee better counsel give me mine again i
 would have none but knaves follow it since a fool gives it
 that sir which serves and seeks for gain
 and follows but for form
 will pack when it begins to rain
 and leave thee in the storm
 but i will tarry the fool will stay
 and let the wise man fly
 the knave turns fool that runs away
 the fool no knave perdy
kent where learned you this fool
fool not i the stocks fool
 reenter king lear with gloucester
king lear deny to speak with me they are sick they are weary
 they have travell'd all the night mere fetches
 the images of revolt and flying off
 fetch me a better answer
gloucester my dear lord
 you know the fiery quality of the duke
 how unremoveable and fix'd he is
 in his own course

 would with his daughter speak commands her service
 are they inform'd of this my breath and blood
 fiery the fiery duke tell the hot duke that
 no but not yet may be he is not well
 infirmity doth still neglect all office
 whereto our health is bound we are not ourselves
 when nature being oppress'd commands the mind
 to suffer with the body i'll forbear
 and am fall'n out with my more headier will
 to take the indisposed and sickly fit
 for the sound man death on my state wherefore
 looking on kent
 should he sit here this act persuades me
 that this remotion of the duke and her
 is practise only give me my servant forth
 go tell the duke and s wife i'ld speak with them
 now presently bid them come forth and hear me
 or at their chamberdoor i'll beat the drum
 till it cry sleep to death
gloucester i would have all well betwixt you
 exit
king lear o me my heart my rising heart but down
fool cry to it nuncle as the cockney did to the eels
 when she put em i the paste alive she knapped em
 o the coxcombs with a stick and cried down
 wantons down twas her brother that in pure
 kindness to his horse buttered his hay
 enter cornwall regan gloucester and servants
king lear good morrow to you both
cornwall hail to your grace
 kent is set at liberty
regan i am glad to see your highness
king lear regan i think you are i know what reason
 i have to think so if thou shouldst not be glad
 i would divorce me from thy mother's tomb
 sepulchring an adultress
 to kent
 o are you free
 some other time for that beloved regan
 thy sister's naught o regan she hath tied
 sharptooth'd unkindness like a vulture here
 points to his heart
 i can scarce speak to thee thou'lt not believe
 with how depraved a qualityo regan

 than she to scant her duty
