 thou shalt be placed as viceroy under him
 and still enjoy thy regal dignity
alencon must he be then as shadow of himself
 adorn his temples with a coronet
 and yet in substance and authority
 retain but privilege of a private man
 this proffer is absurd and reasonless
charles tis known already that i am possess'd
 with more than half the gallian territories
 and therein reverenced for their lawful king
 shall i for lucre of the rest unvanquish'd
 detract so much from that prerogative
 as to be call'd but viceroy of the whole
 no lord ambassador i'll rather keep
 that which i have than coveting for more
 be cast from possibility of all
york insulting charles hast thou by secret means
 used intercession to obtain a league
 and now the matter grows to compromise
 stand'st thou aloof upon comparison
 either accept the title thou usurp'st
 of benefit proceeding from our king
 and not of any challenge of desert
 or we will plague thee with incessant wars
reignier my lord you do not well in obstinacy
 to cavil in the course of this contract
 if once it be neglected ten to one
 we shall not find like opportunity
alencon to say the truth it is your policy
 to save your subjects from such massacre
 and ruthless slaughters as are daily seen
 by our proceeding in hostility
 and therefore take this compact of a truce
 although you break it when your pleasure serves
warwick how say'st thou charles shall our condition stand
charles it shall
 only reserved you claim no interest
 in any of our towns of garrison
york then swear allegiance to his majesty
 as thou art knight never to disobey
 nor be rebellious to the crown of england
 thou nor thy nobles to the crown of england
 so now dismiss your army when ye please
 hang up your ensign let your drums be still
 for here we entertain a solemn peace

 1 king henry vi
act v
scene v london the palace
 enter suffolk in conference with king henry vi
 gloucester and exeter
king henry vi your wondrous rare description noble earl
 of beauteous margaret hath astonish'd me
 her virtues graced with external gifts
 do breed love's settled passions in my heart
 and like as rigor of tempestuous gusts
 provokes the mightiest hulk against the tide
 so am i driven by breath of her renown
 either to suffer shipwreck or arrive
 where i may have fruition of her love
suffolk tush my good lord this superficial tale
 is but a preface of her worthy praise
 the chief perfections of that lovely dame
 had i sufficient skill to utter them
 would make a volume of enticing lines
 able to ravish any dull conceit
 and which is more she is not so divine
 so fullreplete with choice of all delights
 but with as humble lowliness of mind
 she is content to be at your command
 command i mean of virtuous chaste intents
 to love and honour henry as her lord
king henry vi and otherwise will henry ne'er presume
 therefore my lord protector give consent
 that margaret may be england's royal queen
gloucester so should i give consent to flatter sin
 you know my lord your highness is betroth'd
 unto another lady of esteem
 how shall we then dispense with that contract
 and not deface your honour with reproach
suffolk as doth a ruler with unlawful oaths
 or one that at a triumph having vow'd
 to try his strength forsaketh yet the lists
 by reason of his adversary's odds
 a poor earl's daughter is unequal odds
 and therefore may be broke without offence
gloucester why what i pray is margaret more than that
 her father is no better than an earl
 although in glorious titles he excel
suffolk yes lord her father is a king
 the king of naples and jerusalem
 and of such great authority in france
 as his alliance will confirm our peace
 and keep the frenchmen in allegiance
gloucester and so the earl of armagnac may do
 because he is near kinsman unto charles
exeter beside his wealth doth warrant a liberal dower
 where reignier sooner will receive than give
suffolk a dower my lords disgrace not so your king
 that he should be so abject base and poor
 to choose for wealth and not for perfect love
 henry is able to enrich his queen
 and not seek a queen to make him rich
 so worthless peasants bargain for their wives
 as marketmen for oxen sheep or horse
 marriage is a matter of more worth
 than to be dealt in by attorneyship
 not whom we will but whom his grace affects
 must be companion of his nuptial bed
 and therefore lords since he affects her most
 it most of all these reasons bindeth us
 in our opinions she should be preferr'd
 for what is wedlock forced but a hell
 an age of discord and continual strife
 whereas the contrary bringeth bliss
 and is a pattern of celestial peace
 whom should we match with henry being a king
 but margaret that is daughter to a king
 her peerless feature joined with her birth
 approves her fit for none but for a king
 her valiant courage and undaunted spirit
 more than in women commonly is seen
 will answer our hope in issue of a king
 for henry son unto a conqueror
 is likely to beget more conquerors
 if with a lady of so high resolve
 as is fair margaret he be link'd in love
 then yield my lords and here conclude with me
 that margaret shall be queen and none but she
king henry vi whether it be through force of your report
 my noble lord of suffolk or for that
 my tender youth was never yet attaint
 with any passion of inflaming love
 i cannot tell but this i am assured
 i feel such sharp dissension in my breast
 such fierce alarums both of hope and fear
 as i am sick with working of my thoughts
 take therefore shipping post my lord to france
 agree to any covenants and procure
 that lady margaret do vouchsafe to come
 to cross the seas to england and be crown'd
 king henry's faithful and anointed queen
 for your expenses and sufficient charge
 among the people gather up a tenth
 be gone i say for till you do return
 i rest perplexed with a thousand cares
 and you good uncle banish all offence
 if you do censure me by what you were
 not what you are i know it will excuse
 this sudden execution of my will
 and so conduct me where from company
 i may revolve and ruminate my grief
 exit
gloucester ay grief i fear me both at first and last
 exeunt gloucester and exeter
suffolk thus suffolk hath prevail'd and thus he goes
 as did the youthful paris once to greece
 with hope to find the like event in love
 but prosper better than the trojan did
 margaret shall now be queen and rule the king
 but i will rule both her the king and realm
