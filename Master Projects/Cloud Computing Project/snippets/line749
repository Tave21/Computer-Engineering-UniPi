 king richard ii
act ii
scene i ely house
 enter john of gaunt sick with the duke of york
 &c
john of gaunt will the king come that i may breathe my last
 in wholesome counsel to his unstaid youth
duke of york vex not yourself nor strive not with your breath
 for all in vain comes counsel to his ear
john of gaunt o but they say the tongues of dying men
 enforce attention like deep harmony
 where words are scarce they are seldom spent in vain
 for they breathe truth that breathe their words in pain
 he that no more must say is listen'd more
 than they whom youth and ease have taught to glose
 more are men's ends mark'd than their lives before
 the setting sun and music at the close
 as the last taste of sweets is sweetest last
 writ in remembrance more than things long past
 though richard my life's counsel would not hear
 my death's sad tale may yet undeaf his ear
duke of york no it is stopp'd with other flattering sounds
 as praises of whose taste the wise are fond
 lascivious metres to whose venom sound
 the open ear of youth doth always listen
 report of fashions in proud italy
 whose manners still our tardy apish nation
 limps after in base imitation
 where doth the world thrust forth a vanity
 so it be new there's no respect how vile
 that is not quickly buzzed into his ears
 then all too late comes counsel to be heard
 where will doth mutiny with wit's regard
 direct not him whose way himself will choose
 tis breath thou lack'st and that breath wilt thou lose
john of gaunt methinks i am a prophet new inspired
 and thus expiring do foretell of him
 his rash fierce blaze of riot cannot last
 for violent fires soon burn out themselves
 small showers last long but sudden storms are short
 he tires betimes that spurs too fast betimes
 with eager feeding food doth choke the feeder
 light vanity insatiate cormorant
 consuming means soon preys upon itself
 this royal throne of kings this scepter'd isle
 this earth of majesty this seat of mars
 this other eden demiparadise
 this fortress built by nature for herself
 against infection and the hand of war
 this happy breed of men this little world
 this precious stone set in the silver sea
 which serves it in the office of a wall
 or as a moat defensive to a house
 against the envy of less happier lands
 this blessed plot this earth this realm this england
 this nurse this teeming womb of royal kings
 fear'd by their breed and famous by their birth
 renowned for their deeds as far from home
 for christian service and true chivalry
 as is the sepulchre in stubborn jewry
 of the world's ransom blessed mary's son
 this land of such dear souls this dear dear land
 dear for her reputation through the world
 is now leased out i die pronouncing it
 like to a tenement or pelting farm
 england bound in with the triumphant sea
 whose rocky shore beats back the envious siege
 of watery neptune is now bound in with shame
 with inky blots and rotten parchment bonds
 that england that was wont to conquer others
 hath made a shameful conquest of itself
 ah would the scandal vanish with my life
 how happy then were my ensuing death
 enter king richard ii and queen duke of aumerle
 bushy green bagot lord ross and lord
 willoughby
duke of york the king is come deal mildly with his youth
 for young hot colts being raged do rage the more
queen how fares our noble uncle lancaster
king richard ii what comfort man how is't with aged gaunt
john of gaunt o how that name befits my composition
 old gaunt indeed and gaunt in being old
 within me grief hath kept a tedious fast
 and who abstains from meat that is not gaunt
 for sleeping england long time have i watch'd
 watching breeds leanness leanness is all gaunt
 the pleasure that some fathers feed upon
 is my strict fast i mean my children's looks
 and therein fasting hast thou made me gaunt
 gaunt am i for the grave gaunt as a grave
 whose hollow womb inherits nought but bones
king richard ii can sick men play so nicely with their names
john of gaunt no misery makes sport to mock itself
 since thou dost seek to kill my name in me
 i mock my name great king to flatter thee
king richard ii should dying men flatter with those that live
john of gaunt no no men living flatter those that die
king richard ii thou now adying say'st thou flatterest me
john of gaunt o no thou diest though i the sicker be
king richard ii i am in health i breathe and see thee ill
john of gaunt now he that made me knows i see thee ill
 ill in myself to see and in thee seeing ill
 thy deathbed is no lesser than thy land
 wherein thou liest in reputation sick
 and thou too careless patient as thou art
 commit'st thy anointed body to the cure
 of those physicians that first wounded thee
 a thousand flatterers sit within thy crown
 whose compass is no bigger than thy head
 and yet incaged in so small a verge
 the waste is no whit lesser than thy land
 o had thy grandsire with a prophet's eye
 seen how his son's son should destroy his sons
 from forth thy reach he would have laid thy shame
 deposing thee before thou wert possess'd
 which art possess'd now to depose thyself
 why cousin wert thou regent of the world
 it were a shame to let this land by lease
 but for thy world enjoying but this land
 is it not more than shame to shame it so
 landlord of england art thou now not king
 thy state of law is bondslave to the law and thou
king richard ii a lunatic leanwitted fool
 presuming on an ague's privilege
 darest with thy frozen admonition
 make pale our cheek chasing the royal blood
 with fury from his native residence
 now by my seat's right royal majesty
 wert thou not brother to great edward's son
 this tongue that runs so roundly in thy head
 should run thy head from thy unreverent shoulders
john of gaunt o spare me not my brother edward's son
 for that i was his father edward's son
 that blood already like the pelican
 hast thou tapp'd out and drunkenly caroused
 my brother gloucester plain wellmeaning soul
 whom fair befal in heaven mongst happy souls
 may be a precedent and witness good
 that thou respect'st not spilling edward's blood
 join with the present sickness that i have
 and thy unkindness be like crooked age
 to crop at once a too long wither'd flower
 live in thy shame but die not shame with thee
 these words hereafter thy tormentors be
 convey me to my bed then to my grave
 love they to live that love and honour have
 exit borne off by his attendants
king richard ii and let them die that age and sullens have
 for both hast thou and both become the grave
duke of york i do beseech your majesty impute his words
 to wayward sickliness and age in him
 he loves you on my life and holds you dear
 as harry duke of hereford were he here
king richard ii right you say true as hereford's love so his
 as theirs so mine and all be as it is
 enter northumberland
northumberland my liege old gaunt commends him to your majesty
king richard ii what says he
northumberland nay nothing all is said
 his tongue is now a stringless instrument
 words life and all old lancaster hath spent
duke of york be york the next that must be bankrupt so
 though death be poor it ends a mortal woe
king richard ii the ripest fruit first falls and so doth he
 his time is spent our pilgrimage must be
 so much for that now for our irish wars
 we must supplant those rough rugheaded kerns
 which live like venom where no venom else
 but only they have privilege to live
 and for these great affairs do ask some charge
 towards our assistance we do seize to us
 the plate corn revenues and moveables
 whereof our uncle gaunt did stand possess'd
duke of york how long shall i be patient ah how long
 shall tender duty make me suffer wrong
 not gloucester's death nor hereford's banishment
 not gaunt's rebukes nor england's private wrongs
 nor the prevention of poor bolingbroke
 about his marriage nor my own disgrace
 have ever made me sour my patient cheek
 or bend one wrinkle on my sovereign's face
 i am the last of noble edward's sons
 of whom thy father prince of wales was first
 in war was never lion raged more fierce
 in peace was never gentle lamb more mild
 than was that young and princely gentleman
