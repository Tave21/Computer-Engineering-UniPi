 or by our greatness and the grace of it
 which is our honour bitter torture shall
 winnow the truth from falsehood on speak to him
imogen my boon is that this gentleman may render
 of whom he had this ring
posthumus leonatus aside what's that to him
cymbeline that diamond upon your finger say
 how came it yours
iachimo thou'lt torture me to leave unspoken that
 which to be spoke would torture thee
cymbeline how me
iachimo i am glad to be constrain'd to utter that
 which torments me to conceal by villany

 whom thou didst banish andwhich more may
 grieve thee

 i had rather thou shouldst live while nature will
 than die ere i hear more strive man and speak
iachimo upon a timeunhappy was the clock
 that struck the hourit was in romeaccursed
 the mansion where'twas at a feasto would
 our viands had been poison'd or at least
 those which i heaved to headthe good posthumus
 what should i say he was too good to be
 where ill men were and was the best of all
 amongst the rarest of good onessitting sadly
 hearing us praise our loves of italy
 for beauty that made barren the swell'd boast
 of him that best could speak for feature laming
 the shrine of venus or straightpight minerva
 postures beyond brief nature for condition
 a shop of all the qualities that man
 loves woman for besides that hook of wiving
 fairness which strikes the eye
cymbeline i stand on fire
 come to the matter
iachimo all too soon i shall
 unless thou wouldst grieve quickly this posthumus
 most like a noble lord in love and one
 that had a royal lover took his hint
 and not dispraising whom we praisedtherein
 he was as calm as virtuehe began
 his mistress picture which by his tongue
 being made
 and then a mind put in't either our brags
 were crack'd of kitchentrolls or his description
 proved us unspeaking sots
cymbeline nay nay to the purpose
iachimo your daughter's chastitythere it begins
 he spake of her as dian had hot dreams
 and she alone were cold whereat i wretch
 made scruple of his praise and wager'd with him
 pieces of gold gainst this which then he wore
 upon his honour'd finger to attain
 in suit the place of's bed and win this ring
 by hers and mine adultery he true knight
 no lesser of her honour confident
 than i did truly find her stakes this ring
 and would so had it been a carbuncle
 of phoebus wheel and might so safely had it
 been all the worth of's car away to britain
 post i in this design well may you sir
 remember me at court where i was taught
 of your chaste daughter the wide difference
 twixt amorous and villanous being thus quench'd
 of hope not longing mine italian brain
 gan in your duller britain operate
 most vilely for my vantage excellent
 and to be brief my practise so prevail'd
 that i return'd with simular proof enough
 to make the noble leonatus mad
 by wounding his belief in her renown
 with tokens thus and thus averting notes
 of chamberhanging pictures this her bracelet
 o cunning how i got itnay some marks
 of secret on her person that he could not
 but think her bond of chastity quite crack'd
 i having ta'en the forfeit whereupon
 methinks i see him now
posthumus leonatus advancing ay so thou dost
 italian fiend ay me most credulous fool
 egregious murderer thief any thing
 that's due to all the villains past in being
 to come o give me cord or knife or poison
 some upright justicer thou king send out
 for torturers ingenious it is i
 that all the abhorred things o the earth amend
 by being worse than they i am posthumus
 that kill'd thy daughtervillainlike i lie
 that caused a lesser villain than myself
 a sacrilegious thief to do't the temple
 of virtue was she yea and she herself
 spit and throw stones cast mire upon me set
 the dogs o the street to bay me every villain
 be call'd posthumus leonitus and
 be villany less than twas o imogen
 my queen my life my wife o imogen

imogen peace my lord hear hear
posthumus leonatus shall's have a play of this thou scornful page
 there lie thy part
 striking her she falls
pisanio o gentlemen help
 mine and your mistress o my lord posthumus
 you ne'er kill'd imogen til now help help
 mine honour'd lady
cymbeline does the world go round
posthumus leonatus how come these staggers on me
pisanio wake my mistress
cymbeline if this be so the gods do mean to strike me
 to death with mortal joy
pisanio how fares thy mistress
imogen o get thee from my sight
 thou gavest me poison dangerous fellow hence
 breathe not where princes are
cymbeline the tune of imogen
pisanio lady
 the gods throw stones of sulphur on me if
 that box i gave you was not thought by me
 a precious thing i had it from the queen
cymbeline new matter still
imogen it poison'd me
cornelius o gods
 i left out one thing which the queen confess'd
 which must approve thee honest if pisanio
 have said she given his mistress that confection
 which i gave him for cordial she is served
 as i would serve a rat'
cymbeline what's this comelius
cornelius the queen sir very oft importuned me
 to temper poisons for her still pretending
 the satisfaction of her knowledge only
 in killing creatures vile as cats and dogs
 of no esteem i dreading that her purpose
 was of more danger did compound for her
 a certain stuff which being ta'en would cease
 the present power of life but in short time
 all offices of nature should again
 do their due functions have you ta'en of it
imogen most like i did for i was dead
belarius my boys
 there was our error
guiderius this is sure fidele
imogen why did you throw your wedded lady from you
 think that you are upon a rock and now
 throw me again
 embracing him
posthumus leonatus hang there like a fruit my soul
 till the tree die
cymbeline how now my flesh my child
 what makest thou me a dullard in this act
 wilt thou not speak to me
imogen kneeling your blessing sir
belarius to guiderius and arviragus though you did love
 this youth i blame ye not
 you had a motive for't
cymbeline my tears that fall
 prove holy water on thee imogen
 thy mother's dead
imogen i am sorry for't my lord
cymbeline o she was nought and long of her it was
 that we meet here so strangely but her son
 is gone we know not how nor where
pisanio my lord
 now fear is from me i'll speak troth lord cloten
 upon my lady's missing came to me
 with his sword drawn foam'd at the mouth and swore
 if i discover'd not which way she was gone
 it was my instant death by accident
 had a feigned letter of my master's
 then in my pocket which directed him
 to seek her on the mountains near to milford
 where in a frenzy in my master's garments
 which he enforced from me away he posts
 with unchaste purpose and with oath to violate
 my lady's honour what became of him
 i further know not
guiderius let me end the story
 i slew him there
cymbeline marry the gods forfend
 i would not thy good deeds should from my lips
 pluck a bard sentence prithee valiant youth
 deny't again
guiderius i have spoke it and i did it
cymbeline he was a prince
guiderius a most incivil one the wrongs he did me
 were nothing princelike for he did provoke me
 with language that would make me spurn the sea
 if it could so roar to me i cut off's head
 and am right glad he is not standing here
 to tell this tale of mine
cymbeline i am sorry for thee
 by thine own tongue thou art condemn'd and must
