first gaoler you shall not now be stol'n you have locks upon you
 so graze as you find pasture
second gaoler ay or a stomach
 exeunt gaolers
posthumus leonatus most welcome bondage for thou art away
 think to liberty yet am i better
 than one that's sick o the gout since he had rather
 groan so in perpetuity than be cured
 by the sure physician death who is the key
 to unbar these locks my conscience thou art fetter'd
 more than my shanks and wrists you good gods give me
 the penitent instrument to pick that bolt
 then free for ever is't enough i am sorry
 so children temporal fathers do appease
 gods are more full of mercy must i repent
 i cannot do it better than in gyves
 desired more than constrain'd to satisfy
 if of my freedom tis the main part take
 no stricter render of me than my all
 i know you are more clement than vile men
 who of their broken debtors take a third
 a sixth a tenth letting them thrive again
 on their abatement that's not my desire
 for imogen's dear life take mine and though
 tis not so dear yet tis a life you coin'd it
 tween man and man they weigh not every stamp
 though light take pieces for the figure's sake
 you rather mine being yours and so great powers
 if you will take this audit take this life
 and cancel these cold bonds o imogen
 i'll speak to thee in silence
 sleeps
 solemn music enter as in an apparition
 sicilius leonatus father to posthumus leonatus
 an old man attired like a warrior leading in
 his hand an ancient matron his wife and mother
 to posthumus leonatus with music before them
 then after other music follow the two young
 leonati brothers to posthumus leonatus with
 wounds as they died in the wars they circle
 posthumus leonatus round as he lies sleeping
sicilius leonatus no more thou thundermaster show
 thy spite on mortal flies
 with mars fall out with juno chide
 that thy adulteries
 rates and revenges
 hath my poor boy done aught but well
 whose face i never saw
 i died whilst in the womb he stay'd
 attending nature's law
 whose father then as men report
 thou orphans father art
 thou shouldst have been and shielded him
 from this earthvexing smart
mother lucina lent not me her aid
 but took me in my throes
 that from me was posthumus ript
 came crying mongst his foes
 a thing of pity
sicilius leonatus great nature like his ancestry
 moulded the stuff so fair
 that he deserved the praise o the world
 as great sicilius heir
first brother when once he was mature for man
 in britain where was he
 that could stand up his parallel
 or fruitful object be
 in eye of imogen that best
 could deem his dignity
mother with marriage wherefore was he mock'd
 to be exiled and thrown
 from leonati seat and cast
 from her his dearest one
 sweet imogen
sicilius leonatus why did you suffer iachimo
 slight thing of italy
 to taint his nobler heart and brain
 with needless jealosy
 and to become the geck and scorn
 o th other's villany
second brother for this from stiller seats we came
 our parents and us twain
 that striking in our country's cause
 fell bravely and were slain
 our fealty and tenantius right
 with honour to maintain
first brother like hardiment posthumus hath
 to cymbeline perform'd
 then jupiter thou king of gods
 why hast thou thus adjourn'd
 the graces for his merits due
 being all to dolours turn'd
sicilius leonatus thy crystal window ope look out
 no longer exercise
 upon a valiant race thy harsh
 and potent injuries
mother since jupiter our son is good
 take off his miseries
sicilius leonatus peep through thy marble mansion help
 or we poor ghosts will cry
 to the shining synod of the rest
 against thy deity
first brother help jupiter or we appeal
 and from thy justice fly
second brother 
 jupiter descends in thunder and lightning sitting
 upon an eagle he throws a thunderbolt the
 apparitions fall on their knees
jupiter no more you petty spirits of region low
 offend our hearing hush how dare you ghosts
 accuse the thunderer whose bolt you know
 skyplanted batters all rebelling coasts
 poor shadows of elysium hence and rest
 upon your neverwithering banks of flowers
 be not with mortal accidents opprest
 no care of yours it is you know tis ours
 whom best i love i cross to make my gift
 the more delay'd delighted be content
 your lowlaid son our godhead will uplift
 his comforts thrive his trials well are spent
 our jovial star reign'd at his birth and in
 our temple was he married rise and fade
 he shall be lord of lady imogen
 and happier much by his affliction made
 this tablet lay upon his breast wherein
 our pleasure his full fortune doth confine
 and so away no further with your din
 express impatience lest you stir up mine
 mount eagle to my palace crystalline
 ascends
sicilius leonatus he came in thunder his celestial breath
 was sulphurous to smell the holy eagle
 stoop'd as to foot us his ascension is
 more sweet than our blest fields his royal bird
 prunes the immortal wing and cloys his beak
 as when his god is pleased
all thanks jupiter
sicilius leonatus the marble pavement closes he is enter'd
 his radiant root away and to be blest
 let us with care perform his great behest
 the apparitions vanish
posthumus leonatus waking sleep thou hast been a grandsire and begot
 a father to me and thou hast created
 a mother and two brothers but o scorn
 gone they went hence so soon as they were born
 and so i am awake poor wretches that depend
 on greatness favour dream as i have done
 wake and find nothing but alas i swerve
 many dream not to find neither deserve
 and yet are steep'd in favours so am i
 that have this golden chance and know not why
 what fairies haunt this ground a book o rare one
 be not as is our fangled world a garment
 nobler than that it covers let thy effects
 so follow to be most unlike our courtiers
 as good as promise
 reads
 when as a lion's whelp shall to himself unknown
 without seeking find and be embraced by a piece of
 tender air and when from a stately cedar shall be
 lopped branches which being dead many years
 shall after revive be jointed to the old stock and
 freshly grow then shall posthumus end his miseries
 britain be fortunate and flourish in peace and plenty'
 tis still a dream or else such stuff as madmen
 tongue and brain not either both or nothing
 or senseless speaking or a speaking such
 as sense cannot untie be what it is
 the action of my life is like it which
 i'll keep if but for sympathy
 reenter first gaoler
first gaoler come sir are you ready for death
posthumus leonatus overroasted rather ready long ago
first gaoler hanging is the word sir if
 you be ready for that you are well cooked
posthumus leonatus so if i prove a good repast to the
 spectators the dish pays the shot
first gaoler a heavy reckoning for you sir but the comfort is
 you shall be called to no more payments fear no
 more tavernbills which are often the sadness of
 parting as the procuring of mirth you come in
 flint for want of meat depart reeling with too
 much drink sorry that you have paid too much and
 sorry that you are paid too much purse and brain
 both empty the brain the heavier for being too
 light the purse too light being drawn of
 heaviness of this contradiction you shall now be
 quit o the charity of a penny cord it sums up
 thousands in a trice you have no true debitor and
 creditor but it of what's past is and to come
 the discharge your neck sir is pen book and
 counters so the acquittance follows
posthumus leonatus i am merrier to die than thou art to live
first gaoler indeed sir he that sleeps feels not the
 toothache but a man that were to sleep your
 sleep and a hangman to help him to bed i think he
 would change places with his officer for look you
 sir you know not which way you shall go
posthumus leonatus yes indeed do i fellow
first gaoler your death has eyes in s head then i have not seen
