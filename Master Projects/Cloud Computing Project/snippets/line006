and behold seven other kine came up after them out of the river ill favoured and leanfleshed and stood by the other kine upon the brink of the river
and the ill favoured and leanfleshed kine did eat up the seven well favoured and fat kine so pharaoh awoke
and he slept and dreamed the second time and behold seven ears of corn came up upon one stalk rank and good
and behold seven thin ears and blasted with the east wind sprung up after them
and the seven thin ears devoured the seven rank and full ears and pharaoh awoke and behold it was a dream
and it came to pass in the morning that his spirit was troubled and he sent and called for all the magicians of egypt and all the wise men thereof and pharaoh told them his dream but there was none that could interpret them unto pharaoh
then spake the chief butler unto pharaoh saying i do remember my faults this day
pharaoh was wroth with his servants and put me in ward in the captain of the guard's house both me and the chief baker
and we dreamed a dream in one night i and he we dreamed each man according to the interpretation of his dream
and there was there with us a young man an hebrew servant to the captain of the guard and we told him and he interpreted to us our dreams to each man according to his dream he did interpret
and it came to pass as he interpreted to us so it was me he restored unto mine office and him he hanged
then pharaoh sent and called joseph and they brought him hastily out of the dungeon and he shaved himself and changed his raiment and came in unto pharaoh
and pharaoh said unto joseph i have dreamed a dream and there is none that can interpret it and i have heard say of thee that thou canst understand a dream to interpret it
and joseph answered pharaoh saying it is not in me god shall give pharaoh an answer of peace
and pharaoh said unto joseph in my dream behold i stood upon the bank of the river
and behold there came up out of the river seven kine fatfleshed and well favoured and they fed in a meadow
and behold seven other kine came up after them poor and very ill favoured and leanfleshed such as i never saw in all the land of egypt for badness
and the lean and the ill favoured kine did eat up the first seven fat kine
and when they had eaten them up it could not be known that they had eaten them but they were still ill favoured as at the beginning so i awoke
and i saw in my dream and behold seven ears came up in one stalk full and good
and behold seven ears withered thin and blasted with the east wind sprung up after them
and the thin ears devoured the seven good ears and i told this unto the magicians but there was none that could declare it to me
and joseph said unto pharaoh the dream of pharaoh is one god hath shewed pharaoh what he is about to do
the seven good kine are seven years and the seven good ears are seven years the dream is one
and the seven thin and ill favoured kine that came up after them are seven years and the seven empty ears blasted with the east wind shall be seven years of famine
this is the thing which i have spoken unto pharaoh what god is about to do he sheweth unto pharaoh
behold there come seven years of great plenty throughout all the land of egypt
and there shall arise after them seven years of famine and all the plenty shall be forgotten in the land of egypt and the famine shall consume the land
and the plenty shall not be known in the land by reason of that famine following for it shall be very grievous
and for that the dream was doubled unto pharaoh twice it is because the thing is established by god and god will shortly bring it to pass
now therefore let pharaoh look out a man discreet and wise and set him over the land of egypt
let pharaoh do this and let him appoint officers over the land and take up the fifth part of the land of egypt in the seven plenteous years
and let them gather all the food of those good years that come and lay up corn under the hand of pharaoh and let them keep food in the cities
and that food shall be for store to the land against the seven years of famine which shall be in the land of egypt that the land perish not through the famine
and the thing was good in the eyes of pharaoh and in the eyes of all his servants
and pharaoh said unto his servants can we find such a one as this is a man in whom the spirit of god is
and pharaoh said unto joseph forasmuch as god hath shewed thee all this there is none so discreet and wise as thou art
thou shalt be over my house and according unto thy word shall all my people be ruled only in the throne will i be greater than thou
and pharaoh said unto joseph see i have set thee over all the land of egypt
and pharaoh took off his ring from his hand and put it upon joseph's hand and arrayed him in vestures of fine linen and put a gold chain about his neck
and he made him to ride in the second chariot which he had and they cried before him bow the knee and he made him ruler over all the land of egypt
and pharaoh said unto joseph i am pharaoh and without thee shall no man lift up his hand or foot in all the land of egypt
and pharaoh called joseph's name zaphnathpaaneah and he gave him to wife asenath the daughter of potipherah priest of on and joseph went out over all the land of egypt
and joseph was thirty years old when he stood before pharaoh king of egypt and joseph went out from the presence of pharaoh and went throughout all the land of egypt
and in the seven plenteous years the earth brought forth by handfuls
and he gathered up all the food of the seven years which were in the land of egypt and laid up the food in the cities the food of the field which was round about every city laid he up in the same
and joseph gathered corn as the sand of the sea very much until he left numbering for it was without number
and unto joseph were born two sons before the years of famine came which asenath the daughter of potipherah priest of on bare unto him
and joseph called the name of the firstborn manasseh for god said he hath made me forget all my toil and all my father's house
and the name of the second called he ephraim for god hath caused me to be fruitful in the land of my affliction
and the seven years of plenteousness that was in the land of egypt were ended
and the seven years of dearth began to come according as joseph had said and the dearth was in all lands but in all the land of egypt there was bread
and when all the land of egypt was famished the people cried to pharaoh for bread and pharaoh said unto all the egyptians go unto joseph what he saith to you do
and the famine was over all the face of the earth and joseph opened all the storehouses and sold unto the egyptians and the famine waxed sore in the land of egypt
and all countries came into egypt to joseph for to buy corn because that the famine was so sore in all lands
now when jacob saw that there was corn in egypt jacob said unto his sons why do ye look one upon another
and he said behold i have heard that there is corn in egypt get you down thither and buy for us from thence that we may live and not die
and joseph's ten brethren went down to buy corn in egypt
but benjamin joseph's brother jacob sent not with his brethren for he said lest peradventure mischief befall him
and the sons of israel came to buy corn among those that came for the famine was in the land of canaan
and joseph was the governor over the land and he it was that sold to all the people of the land and joseph's brethren came and bowed down themselves before him with their faces to the earth
and joseph saw his brethren and he knew them but made himself strange unto them and spake roughly unto them and he said unto them whence come ye and they said from the land of canaan to buy food
and joseph knew his brethren but they knew not him
and joseph remembered the dreams which he dreamed of them and said unto them ye are spies to see the nakedness of the land ye are come
and they said unto him nay my lord but to buy food are thy servants come
we are all one man's sons we are true men thy servants are no spies
and he said unto them nay but to see the nakedness of the land ye are come
and they said thy servants are twelve brethren the sons of one man in the land of canaan and behold the youngest is this day with our father and one is not
and joseph said unto them that is it that i spake unto you saying ye are spies
hereby ye shall be proved by the life of pharaoh ye shall not go forth hence except your youngest brother come hither
send one of you and let him fetch your brother and ye shall be kept in prison that your words may be proved whether there be any truth in you or else by the life of pharaoh surely ye are spies
and he put them all together into ward three days
and joseph said unto them the third day this do and live for i fear god
if ye be true men let one of your brethren be bound in the house of your prison go ye carry corn for the famine of your houses
but bring your youngest brother unto me so shall your words be verified and ye shall not die and they did so
and they said one to another we are verily guilty concerning our brother in that we saw the anguish of his soul when he besought us and we would not hear therefore is this distress come upon us
and reuben answered them saying spake i not unto you saying do not sin against the child and ye would not hear therefore behold also his blood is required
and they knew not that joseph understood them for he spake unto them by an interpreter
and he turned himself about from them and wept and returned to them again and communed with them and took from them simeon and bound him before their eyes
then joseph commanded to fill their sacks with corn and to restore every man's money into his sack and to give them provision for the way and thus did he unto them
and they laded their asses with the corn and departed thence
and as one of them opened his sack to give his ass provender in the inn he espied his money for behold it was in his sack's mouth
and he said unto his brethren my money is restored and lo it is even in my sack and their heart failed them and they were afraid saying one to another what is this that god hath done unto us
and they came unto jacob their father unto the land of canaan and told him all that befell unto them saying
the man who is the lord of the land spake roughly to us and took us for spies of the country
and we said unto him we are true men we are no spies
we be twelve brethren sons of our father one is not and the youngest is this day with our father in the land of canaan
and the man the lord of the country said unto us hereby shall i know that ye are true men leave one of your brethren here with me and take food for the famine of your households and be gone
and bring your youngest brother unto me then shall i know that ye are no spies but that ye are true men so will i deliver you your brother and ye shall traffick in the land
and it came to pass as they emptied their sacks that behold every man's bundle of money was in his sack and when both they and their father saw the bundles of money they were afraid
and jacob their father said unto them me have ye bereaved of my children joseph is not and simeon is not and ye will take benjamin away all these things are against me
and reuben spake unto his father saying slay my two sons if i bring him not to thee deliver him into my hand and i will bring him to thee again
and he said my son shall not go down with you for his brother is dead and he is left alone if mischief befall him by the way in the which ye go then shall ye bring down my gray hairs with sorrow to the grave
and the famine was sore in the land
and it came to pass when they had eaten up the corn which they had brought out of egypt their father said unto them go again buy us a little food
and judah spake unto him saying the man did solemnly protest unto us saying ye shall not see my face except your brother be with you
if thou wilt send our brother with us we will go down and buy thee food
but if thou wilt not send him we will not go down for the man said unto us ye shall not see my face except your brother be with you
and israel said wherefore dealt ye so ill with me as to tell the man whether ye had yet a brother
and they said the man asked us straitly of our state and of our kindred saying is your father yet alive have ye another brother and we told him according to the tenor of these words could we certainly know that he would say bring your brother down
and judah said unto israel his father send the lad with me and we will arise and go that we may live and not die both we and thou and also our little ones
i will be surety for him of my hand shalt thou require him if i bring him not unto thee and set him before thee then let me bear the blame for ever
for except we had lingered surely now we had returned this second time
and their father israel said unto them if it must be so now do this take of the best fruits in the land in your vessels and carry down the man a present a little balm and a little honey spices and myrrh nuts and almonds
and take double money in your hand and the money that was brought again in the mouth of your sacks carry it again in your hand peradventure it was an oversight
take also your brother and arise go again unto the man
and god almighty give you mercy before the man that he may send away your other brother and benjamin if i be bereaved of my children i am bereaved
and the men took that present and they took double money in their hand and benjamin and rose up and went down to egypt and stood before joseph
and when joseph saw benjamin with them he said to the ruler of his house bring these men home and slay and make ready for these men shall dine with me at noon
and the man did as joseph bade and the man brought the men into joseph's house
and the men were afraid because they were brought into joseph's house and they said because of the money that was returned in our sacks at the first time are we brought in that he may seek occasion against us and fall upon us and take us for bondmen and our asses
and they came near to the steward of joseph's house and they communed with him at the door of the house
and said o sir we came indeed down at the first time to buy food
and it came to pass when we came to the inn that we opened our sacks and behold every man's money was in the mouth of his sack our money in full weight and we have brought it again in our hand
and other money have we brought down in our hands to buy food we cannot tell who put our money in our sacks
and he said peace be to you fear not your god and the god of your father hath given you treasure in your sacks i had your money and he brought simeon out unto them
and the man brought the men into joseph's house and gave them water and they washed their feet and he gave their asses provender
and they made ready the present against joseph came at noon for they heard that they should eat bread there
and when joseph came home they brought him the present which was in their hand into the house and bowed themselves to him to the earth
and he asked them of their welfare and said is your father well the old man of whom ye spake is he yet alive
and they answered thy servant our father is in good health he is yet alive and they bowed down their heads and made obeisance
and he lifted up his eyes and saw his brother benjamin his mother's son and said is this your younger brother of whom ye spake unto me and he said god be gracious unto thee my son
and joseph made haste for his bowels did yearn upon his brother and he sought where to weep and he entered into his chamber and wept there
and he washed his face and went out and refrained himself and said set on bread
and they set on for him by himself and for them by themselves and for the egyptians which did eat with him by themselves because the egyptians might not eat bread with the hebrews for that is an abomination unto the egyptians
and they sat before him the firstborn according to his birthright and the youngest according to his youth and the men marvelled one at another
and he took and sent messes unto them from before him but benjamin's mess was five times so much as any of theirs and they drank and were merry with him
and he commanded the steward of his house saying fill the men's sacks with food as much as they can carry and put every man's money in his sack's mouth
and put my cup the silver cup in the sack's mouth of the youngest and his corn money and he did according to the word that joseph had spoken
as soon as the morning was light the men were sent away they and their asses
and when they were gone out of the city and not yet far off joseph said unto his steward up follow after the men and when thou dost overtake them say unto them wherefore have ye rewarded evil for good
is not this it in which my lord drinketh and whereby indeed he divineth ye have done evil in so doing
and he overtook them and he spake unto them these same words
and they said unto him wherefore saith my lord these words god forbid that thy servants should do according to this thing
behold the money which we found in our sacks mouths we brought again unto thee out of the land of canaan how then should we steal out of thy lord's house silver or gold
with whomsoever of thy servants it be found both let him die and we also will be my lord's bondmen
and he said now also let it be according unto your words he with whom it is found shall be my servant and ye shall be blameless
then they speedily took down every man his sack to the ground and opened every man his sack
and he searched and began at the eldest and left at the youngest and the cup was found in benjamin's sack
then they rent their clothes and laded every man his ass and returned to the city
and judah and his brethren came to joseph's house for he was yet there and they fell before him on the ground
and joseph said unto them what deed is this that ye have done wot ye not that such a man as i can certainly divine
and judah said what shall we say unto my lord what shall we speak or how shall we clear ourselves god hath found out the iniquity of thy servants behold we are my lord's servants both we and he also with whom the cup is found
and he said god forbid that i should do so but the man in whose hand the cup is found he shall be my servant and as for you get you up in peace unto your father
then judah came near unto him and said oh my lord let thy servant i pray thee speak a word in my lord's ears and let not thine anger burn against thy servant for thou art even as pharaoh
my lord asked his servants saying have ye a father or a brother
and we said unto my lord we have a father an old man and a child of his old age a little one and his brother is dead and he alone is left of his mother and his father loveth him
and thou saidst unto thy servants bring him down unto me that i may set mine eyes upon him
and we said unto my lord the lad cannot leave his father for if he should leave his father his father would die
and thou saidst unto thy servants except your youngest brother come down with you ye shall see my face no more
and it came to pass when we came up unto thy servant my father we told him the words of my lord
and our father said go again and buy us a little food
and we said we cannot go down if our youngest brother be with us then will we go down for we may not see the man's face except our youngest brother be with us
and thy servant my father said unto us ye know that my wife bare me two sons
and the one went out from me and i said surely he is torn in pieces and i saw him not since
and if ye take this also from me and mischief befall him ye shall bring down my gray hairs with sorrow to the grave
now therefore when i come to thy servant my father and the lad be not with us seeing that his life is bound up in the lad's life
it shall come to pass when he seeth that the lad is not with us that he will die and thy servants shall bring down the gray hairs of thy servant our father with sorrow to the grave
for thy servant became surety for the lad unto my father saying if i bring him not unto thee then i shall bear the blame to my father for ever
now therefore i pray thee let thy servant abide instead of the lad a bondman to my lord and let the lad go up with his brethren
for how shall i go up to my father and the lad be not with me lest peradventure i see the evil that shall come on my father
then joseph could not refrain himself before all them that stood by him and he cried cause every man to go out from me and there stood no man with him while joseph made himself known unto his brethren
and he wept aloud and the egyptians and the house of pharaoh heard
and joseph said unto his brethren i am joseph doth my father yet live and his brethren could not answer him for they were troubled at his presence
and joseph said unto his brethren come near to me i pray you and they came near and he said i am joseph your brother whom ye sold into egypt
now therefore be not grieved nor angry with yourselves that ye sold me hither for god did send me before you to preserve life
for these two years hath the famine been in the land and yet there are five years in the which there shall neither be earing nor harvest
and god sent me before you to preserve you a posterity in the earth and to save your lives by a great deliverance
so now it was not you that sent me hither but god and he hath made me a father to pharaoh and lord of all his house and a ruler throughout all the land of egypt
haste ye and go up to my father and say unto him thus saith thy son joseph god hath made me lord of all egypt come down unto me tarry not
and thou shalt dwell in the land of goshen and thou shalt be near unto me thou and thy children and thy children's children and thy flocks and thy herds and all that thou hast
and there will i nourish thee for yet there are five years of famine lest thou and thy household and all that thou hast come to poverty
and behold your eyes see and the eyes of my brother benjamin that it is my mouth that speaketh unto you
and ye shall tell my father of all my glory in egypt and of all that ye have seen and ye shall haste and bring down my father hither
and he fell upon his brother benjamin's neck and wept and benjamin wept upon his neck
moreover he kissed all his brethren and wept upon them and after that his brethren talked with him
and the fame thereof was heard in pharaoh's house saying joseph's brethren are come and it pleased pharaoh well and his servants
and pharaoh said unto joseph say unto thy brethren this do ye lade your beasts and go get you unto the land of canaan
and take your father and your households and come unto me and i will give you the good of the land of egypt and ye shall eat the fat of the land
now thou art commanded this do ye take you wagons out of the land of egypt for your little ones and for your wives and bring your father and come
also regard not your stuff for the good of all the land of egypt is yours
and the children of israel did so and joseph gave them wagons according to the commandment of pharaoh and gave them provision for the way
to all of them he gave each man changes of raiment but to benjamin he gave three hundred pieces of silver and five changes of raiment
and to his father he sent after this manner ten asses laden with the good things of egypt and ten she asses laden with corn and bread and meat for his father by the way
so he sent his brethren away and they departed and he said unto them see that ye fall not out by the way
and they went up out of egypt and came into the land of canaan unto jacob their father
and told him saying joseph is yet alive and he is governor over all the land of egypt and jacob's heart fainted for he believed them not
and they told him all the words of joseph which he had said unto them and when he saw the wagons which joseph had sent to carry him the spirit of jacob their father revived
and israel said it is enough joseph my son is yet alive i will go and see him before i die
and israel took his journey with all that he had and came to beersheba and offered sacrifices unto the god of his father isaac
and god spake unto israel in the visions of the night and said jacob jacob and he said here am i
and he said i am god the god of thy father fear not to go down into egypt for i will there make of thee a great nation
i will go down with thee into egypt and i will also surely bring thee up again and joseph shall put his hand upon thine eyes
and jacob rose up from beersheba and the sons of israel carried jacob their father and their little ones and their wives in the wagons which pharaoh had sent to carry him
and they took their cattle and their goods which they had gotten in the land of canaan and came into egypt jacob and all his seed with him
his sons and his sons sons with him his daughters and his sons daughters and all his seed brought he with him into egypt
and these are the names of the children of israel which came into egypt jacob and his sons reuben jacob's firstborn
and the sons of reuben hanoch and phallu and hezron and carmi
and the sons of simeon jemuel and jamin and ohad and jachin and zohar and shaul the son of a canaanitish woman
and the sons of levi gershon kohath and merari
