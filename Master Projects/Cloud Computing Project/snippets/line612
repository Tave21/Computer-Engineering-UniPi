 was by the rude hands of that welshman taken
 a thousand of his people butchered
 upon whose dead corpse there was such misuse
 such beastly shameless transformation
 by those welshwomen done as may not be
 without much shame retold or spoken of
king henry iv it seems then that the tidings of this broil
 brake off our business for the holy land
westmoreland this match'd with other did my gracious lord
 for more uneven and unwelcome news
 came from the north and thus it did import
 on holyrood day the gallant hotspur there
 young harry percy and brave archibald
 that evervaliant and approved scot
 at holmedon met
 where they did spend a sad and bloody hour
 as by discharge of their artillery
 and shape of likelihood the news was told
 for he that brought them in the very heat
 and pride of their contention did take horse
 uncertain of the issue any way
king henry iv here is a dear a true industrious friend
 sir walter blunt new lighted from his horse
 stain'd with the variation of each soil
 betwixt that holmedon and this seat of ours
 and he hath brought us smooth and welcome news
 the earl of douglas is discomfited
 ten thousand bold scots two and twenty knights
 balk'd in their own blood did sir walter see
 on holmedon's plains of prisoners hotspur took
 mordake the earl of fife and eldest son
 to beaten douglas and the earl of athol
 of murray angus and menteith
 and is not this an honourable spoil
 a gallant prize ha cousin is it not
westmoreland in faith
 it is a conquest for a prince to boast of
king henry iv yea there thou makest me sad and makest me sin
 in envy that my lord northumberland
 should be the father to so blest a son
 a son who is the theme of honour's tongue
 amongst a grove the very straightest plant
 who is sweet fortune's minion and her pride
 whilst i by looking on the praise of him
 see riot and dishonour stain the brow
 of my young harry o that it could be proved
 that some nighttripping fairy had exchanged
 in cradleclothes our children where they lay
 and call'd mine percy his plantagenet
 then would i have his harry and he mine
 but let him from my thoughts what think you coz
 of this young percy's pride the prisoners
 which he in this adventure hath surprised
 to his own use he keeps and sends me word
 i shall have none but mordake earl of fife
westmoreland this is his uncle's teaching this is worcester
 malevolent to you in all aspects
 which makes him prune himself and bristle up
 the crest of youth against your dignity
king henry iv but i have sent for him to answer this
 and for this cause awhile we must neglect
 our holy purpose to jerusalem
 cousin on wednesday next our council we
 will hold at windsor so inform the lords
 but come yourself with speed to us again
 for more is to be said and to be done
 than out of anger can be uttered
westmoreland i will my liege
 exeunt
 1 king henry iv
act i
scene ii london an apartment of the prince's
 enter the prince of wales and falstaff
falstaff now hal what time of day is it lad
prince henry thou art so fatwitted with drinking of old sack
 and unbuttoning thee after supper and sleeping upon
 benches after noon that thou hast forgotten to
 demand that truly which thou wouldst truly know
 what a devil hast thou to do with the time of the
 day unless hours were cups of sack and minutes
 capons and clocks the tongues of bawds and dials the
 signs of leapinghouses and the blessed sun himself
 a fair hot wench in flamecoloured taffeta i see no
 reason why thou shouldst be so superfluous to demand
 the time of the day
falstaff indeed you come near me now hal for we that take
 purses go by the moon and the seven stars and not
 by phoebus he'that wandering knight so fair and
 i prithee sweet wag when thou art king as god
 save thy gracemajesty i should say for grace
 thou wilt have none
prince henry what none
falstaff no by my troth not so much as will serve to
 prologue to an egg and butter
prince henry well how then come roundly roundly
falstaff marry then sweet wag when thou art king let not
 us that are squires of the night's body be called
 thieves of the day's beauty let us be diana's
 foresters gentlemen of the shade minions of the
 moon and let men say we be men of good government
 being governed as the sea is by our noble and
 chaste mistress the moon under whose countenance we steal
prince henry thou sayest well and it holds well too for the
 fortune of us that are the moon's men doth ebb and
 flow like the sea being governed as the sea is
 by the moon as for proof now a purse of gold
 most resolutely snatched on monday night and most
 dissolutely spent on tuesday morning got with
 swearing lay by and spent with crying bring in'
 now in as low an ebb as the foot of the ladder
 and by and by in as high a flow as the ridge of the gallows
falstaff by the lord thou sayest true lad and is not my
 hostess of the tavern a most sweet wench
prince henry as the honey of hybla my old lad of the castle and
 is not a buff jerkin a most sweet robe of durance
falstaff how now how now mad wag what in thy quips and
 thy quiddities what a plague have i to do with a
 buff jerkin
prince henry why what a pox have i to do with my hostess of the tavern
falstaff well thou hast called her to a reckoning many a
 time and oft
prince henry did i ever call for thee to pay thy part
falstaff no i'll give thee thy due thou hast paid all there
prince henry yea and elsewhere so far as my coin would stretch
 and where it would not i have used my credit
falstaff yea and so used it that were it not here apparent
 that thou art heir apparentbut i prithee sweet
 wag shall there be gallows standing in england when
 thou art king and resolution thus fobbed as it is
 with the rusty curb of old father antic the law do
 not thou when thou art king hang a thief
prince henry no thou shalt
falstaff shall i o rare by the lord i'll be a brave judge
prince henry thou judgest false already i mean thou shalt have
 the hanging of the thieves and so become a rare hangman
falstaff well hal well and in some sort it jumps with my
 humour as well as waiting in the court i can tell
 you
prince henry for obtaining of suits
falstaff yea for obtaining of suits whereof the hangman
 hath no lean wardrobe sblood i am as melancholy
 as a gib cat or a lugged bear
prince henry or an old lion or a lover's lute
falstaff yea or the drone of a lincolnshire bagpipe
prince henry what sayest thou to a hare or the melancholy of
 moorditch
falstaff thou hast the most unsavoury similes and art indeed
 the most comparative rascalliest sweet young
 prince but hal i prithee trouble me no more
 with vanity i would to god thou and i knew where a
 commodity of good names were to be bought an old
 lord of the council rated me the other day in the
 street about you sir but i marked him not and yet
 he talked very wisely but i regarded him not and
 yet he talked wisely and in the street too
prince henry thou didst well for wisdom cries out in the
 streets and no man regards it
falstaff o thou hast damnable iteration and art indeed able
 to corrupt a saint thou hast done much harm upon
 me hal god forgive thee for it before i knew
 thee hal i knew nothing and now am i if a man
 should speak truly little better than one of the
 wicked i must give over this life and i will give
 it over by the lord and i do not i am a villain
 i'll be damned for never a king's son in
 christendom
prince henry where shall we take a purse tomorrow jack
falstaff zounds where thou wilt lad i'll make one an i
 do not call me villain and baffle me
prince henry i see a good amendment of life in thee from praying
 to pursetaking
falstaff why hal tis my vocation hal tis no sin for a
 man to labour in his vocation
 enter poins
 poins now shall we know if gadshill have set a
 match o if men were to be saved by merit what
 hole in hell were hot enough for him this is the
 most omnipotent villain that ever cried stand to
 a true man
prince henry good morrow ned
poins good morrow sweet hal what says monsieur remorse
 what says sir john sack and sugar jack how
 agrees the devil and thee about thy soul that thou
 soldest him on goodfriday last for a cup of madeira
 and a cold capon's leg
prince henry sir john stands to his word the devil shall have
 his bargain for he was never yet a breaker of
 proverbs he will give the devil his due
poins then art thou damned for keeping thy word with the devil
prince henry else he had been damned for cozening the devil
poins but my lads my lads tomorrow morning by four
 o'clock early at gadshill there are pilgrims going
 to canterbury with rich offerings and traders
 riding to london with fat purses i have vizards
 for you all you have horses for yourselves
 gadshill lies tonight in rochester i have bespoke
 supper tomorrow night in eastcheap we may do it
 as secure as sleep if you will go i will stuff
 your purses full of crowns if you will not tarry
 at home and be hanged
