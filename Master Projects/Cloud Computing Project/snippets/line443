 his glassy essence like an angry ape
 plays such fantastic tricks before high heaven
 as make the angels weep who with our spleens
 would all themselves laugh mortal
lucio aside to isabella o to him to him wench he
 will relent
 he's coming i perceive t
provost aside pray heaven she win him
isabella we cannot weigh our brother with ourself
 great men may jest with saints tis wit in them
 but in the less foul profanation
lucio thou'rt i the right girl more o that
isabella that in the captain's but a choleric word
 which in the soldier is flat blasphemy
lucio aside to isabella art avised o that more on t
angelo why do you put these sayings upon me
isabella because authority though it err like others
 hath yet a kind of medicine in itself
 that skins the vice o the top go to your bosom
 knock there and ask your heart what it doth know
 that's like my brother's fault if it confess
 a natural guiltiness such as is his
 let it not sound a thought upon your tongue
 against my brother's life
angelo aside she speaks and tis
 such sense that my sense breeds with it fare you well
isabella gentle my lord turn back
angelo i will bethink me come again tomorrow
isabella hark how i'll bribe you good my lord turn back
angelo how bribe me
isabella ay with such gifts that heaven shall share with you
lucio aside to isabella you had marr'd all else
isabella not with fond shekels of the tested gold
 or stones whose rates are either rich or poor
 as fancy values them but with true prayers
 that shall be up at heaven and enter there
 ere sunrise prayers from preserved souls
 from fasting maids whose minds are dedicate
 to nothing temporal
angelo well come to me tomorrow
lucio aside to isabella go to tis well away
isabella heaven keep your honour safe
angelo aside amen
 for i am that way going to temptation
 where prayers cross
isabella at what hour tomorrow
 shall i attend your lordship
angelo at any time fore noon
isabella save your honour
 exeunt isabella lucio and provost
angelo from thee even from thy virtue
 what's this what's this is this her fault or mine
 the tempter or the tempted who sins most
 ha
 not she nor doth she tempt but it is i
 that lying by the violet in the sun
 do as the carrion does not as the flower
 corrupt with virtuous season can it be
 that modesty may more betray our sense
 than woman's lightness having waste ground enough
 shall we desire to raze the sanctuary
 and pitch our evils there o fie fie fie
 what dost thou or what art thou angelo
 dost thou desire her foully for those things
 that make her good o let her brother live
 thieves for their robbery have authority
 when judges steal themselves what do i love her
 that i desire to hear her speak again
 and feast upon her eyes what is't i dream on
 o cunning enemy that to catch a saint
 with saints dost bait thy hook most dangerous
 is that temptation that doth goad us on
 to sin in loving virtue never could the strumpet
 with all her double vigour art and nature
 once stir my temper but this virtuous maid
 subdues me quite even till now
 when men were fond i smiled and wonder'd how
 exit
 measure for measure
act ii
scene iii a room in a prison
 enter severally duke vincentio disguised as a
 friar and provost
duke vincentio hail to you provost so i think you are
provost i am the provost what's your will good friar
duke vincentio bound by my charity and my blest order
 i come to visit the afflicted spirits
 here in the prison do me the common right
 to let me see them and to make me know
 the nature of their crimes that i may minister
 to them accordingly
provost i would do more than that if more were needful
 enter juliet
 look here comes one a gentlewoman of mine
 who falling in the flaws of her own youth
 hath blister'd her report she is with child
 and he that got it sentenced a young man
 more fit to do another such offence
 than die for this
duke vincentio when must he die
provost as i do think tomorrow
 i have provided for you stay awhile
 to juliet
 and you shall be conducted
duke vincentio repent you fair one of the sin you carry
juliet i do and bear the shame most patiently
duke vincentio i'll teach you how you shall arraign your conscience
 and try your penitence if it be sound
 or hollowly put on
juliet i'll gladly learn
duke vincentio love you the man that wrong'd you
juliet yes as i love the woman that wrong'd him
duke vincentio so then it seems your most offenceful act
 was mutually committed
juliet mutually
duke vincentio then was your sin of heavier kind than his
juliet i do confess it and repent it father
duke vincentio tis meet so daughter but lest you do repent
 as that the sin hath brought you to this shame
 which sorrow is always towards ourselves not heaven
 showing we would not spare heaven as we love it
 but as we stand in fear
juliet i do repent me as it is an evil
 and take the shame with joy
duke vincentio there rest
 your partner as i hear must die tomorrow
 and i am going with instruction to him
 grace go with you benedicite
 exit
juliet must die tomorrow o injurious love
 that respites me a life whose very comfort
 is still a dying horror
provost tis pity of him
 exeunt
 measure for measure
act ii
scene iv a room in angelo's house
 enter angelo
angelo when i would pray and think i think and pray
 to several subjects heaven hath my empty words
 whilst my invention hearing not my tongue
 anchors on isabel heaven in my mouth
 as if i did but only chew his name
 and in my heart the strong and swelling evil
 of my conception the state whereon i studied
 is like a good thing being often read
 grown fear'd and tedious yea my gravity
 whereinlet no man hear mei take pride
 could i with boot change for an idle plume
 which the air beats for vain o place o form
 how often dost thou with thy case thy habit
 wrench awe from fools and tie the wiser souls
 to thy false seeming blood thou art blood
 let's write good angel on the devil's horn
 tis not the devil's crest
 enter a servant
 how now who's there
servant one isabel a sister desires access to you
angelo teach her the way
 exit servant
 o heavens
 why does my blood thus muster to my heart
 making both it unable for itself
 and dispossessing all my other parts
 of necessary fitness
 so play the foolish throngs with one that swoons
 come all to help him and so stop the air
 by which he should revive and even so
 the general subject to a wellwish'd king
 quit their own part and in obsequious fondness
 crowd to his presence where their untaught love
 must needs appear offence
 enter isabella
 how now fair maid
isabella i am come to know your pleasure
angelo that you might know it would much better please me
 than to demand what tis your brother cannot live
isabella even so heaven keep your honour
angelo yet may he live awhile and it may be
 as long as you or i yet he must die
isabella under your sentence
angelo yea
isabella when i beseech you that in his reprieve
 longer or shorter he may be so fitted
 that his soul sicken not
angelo ha fie these filthy vices it were as good
 to pardon him that hath from nature stolen
 a man already made as to remit
 their saucy sweetness that do coin heaven's image
 in stamps that are forbid tis all as easy
 falsely to take away a life true made
 as to put metal in restrained means
 to make a false one
isabella tis set down so in heaven but not in earth
angelo say you so then i shall pose you quickly
 which had you rather that the most just law
 now took your brother's life or to redeem him
 give up your body to such sweet uncleanness
 as she that he hath stain'd
isabella sir believe this
