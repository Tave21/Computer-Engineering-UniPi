 a natural and prompt alacrity
 i find in hardness and do undertake
 these present wars against the ottomites
 most humbly therefore bending to your state
 i crave fit disposition for my wife
 due reference of place and exhibition
 with such accommodation and besort
 as levels with her breeding
duke of venice if you please
 be't at her father's
brabantio i'll not have it so
othello nor i
desdemona nor i i would not there reside
 to put my father in impatient thoughts
 by being in his eye most gracious duke
 to my unfolding lend your prosperous ear
 and let me find a charter in your voice
 to assist my simpleness
duke of venice what would you desdemona
desdemona that i did love the moor to live with him
 my downright violence and storm of fortunes
 may trumpet to the world my heart's subdued
 even to the very quality of my lord
 i saw othello's visage in his mind
 and to his honour and his valiant parts
 did i my soul and fortunes consecrate
 so that dear lords if i be left behind
 a moth of peace and he go to the war
 the rites for which i love him are bereft me
 and i a heavy interim shall support
 by his dear absence let me go with him
othello let her have your voices
 vouch with me heaven i therefore beg it not
 to please the palate of my appetite
 nor to comply with heatthe young affects
 in me defunctand proper satisfaction
 but to be free and bounteous to her mind
 and heaven defend your good souls that you think
 i will your serious and great business scant
 for she is with me no when lightwing'd toys
 of feather'd cupid seal with wanton dullness
 my speculative and officed instruments
 that my disports corrupt and taint my business
 let housewives make a skillet of my helm
 and all indign and base adversities
 make head against my estimation
duke of venice be it as you shall privately determine
 either for her stay or going the affair cries haste
 and speed must answer it
first senator you must away tonight
othello with all my heart
duke of venice at nine i the morning here we'll meet again
 othello leave some officer behind
 and he shall our commission bring to you
 with such things else of quality and respect
 as doth import you
othello so please your grace my ancient
 a man he is of honest and trust
 to his conveyance i assign my wife
 with what else needful your good grace shall think
 to be sent after me
duke of venice let it be so
 good night to every one
 to brabantio
 and noble signior
 if virtue no delighted beauty lack
 your soninlaw is far more fair than black
first senator adieu brave moor use desdemona well
brabantio look to her moor if thou hast eyes to see
 she has deceived her father and may thee
 exeunt duke of venice senators officers &c
othello my life upon her faith honest iago
 my desdemona must i leave to thee
 i prithee let thy wife attend on her
 and bring them after in the best advantage
 come desdemona i have but an hour
 of love of worldly matters and direction
 to spend with thee we must obey the time
 exeunt othello and desdemona
roderigo iago
iago what say'st thou noble heart
roderigo what will i do thinkest thou
iago why go to bed and sleep
roderigo i will incontinently drown myself
iago if thou dost i shall never love thee after why
 thou silly gentleman
roderigo it is silliness to live when to live is torment and
 then have we a prescription to die when death is our physician
iago o villainous i have looked upon the world for four
 times seven years and since i could distinguish
 betwixt a benefit and an injury i never found man
 that knew how to love himself ere i would say i
 would drown myself for the love of a guineahen i
 would change my humanity with a baboon
roderigo what should i do i confess it is my shame to be so
 fond but it is not in my virtue to amend it
iago virtue a fig tis in ourselves that we are thus
 or thus our bodies are our gardens to the which
 our wills are gardeners so that if we will plant
 nettles or sow lettuce set hyssop and weed up
 thyme supply it with one gender of herbs or
 distract it with many either to have it sterile
 with idleness or manured with industry why the
 power and corrigible authority of this lies in our
 wills if the balance of our lives had not one
 scale of reason to poise another of sensuality the
 blood and baseness of our natures would conduct us
 to most preposterous conclusions but we have
 reason to cool our raging motions our carnal
 stings our unbitted lusts whereof i take this that
 you call love to be a sect or scion
roderigo it cannot be
iago it is merely a lust of the blood and a permission of
 the will come be a man drown thyself drown
 cats and blind puppies i have professed me thy
 friend and i confess me knit to thy deserving with
 cables of perdurable toughness i could never
 better stead thee than now put money in thy
 purse follow thou the wars defeat thy favour with
 an usurped beard i say put money in thy purse it
 cannot be that desdemona should long continue her
 love to the moor put money in thy pursenor he
 his to her it was a violent commencement and thou
 shalt see an answerable sequestrationput but
 money in thy purse these moors are changeable in
 their wills fill thy purse with moneythe food
 that to him now is as luscious as locusts shall be
 to him shortly as bitter as coloquintida she must
 change for youth when she is sated with his body
 she will find the error of her choice she must
 have change she must therefore put money in thy
 purse if thou wilt needs damn thyself do it a
 more delicate way than drowning make all the money
 thou canst if sanctimony and a frail vow betwixt
 an erring barbarian and a supersubtle venetian not
 too hard for my wits and all the tribe of hell thou
 shalt enjoy her therefore make money a pox of
 drowning thyself it is clean out of the way seek
 thou rather to be hanged in compassing thy joy than
 to be drowned and go without her
roderigo wilt thou be fast to my hopes if i depend on
 the issue
iago thou art sure of mego make moneyi have told
 thee often and i retell thee again and again i
 hate the moor my cause is hearted thine hath no
 less reason let us be conjunctive in our revenge
 against him if thou canst cuckold him thou dost
 thyself a pleasure me a sport there are many
 events in the womb of time which will be delivered
 traverse go provide thy money we will have more
 of this tomorrow adieu
roderigo where shall we meet i the morning
iago at my lodging
roderigo i'll be with thee betimes
iago go to farewell do you hear roderigo
roderigo what say you
iago no more of drowning do you hear
roderigo i am changed i'll go sell all my land
 exit
iago thus do i ever make my fool my purse
 for i mine own gain'd knowledge should profane
 if i would time expend with such a snipe
 but for my sport and profit i hate the moor
 and it is thought abroad that twixt my sheets
 he has done my office i know not if't be true
 but i for mere suspicion in that kind
 will do as if for surety he holds me well
 the better shall my purpose work on him
 cassio's a proper man let me see now
 to get his place and to plume up my will
 in double knaveryhow how let's see
 after some time to abuse othello's ear
 that he is too familiar with his wife
 he hath a person and a smooth dispose
 to be suspected framed to make women false
 the moor is of a free and open nature
 that thinks men honest that but seem to be so
 and will as tenderly be led by the nose
 as asses are
 i have't it is engender'd hell and night
 must bring this monstrous birth to the world's light
 exit
 othello
act ii
scene i a seaport in cyprus an open place near the quay
 enter montano and two gentlemen
montano what from the cape can you discern at sea
first gentleman nothing at all it is a highwrought flood
 i cannot twixt the heaven and the main
 descry a sail
montano methinks the wind hath spoke aloud at land
 a fuller blast ne'er shook our battlements
 if it hath ruffian'd so upon the sea
 what ribs of oak when mountains melt on them
 can hold the mortise what shall we hear of this
second gentleman a segregation of the turkish fleet
 for do but stand upon the foaming shore
 the chidden billow seems to pelt the clouds
 the windshaked surge with high and monstrous mane
 seems to cast water on the burning bear
