 begot upon itself born on itself
desdemona heaven keep that monster from othello's mind
emilia lady amen

 and seek to effect it to my uttermost
cassio i humbly thank your ladyship
 exeunt desdemona and emilia

bianca save you friend cassio
cassio what make you from home
 how is it with you my most fair bianca
 i faith sweet love i was coming to your house
bianca and i was going to your lodging cassio
 what keep a week away seven days and nights
 eight score eight hours and lovers absent hours
 more tedious than the dial eight score times
 o weary reckoning
cassio pardon me bianca
 i have this while with leaden thoughts been press'd
 but i shall in a more continuate time
 strike off this score of absence sweet bianca
 giving her desdemona's handkerchief
 take me this work out
bianca o cassio whence came this
 this is some token from a newer friend
 to the felt absence now i feel a cause
 is't come to this well well
cassio go to woman
 throw your vile guesses in the devil's teeth
 from whence you have them you are jealous now
 that this is from some mistress some remembrance
 no in good troth bianca
bianca why whose is it
cassio i know not sweet i found it in my chamber
 i like the work well ere it be demanded
 as like enough it willi'ld have it copied
 take it and do't and leave me for this time
bianca leave you wherefore

 and think it no addition nor my wish
 to have him see me woman'd
bianca why i pray you
cassio not that i love you not
bianca but that you do not love me
 i pray you bring me on the way a little
 and say if i shall see you soon at night
cassio tis but a little way that i can bring you
 for i attend here but i'll see you soon
bianca tis very good i must be circumstanced
 exeunt
 othello
act iv
scene i cyprus before the castle
 enter othello and iago
iago will you think so
othello think so iago
iago what
 to kiss in private
othello an unauthorized kiss
iago or to be naked with her friend in bed
 an hour or more not meaning any harm
othello naked in bed iago and not mean harm
 it is hypocrisy against the devil
 they that mean virtuously and yet do so
 the devil their virtue tempts and they tempt heaven
iago so they do nothing tis a venial slip
 but if i give my wife a handkerchief
othello what then
iago why then tis hers my lord and being hers
 she may i think bestow't on any man
othello she is protectress of her honour too
 may she give that
iago her honour is an essence that's not seen
 they have it very oft that have it not
 but for the handkerchief
othello by heaven i would most gladly have forgot it
 thou said'st it comes o'er my memory
 as doth the raven o'er the infected house
 boding to allhe had my handkerchief
iago ay what of that
othello that's not so good now
iago what
 if i had said i had seen him do you wrong
 or heard him sayas knaves be such abroad
 who having by their own importunate suit
 or voluntary dotage of some mistress
 convinced or supplied them cannot choose
 but they must blab
othello hath he said any thing
iago he hath my lord but be you well assured
 no more than he'll unswear
othello what hath he said
iago faith that he didi know not what he did
othello what what
iago lie
othello with her
iago with her on her what you will
othello lie with her lie on her we say lie on her when
 they belie her lie with her that's fulsome
 handkerchiefconfessionshandkerchiefto
 confess and be hanged for his labourfirst to be
 hanged and then to confessi tremble at it
 nature would not invest herself in such shadowing
 passion without some instruction it is not words
 that shake me thus pish noses ears and lips
 is't possibleconfesshandkerchiefo devil
 falls in a trance
iago work on
 my medicine work thus credulous fools are caught
 and many worthy and chaste dames even thus
 all guiltless meet reproach what ho my lord
 my lord i say othello
 enter cassio
 how now cassio
cassio what's the matter
iago my lord is fall'n into an epilepsy
 this is his second fit he had one yesterday
cassio rub him about the temples
iago no forbear
 the lethargy must have his quiet course
 if not he foams at mouth and by and by
 breaks out to savage madness look he stirs
 do you withdraw yourself a little while
 he will recover straight when he is gone
 i would on great occasion speak with you
 exit cassio
 how is it general have you not hurt your head
othello dost thou mock me
iago i mock you no by heaven
 would you would bear your fortune like a man
othello a horned man's a monster and a beast
iago there's many a beast then in a populous city
 and many a civil monster
othello did he confess it
iago good sir be a man
 think every bearded fellow that's but yoked
 may draw with you there's millions now alive
 that nightly lie in those unproper beds
 which they dare swear peculiar your case is better
 o tis the spite of hell the fiend's archmock
 to lip a wanton in a secure couch
 and to suppose her chaste no let me know
 and knowing what i am i know what she shall be
othello o thou art wise tis certain
iago stand you awhile apart
 confine yourself but in a patient list
 whilst you were here o'erwhelmed with your grief
 a passion most unsuiting such a man
 cassio came hither i shifted him away
 and laid good scuse upon your ecstasy
 bade him anon return and here speak with me
 the which he promised do but encave yourself
 and mark the fleers the gibes and notable scorns
 that dwell in every region of his face
 for i will make him tell the tale anew
 where how how oft how long ago and when
 he hath and is again to cope your wife
 i say but mark his gesture marry patience
 or i shall say you are all in all in spleen
 and nothing of a man
othello dost thou hear iago
 i will be found most cunning in my patience
 butdost thou hearmost bloody
iago that's not amiss
 but yet keep time in all will you withdraw
 othello retires
 now will i question cassio of bianca
 a housewife that by selling her desires
 buys herself bread and clothes it is a creature
 that dotes on cassio as tis the strumpet's plague
 to beguile many and be beguiled by one
 he when he hears of her cannot refrain
 from the excess of laughter here he comes
 reenter cassio
 as he shall smile othello shall go mad
 and his unbookish jealousy must construe
 poor cassio's smiles gestures and light behavior
 quite in the wrong how do you now lieutenant
cassio the worser that you give me the addition
 whose want even kills me
iago ply desdemona well and you are sure on't
 speaking lower
 now if this suit lay in bianco's power
 how quickly should you speed
cassio alas poor caitiff
othello look how he laughs already
iago i never knew woman love man so
cassio alas poor rogue i think i faith she loves me
othello now he denies it faintly and laughs it out
iago do you hear cassio
othello now he importunes him
 to tell it o'er go to well said well said
iago she gives it out that you shall marry hey
 do you intend it
cassio ha ha ha
othello do you triumph roman do you triumph
cassio i marry her what a customer prithee bear some
 charity to my wit do not think it so unwholesome
 ha ha ha
