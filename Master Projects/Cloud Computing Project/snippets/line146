as we have therefore opportunity let us do good unto all men especially unto them who are of the household of faith
ye see how large a letter i have written unto you with mine own hand
as many as desire to make a fair shew in the flesh they constrain you to be circumcised only lest they should suffer persecution for the cross of christ
for neither they themselves who are circumcised keep the law but desire to have you circumcised that they may glory in your flesh
but god forbid that i should glory save in the cross of our lord jesus christ by whom the world is crucified unto me and i unto the world
for in christ jesus neither circumcision availeth any thing nor uncircumcision but a new creature
and as many as walk according to this rule peace be on them and mercy and upon the israel of god
from henceforth let no man trouble me for i bear in my body the marks of the lord jesus
brethren the grace of our lord jesus christ be with your spirit amen
paul an apostle of jesus christ by the will of god to the saints which are at ephesus and to the faithful in christ jesus
grace be to you and peace from god our father and from the lord jesus christ
blessed be the god and father of our lord jesus christ who hath blessed us with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places in christ
according as he hath chosen us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and without blame before him in love
having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by jesus christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will
to the praise of the glory of his grace wherein he hath made us accepted in the beloved
in whom we have redemption through his blood the forgiveness of sins according to the riches of his grace
wherein he hath abounded toward us in all wisdom and prudence
having made known unto us the mystery of his will according to his good pleasure which he hath purposed in himself
that in the dispensation of the fulness of times he might gather together in one all things in christ both which are in heaven and which are on earth even in him
in whom also we have obtained an inheritance being predestinated according to the purpose of him who worketh all things after the counsel of his own will
that we should be to the praise of his glory who first trusted in christ
in whom ye also trusted after that ye heard the word of truth the gospel of your salvation in whom also after that ye believed ye were sealed with that holy spirit of promise
which is the earnest of our inheritance until the redemption of the purchased possession unto the praise of his glory
wherefore i also after i heard of your faith in the lord jesus and love unto all the saints
cease not to give thanks for you making mention of you in my prayers
that the god of our lord jesus christ the father of glory may give unto you the spirit of wisdom and revelation in the knowledge of him
the eyes of your understanding being enlightened that ye may know what is the hope of his calling and what the riches of the glory of his inheritance in the saints
and what is the exceeding greatness of his power to usward who believe according to the working of his mighty power
which he wrought in christ when he raised him from the dead and set him at his own right hand in the heavenly places
far above all principality and power and might and dominion and every name that is named not only in this world but also in that which is to come
and hath put all things under his feet and gave him to be the head over all things to the church
which is his body the fulness of him that filleth all in all
and you hath he quickened who were dead in trespasses and sins
wherein in time past ye walked according to the course of this world according to the prince of the power of the air the spirit that now worketh in the children of disobedience
among whom also we all had our conversation in times past in the lusts of our flesh fulfilling the desires of the flesh and of the mind and were by nature the children of wrath even as others
but god who is rich in mercy for his great love wherewith he loved us
even when we were dead in sins hath quickened us together with christ by grace ye are saved
and hath raised us up together and made us sit together in heavenly places in christ jesus
that in the ages to come he might shew the exceeding riches of his grace in his kindness toward us through christ jesus
for by grace are ye saved through faith and that not of yourselves it is the gift of god
not of works lest any man should boast
for we are his workmanship created in christ jesus unto good works which god hath before ordained that we should walk in them
wherefore remember that ye being in time past gentiles in the flesh who are called uncircumcision by that which is called the circumcision in the flesh made by hands
that at that time ye were without christ being aliens from the commonwealth of israel and strangers from the covenants of promise having no hope and without god in the world
but now in christ jesus ye who sometimes were far off are made nigh by the blood of christ
for he is our peace who hath made both one and hath broken down the middle wall of partition between us
having abolished in his flesh the enmity even the law of commandments contained in ordinances for to make in himself of twain one new man so making peace
and that he might reconcile both unto god in one body by the cross having slain the enmity thereby
and came and preached peace to you which were afar off and to them that were nigh
for through him we both have access by one spirit unto the father
now therefore ye are no more strangers and foreigners but fellowcitizens with the saints and of the household of god
and are built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets jesus christ himself being the chief corner stone
in whom all the building fitly framed together groweth unto an holy temple in the lord
in whom ye also are builded together for an habitation of god through the spirit
for this cause i paul the prisoner of jesus christ for you gentiles
if ye have heard of the dispensation of the grace of god which is given me to youward
how that by revelation he made known unto me the mystery as i wrote afore in few words
whereby when ye read ye may understand my knowledge in the mystery of christ
which in other ages was not made known unto the sons of men as it is now revealed unto his holy apostles and prophets by the spirit
that the gentiles should be fellowheirs and of the same body and partakers of his promise in christ by the gospel
whereof i was made a minister according to the gift of the grace of god given unto me by the effectual working of his power
unto me who am less than the least of all saints is this grace given that i should preach among the gentiles the unsearchable riches of christ
and to make all men see what is the fellowship of the mystery which from the beginning of the world hath been hid in god who created all things by jesus christ
to the intent that now unto the principalities and powers in heavenly places might be known by the church the manifold wisdom of god
according to the eternal purpose which he purposed in christ jesus our lord
in whom we have boldness and access with confidence by the faith of him
wherefore i desire that ye faint not at my tribulations for you which is your glory
for this cause i bow my knees unto the father of our lord jesus christ
of whom the whole family in heaven and earth is named
that he would grant you according to the riches of his glory to be strengthened with might by his spirit in the inner man
that christ may dwell in your hearts by faith that ye being rooted and grounded in love
may be able to comprehend with all saints what is the breadth and length and depth and height
and to know the love of christ which passeth knowledge that ye might be filled with all the fulness of god
now unto him that is able to do exceeding abundantly above all that we ask or think according to the power that worketh in us
unto him be glory in the church by christ jesus throughout all ages world without end amen
i therefore the prisoner of the lord beseech you that ye walk worthy of the vocation wherewith ye are called
with all lowliness and meekness with longsuffering forbearing one another in love
endeavouring to keep the unity of the spirit in the bond of peace
there is one body and one spirit even as ye are called in one hope of your calling
one lord one faith one baptism
one god and father of all who is above all and through all and in you all
but unto every one of us is given grace according to the measure of the gift of christ
wherefore he saith when he ascended up on high he led captivity captive and gave gifts unto men
now that he ascended what is it but that he also descended first into the lower parts of the earth
he that descended is the same also that ascended up far above all heavens that he might fill all things
and he gave some apostles and some prophets and some evangelists and some pastors and teachers
for the perfecting of the saints for the work of the ministry for the edifying of the body of christ
till we all come in the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the son of god unto a perfect man unto the measure of the stature of the fulness of christ
that we henceforth be no more children tossed to and fro and carried about with every wind of doctrine by the sleight of men and cunning craftiness whereby they lie in wait to deceive
but speaking the truth in love may grow up into him in all things which is the head even christ
from whom the whole body fitly joined together and compacted by that which every joint supplieth according to the effectual working in the measure of every part maketh increase of the body unto the edifying of itself in love
this i say therefore and testify in the lord that ye henceforth walk not as other gentiles walk in the vanity of their mind
having the understanding darkened being alienated from the life of god through the ignorance that is in them because of the blindness of their heart
who being past feeling have given themselves over unto lasciviousness to work all uncleanness with greediness
but ye have not so learned christ
if so be that ye have heard him and have been taught by him as the truth is in jesus
that ye put off concerning the former conversation the old man which is corrupt according to the deceitful lusts
and be renewed in the spirit of your mind
and that ye put on the new man which after god is created in righteousness and true holiness
wherefore putting away lying speak every man truth with his neighbour for we are members one of another
be ye angry and sin not let not the sun go down upon your wrath
neither give place to the devil
let him that stole steal no more but rather let him labour working with his hands the thing which is good that he may have to give to him that needeth
let no corrupt communication proceed out of your mouth but that which is good to the use of edifying that it may minister grace unto the hearers
and grieve not the holy spirit of god whereby ye are sealed unto the day of redemption
let all bitterness and wrath and anger and clamour and evil speaking be put away from you with all malice
and be ye kind one to another tenderhearted forgiving one another even as god for christ's sake hath forgiven you
be ye therefore followers of god as dear children
and walk in love as christ also hath loved us and hath given himself for us an offering and a sacrifice to god for a sweetsmelling savour
but fornication and all uncleanness or covetousness let it not be once named among you as becometh saints
neither filthiness nor foolish talking nor jesting which are not convenient but rather giving of thanks
for this ye know that no whoremonger nor unclean person nor covetous man who is an idolater hath any inheritance in the kingdom of christ and of god
let no man deceive you with vain words for because of these things cometh the wrath of god upon the children of disobedience
be not ye therefore partakers with them
for ye were sometimes darkness but now are ye light in the lord walk as children of light
for the fruit of the spirit is in all goodness and righteousness and truth
proving what is acceptable unto the lord
and have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness but rather reprove them
for it is a shame even to speak of those things which are done of them in secret
but all things that are reproved are made manifest by the light for whatsoever doth make manifest is light
wherefore he saith awake thou that sleepest and arise from the dead and christ shall give thee light
see then that ye walk circumspectly not as fools but as wise
redeeming the time because the days are evil
wherefore be ye not unwise but understanding what the will of the lord is
and be not drunk with wine wherein is excess but be filled with the spirit
speaking to yourselves in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs singing and making melody in your heart to the lord
giving thanks always for all things unto god and the father in the name of our lord jesus christ
submitting yourselves one to another in the fear of god
wives submit yourselves unto your own husbands as unto the lord
for the husband is the head of the wife even as christ is the head of the church and he is the saviour of the body
therefore as the church is subject unto christ so let the wives be to their own husbands in every thing
husbands love your wives even as christ also loved the church and gave himself for it
that he might sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of water by the word
that he might present it to himself a glorious church not having spot or wrinkle or any such thing but that it should be holy and without blemish
so ought men to love their wives as their own bodies he that loveth his wife loveth himself
for no man ever yet hated his own flesh but nourisheth and cherisheth it even as the lord the church
for we are members of his body of his flesh and of his bones
for this cause shall a man leave his father and mother and shall be joined unto his wife and they two shall be one flesh
this is a great mystery but i speak concerning christ and the church
nevertheless let every one of you in particular so love his wife even as himself and the wife see that she reverence her husband
children obey your parents in the lord for this is right
honour thy father and mother which is the first commandment with promise
that it may be well with thee and thou mayest live long on the earth
and ye fathers provoke not your children to wrath but bring them up in the nurture and admonition of the lord
servants be obedient to them that are your masters according to the flesh with fear and trembling in singleness of your heart as unto christ
not with eyeservice as menpleasers but as the servants of christ doing the will of god from the heart
with good will doing service as to the lord and not to men
knowing that whatsoever good thing any man doeth the same shall he receive of the lord whether he be bond or free
and ye masters do the same things unto them forbearing threatening knowing that your master also is in heaven neither is there respect of persons with him
finally my brethren be strong in the lord and in the power of his might
put on the whole armour of god that ye may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil
for we wrestle not against flesh and blood but against principalities against powers against the rulers of the darkness of this world against spiritual wickedness in high places
wherefore take unto you the whole armour of god that ye may be able to withstand in the evil day and having done all to stand
stand therefore having your loins girt about with truth and having on the breastplate of righteousness
and your feet shod with the preparation of the gospel of peace
above all taking the shield of faith wherewith ye shall be able to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked
and take the helmet of salvation and the sword of the spirit which is the word of god
praying always with all prayer and supplication in the spirit and watching thereunto with all perseverance and supplication for all saints
and for me that utterance may be given unto me that i may open my mouth boldly to make known the mystery of the gospel
for which i am an ambassador in bonds that therein i may speak boldly as i ought to speak
but that ye also may know my affairs and how i do tychicus a beloved brother and faithful minister in the lord shall make known to you all things
whom i have sent unto you for the same purpose that ye might know our affairs and that he might comfort your hearts
peace be to the brethren and love with faith from god the father and the lord jesus christ
grace be with all them that love our lord jesus christ in sincerity amen
paul and timotheus the servants of jesus christ to all the saints in christ jesus which are at philippi with the bishops and deacons
grace be unto you and peace from god our father and from the lord jesus christ
i thank my god upon every remembrance of you
always in every prayer of mine for you all making request with joy
for your fellowship in the gospel from the first day until now
being confident of this very thing that he which hath begun a good work in you will perform it until the day of jesus christ
even as it is meet for me to think this of you all because i have you in my heart inasmuch as both in my bonds and in the defence and confirmation of the gospel ye all are partakers of my grace
for god is my record how greatly i long after you all in the bowels of jesus christ
and this i pray that your love may abound yet more and more in knowledge and in all judgment
that ye may approve things that are excellent that ye may be sincere and without offence till the day of christ
being filled with the fruits of righteousness which are by jesus christ unto the glory and praise of god
but i would ye should understand brethren that the things which happened unto me have fallen out rather unto the furtherance of the gospel
so that my bonds in christ are manifest in all the palace and in all other places
and many of the brethren in the lord waxing confident by my bonds are much more bold to speak the word without fear
some indeed preach christ even of envy and strife and some also of good will
the one preach christ of contention not sincerely supposing to add affliction to my bonds
but the other of love knowing that i am set for the defence of the gospel
what then notwithstanding every way whether in pretence or in truth christ is preached and i therein do rejoice yea and will rejoice
for i know that this shall turn to my salvation through your prayer and the supply of the spirit of jesus christ
according to my earnest expectation and my hope that in nothing i shall be ashamed but that with all boldness as always so now also christ shall be magnified in my body whether it be by life or by death
for to me to live is christ and to die is gain
but if i live in the flesh this is the fruit of my labour yet what i shall choose i wot not
for i am in a strait betwixt two having a desire to depart and to be with christ which is far better
nevertheless to abide in the flesh is more needful for you
and having this confidence i know that i shall abide and continue with you all for your furtherance and joy of faith
that your rejoicing may be more abundant in jesus christ for me by my coming to you again
only let your conversation be as it becometh the gospel of christ that whether i come and see you or else be absent i may hear of your affairs that ye stand fast in one spirit with one mind striving together for the faith of the gospel
and in nothing terrified by your adversaries which is to them an evident token of perdition but to you of salvation and that of god
for unto you it is given in the behalf of christ not only to believe on him but also to suffer for his sake
having the same conflict which ye saw in me and now hear to be in me
if there be therefore any consolation in christ if any comfort of love if any fellowship of the spirit if any bowels and mercies
fulfil ye my joy that ye be likeminded having the same love being of one accord of one mind
let nothing be done through strife or vainglory but in lowliness of mind let each esteem other better than themselves
look not every man on his own things but every man also on the things of others
let this mind be in you which was also in christ jesus
who being in the form of god thought it not robbery to be equal with god
