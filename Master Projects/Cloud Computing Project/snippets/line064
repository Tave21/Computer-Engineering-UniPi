and the king's servants said unto him behold haman standeth in the court and the king said let him come in
so haman came in and the king said unto him what shall be done unto the man whom the king delighteth to honour now haman thought in his heart to whom would the king delight to do honour more than to myself
and haman answered the king for the man whom the king delighteth to honour
let the royal apparel be brought which the king useth to wear and the horse that the king rideth upon and the crown royal which is set upon his head
and let this apparel and horse be delivered to the hand of one of the king's most noble princes that they may array the man withal whom the king delighteth to honour and bring him on horseback through the street of the city and proclaim before him thus shall it be done to the man whom the king delighteth to honour
then the king said to haman make haste and take the apparel and the horse as thou hast said and do even so to mordecai the jew that sitteth at the king's gate let nothing fail of all that thou hast spoken
then took haman the apparel and the horse and arrayed mordecai and brought him on horseback through the street of the city and proclaimed before him thus shall it be done unto the man whom the king delighteth to honour
and mordecai came again to the king's gate but haman hasted to his house mourning and having his head covered
and haman told zeresh his wife and all his friends every thing that had befallen him then said his wise men and zeresh his wife unto him if mordecai be of the seed of the jews before whom thou hast begun to fall thou shalt not prevail against him but shalt surely fall before him
and while they were yet talking with him came the king's chamberlains and hasted to bring haman unto the banquet that esther had prepared
so the king and haman came to banquet with esther the queen
and the king said again unto esther on the second day at the banquet of wine what is thy petition queen esther and it shall be granted thee and what is thy request and it shall be performed even to the half of the kingdom
then esther the queen answered and said if i have found favour in thy sight o king and if it please the king let my life be given me at my petition and my people at my request
for we are sold i and my people to be destroyed to be slain and to perish but if we had been sold for bondmen and bondwomen i had held my tongue although the enemy could not countervail the king's damage
then the king ahasuerus answered and said unto esther the queen who is he and where is he that durst presume in his heart to do so
and esther said the adversary and enemy is this wicked haman then haman was afraid before the king and the queen
and the king arising from the banquet of wine in his wrath went into the palace garden and haman stood up to make request for his life to esther the queen for he saw that there was evil determined against him by the king
then the king returned out of the palace garden into the place of the banquet of wine and haman was fallen upon the bed whereon esther was then said the king will he force the queen also before me in the house as the word went out of the king's mouth they covered haman's face
and harbonah one of the chamberlains said before the king behold also the gallows fifty cubits high which haman had made for mordecai who had spoken good for the king standeth in the house of haman then the king said hang him thereon
so they hanged haman on the gallows that he had prepared for mordecai then was the king's wrath pacified
on that day did the king ahasuerus give the house of haman the jews enemy unto esther the queen and mordecai came before the king for esther had told what he was unto her
and the king took off his ring which he had taken from haman and gave it unto mordecai and esther set mordecai over the house of haman
and esther spake yet again before the king and fell down at his feet and besought him with tears to put away the mischief of haman the agagite and his device that he had devised against the jews
then the king held out the golden sceptre toward esther so esther arose and stood before the king
and said if it please the king and if i have found favour in his sight and the thing seem right before the king and i be pleasing in his eyes let it be written to reverse the letters devised by haman the son of hammedatha the agagite which he wrote to destroy the jews which are in all the king's provinces
for how can i endure to see the evil that shall come unto my people or how can i endure to see the destruction of my kindred
then the king ahasuerus said unto esther the queen and to mordecai the jew behold i have given esther the house of haman and him they have hanged upon the gallows because he laid his hand upon the jews
write ye also for the jews as it liketh you in the king's name and seal it with the king's ring for the writing which is written in the king's name and sealed with the king's ring may no man reverse
then were the king's scribes called at that time in the third month that is the month sivan on the three and twentieth day thereof and it was written according to all that mordecai commanded unto the jews and to the lieutenants and the deputies and rulers of the provinces which are from india unto ethiopia an hundred twenty and seven provinces unto every province according to the writing thereof and unto every people after their language and to the jews according to their writing and according to their language
and he wrote in the king ahasuerus name and sealed it with the king's ring and sent letters by posts on horseback and riders on mules camels and young dromedaries
wherein the king granted the jews which were in every city to gather themselves together and to stand for their life to destroy to slay and to cause to perish all the power of the people and province that would assault them both little ones and women and to take the spoil of them for a prey
upon one day in all the provinces of king ahasuerus namely upon the thirteenth day of the twelfth month which is the month adar
the copy of the writing for a commandment to be given in every province was published unto all people and that the jews should be ready against that day to avenge themselves on their enemies
so the posts that rode upon mules and camels went out being hastened and pressed on by the king's commandment and the decree was given at shushan the palace
and mordecai went out from the presence of the king in royal apparel of blue and white and with a great crown of gold and with a garment of fine linen and purple and the city of shushan rejoiced and was glad
the jews had light and gladness and joy and honour
and in every province and in every city whithersoever the king's commandment and his decree came the jews had joy and gladness a feast and a good day and many of the people of the land became jews for the fear of the jews fell upon them
now in the twelfth month that is the month adar on the thirteenth day of the same when the king's commandment and his decree drew near to be put in execution in the day that the enemies of the jews hoped to have power over them though it was turned to the contrary that the jews had rule over them that hated them
the jews gathered themselves together in their cities throughout all the provinces of the king ahasuerus to lay hand on such as sought their hurt and no man could withstand them for the fear of them fell upon all people
and all the rulers of the provinces and the lieutenants and the deputies and officers of the king helped the jews because the fear of mordecai fell upon them
for mordecai was great in the king's house and his fame went out throughout all the provinces for this man mordecai waxed greater and greater
thus the jews smote all their enemies with the stroke of the sword and slaughter and destruction and did what they would unto those that hated them
and in shushan the palace the jews slew and destroyed five hundred men
and parshandatha and dalphon and aspatha
and poratha and adalia and aridatha
and parmashta and arisai and aridai and vajezatha
the ten sons of haman the son of hammedatha the enemy of the jews slew they but on the spoil laid they not their hand
on that day the number of those that were slain in shushan the palace was brought before the king
and the king said unto esther the queen the jews have slain and destroyed five hundred men in shushan the palace and the ten sons of haman what have they done in the rest of the king's provinces now what is thy petition and it shall be granted thee or what is thy request further and it shall be done
then said esther if it please the king let it be granted to the jews which are in shushan to do to morrow also according unto this day's decree and let haman's ten sons be hanged upon the gallows
and the king commanded it so to be done and the decree was given at shushan and they hanged haman's ten sons
for the jews that were in shushan gathered themselves together on the fourteenth day also of the month adar and slew three hundred men at shushan but on the prey they laid not their hand
but the other jews that were in the king's provinces gathered themselves together and stood for their lives and had rest from their enemies and slew of their foes seventy and five thousand but they laid not their hands on the prey
on the thirteenth day of the month adar and on the fourteenth day of the same rested they and made it a day of feasting and gladness
but the jews that were at shushan assembled together on the thirteenth day thereof and on the fourteenth thereof and on the fifteenth day of the same they rested and made it a day of feasting and gladness
therefore the jews of the villages that dwelt in the unwalled towns made the fourteenth day of the month adar a day of gladness and feasting and a good day and of sending portions one to another
and mordecai wrote these things and sent letters unto all the jews that were in all the provinces of the king ahasuerus both nigh and far
to stablish this among them that they should keep the fourteenth day of the month adar and the fifteenth day of the same yearly
as the days wherein the jews rested from their enemies and the month which was turned unto them from sorrow to joy and from mourning into a good day that they should make them days of feasting and joy and of sending portions one to another and gifts to the poor
and the jews undertook to do as they had begun and as mordecai had written unto them
because haman the son of hammedatha the agagite the enemy of all the jews had devised against the jews to destroy them and had cast pur that is the lot to consume them and to destroy them
but when esther came before the king he commanded by letters that his wicked device which he devised against the jews should return upon his own head and that he and his sons should be hanged on the gallows
wherefore they called these days purim after the name of pur therefore for all the words of this letter and of that which they had seen concerning this matter and which had come unto them
the jews ordained and took upon them and upon their seed and upon all such as joined themselves unto them so as it should not fail that they would keep these two days according to their writing and according to their appointed time every year
and that these days should be remembered and kept throughout every generation every family every province and every city and that these days of purim should not fail from among the jews nor the memorial of them perish from their seed
then esther the queen the daughter of abihail and mordecai the jew wrote with all authority to confirm this second letter of purim
and he sent the letters unto all the jews to the hundred twenty and seven provinces of the kingdom of ahasuerus with words of peace and truth
to confirm these days of purim in their times appointed according as mordecai the jew and esther the queen had enjoined them and as they had decreed for themselves and for their seed the matters of the fastings and their cry
and the decree of esther confirmed these matters of purim and it was written in the book
and the king ahasuerus laid a tribute upon the land and upon the isles of the sea
and all the acts of his power and of his might and the declaration of the greatness of mordecai whereunto the king advanced him are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of media and persia
for mordecai the jew was next unto king ahasuerus and great among the jews and accepted of the multitude of his brethren seeking the wealth of his people and speaking peace to all his seed
there was a man in the land of uz whose name was job and that man was perfect and upright and one that feared god and eschewed evil
and there were born unto him seven sons and three daughters
his substance also was seven thousand sheep and three thousand camels and five hundred yoke of oxen and five hundred she asses and a very great household so that this man was the greatest of all the men of the east
and his sons went and feasted in their houses every one his day and sent and called for their three sisters to eat and to drink with them
and it was so when the days of their feasting were gone about that job sent and sanctified them and rose up early in the morning and offered burnt offerings according to the number of them all for job said it may be that my sons have sinned and cursed god in their hearts thus did job continually
now there was a day when the sons of god came to present themselves before the lord and satan came also among them
and the lord said unto satan whence comest thou then satan answered the lord and said from going to and fro in the earth and from walking up and down in it
and the lord said unto satan hast thou considered my servant job that there is none like him in the earth a perfect and an upright man one that feareth god and escheweth evil
then satan answered the lord and said doth job fear god for nought
hast not thou made an hedge about him and about his house and about all that he hath on every side thou hast blessed the work of his hands and his substance is increased in the land
but put forth thine hand now and touch all that he hath and he will curse thee to thy face
and the lord said unto satan behold all that he hath is in thy power only upon himself put not forth thine hand so satan went forth from the presence of the lord
and there was a day when his sons and his daughters were eating and drinking wine in their eldest brother's house
and there came a messenger unto job and said the oxen were plowing and the asses feeding beside them
and the sabeans fell upon them and took them away yea they have slain the servants with the edge of the sword and i only am escaped alone to tell thee
while he was yet speaking there came also another and said the fire of god is fallen from heaven and hath burned up the sheep and the servants and consumed them and i only am escaped alone to tell thee
while he was yet speaking there came also another and said the chaldeans made out three bands and fell upon the camels and have carried them away yea and slain the servants with the edge of the sword and i only am escaped alone to tell thee
while he was yet speaking there came also another and said thy sons and thy daughters were eating and drinking wine in their eldest brother's house
and behold there came a great wind from the wilderness and smote the four corners of the house and it fell upon the young men and they are dead and i only am escaped alone to tell thee
then job arose and rent his mantle and shaved his head and fell down upon the ground and worshipped
and said naked came i out of my mother's womb and naked shall i return thither the lord gave and the lord hath taken away blessed be the name of the lord
in all this job sinned not nor charged god foolishly
again there was a day when the sons of god came to present themselves before the lord and satan came also among them to present himself before the lord
and the lord said unto satan from whence comest thou and satan answered the lord and said from going to and fro in the earth and from walking up and down in it
and the lord said unto satan hast thou considered my servant job that there is none like him in the earth a perfect and an upright man one that feareth god and escheweth evil and still he holdeth fast his integrity although thou movedst me against him to destroy him without cause
and satan answered the lord and said skin for skin yea all that a man hath will he give for his life
but put forth thine hand now and touch his bone and his flesh and he will curse thee to thy face
and the lord said unto satan behold he is in thine hand but save his life
so went satan forth from the presence of the lord and smote job with sore boils from the sole of his foot unto his crown
and he took him a potsherd to scrape himself withal and he sat down among the ashes
then said his wife unto him dost thou still retain thine integrity curse god and die
but he said unto her thou speakest as one of the foolish women speaketh what shall we receive good at the hand of god and shall we not receive evil in all this did not job sin with his lips
now when job's three friends heard of all this evil that was come upon him they came every one from his own place eliphaz the temanite and bildad the shuhite and zophar the naamathite for they had made an appointment together to come to mourn with him and to comfort him
and when they lifted up their eyes afar off and knew him not they lifted up their voice and wept and they rent every one his mantle and sprinkled dust upon their heads toward heaven
so they sat down with him upon the ground seven days and seven nights and none spake a word unto him for they saw that his grief was very great
after this opened job his mouth and cursed his day
and job spake and said
let the day perish wherein i was born and the night in which it was said there is a man child conceived
let that day be darkness let not god regard it from above neither let the light shine upon it
let darkness and the shadow of death stain it let a cloud dwell upon it let the blackness of the day terrify it
as for that night let darkness seize upon it let it not be joined unto the days of the year let it not come into the number of the months
lo let that night be solitary let no joyful voice come therein
let them curse it that curse the day who are ready to raise up their mourning
let the stars of the twilight thereof be dark let it look for light but have none neither let it see the dawning of the day
because it shut not up the doors of my mother's womb nor hid sorrow from mine eyes
why died i not from the womb why did i not give up the ghost when i came out of the belly
why did the knees prevent me or why the breasts that i should suck
for now should i have lain still and been quiet i should have slept then had i been at rest
with kings and counsellors of the earth which built desolate places for themselves
or with princes that had gold who filled their houses with silver
or as an hidden untimely birth i had not been as infants which never saw light
there the wicked cease from troubling and there the weary be at rest
there the prisoners rest together they hear not the voice of the oppressor
the small and great are there and the servant is free from his master
wherefore is light given to him that is in misery and life unto the bitter in soul
which long for death but it cometh not and dig for it more than for hid treasures
which rejoice exceedingly and are glad when they can find the grave
why is light given to a man whose way is hid and whom god hath hedged in
for my sighing cometh before i eat and my roarings are poured out like the waters
for the thing which i greatly feared is come upon me and that which i was afraid of is come unto me
i was not in safety neither had i rest neither was i quiet yet trouble came
then eliphaz the temanite answered and said
if we assay to commune with thee wilt thou be grieved but who can withhold himself from speaking
behold thou hast instructed many and thou hast strengthened the weak hands
thy words have upholden him that was falling and thou hast strengthened the feeble knees
but now it is come upon thee and thou faintest it toucheth thee and thou art troubled
is not this thy fear thy confidence thy hope and the uprightness of thy ways
remember i pray thee who ever perished being innocent or where were the righteous cut off
even as i have seen they that plow iniquity and sow wickedness reap the same
by the blast of god they perish and by the breath of his nostrils are they consumed
the roaring of the lion and the voice of the fierce lion and the teeth of the young lions are broken
the old lion perisheth for lack of prey and the stout lion's whelps are scattered abroad
now a thing was secretly brought to me and mine ear received a little thereof
in thoughts from the visions of the night when deep sleep falleth on men
fear came upon me and trembling which made all my bones to shake
then a spirit passed before my face the hair of my flesh stood up
it stood still but i could not discern the form thereof an image was before mine eyes there was silence and i heard a voice saying
shall mortal man be more just than god shall a man be more pure than his maker
behold he put no trust in his servants and his angels he charged with folly
how much less in them that dwell in houses of clay whose foundation is in the dust which are crushed before the moth
they are destroyed from morning to evening they perish for ever without any regarding it
doth not their excellency which is in them go away they die even without wisdom
call now if there be any that will answer thee and to which of the saints wilt thou turn
for wrath killeth the foolish man and envy slayeth the silly one
i have seen the foolish taking root but suddenly i cursed his habitation
his children are far from safety and they are crushed in the gate neither is there any to deliver them
whose harvest the hungry eateth up and taketh it even out of the thorns and the robber swalloweth up their substance
although affliction cometh not forth of the dust neither doth trouble spring out of the ground
yet man is born unto trouble as the sparks fly upward
i would seek unto god and unto god would i commit my cause
which doeth great things and unsearchable marvellous things without number
who giveth rain upon the earth and sendeth waters upon the fields
to set up on high those that be low that those which mourn may be exalted to safety
he disappointeth the devices of the crafty so that their hands cannot perform their enterprise
he taketh the wise in their own craftiness and the counsel of the froward is carried headlong
they meet with darkness in the day time and grope in the noonday as in the night
but he saveth the poor from the sword from their mouth and from the hand of the mighty
so the poor hath hope and iniquity stoppeth her mouth
behold happy is the man whom god correcteth therefore despise not thou the chastening of the almighty
for he maketh sore and bindeth up he woundeth and his hands make whole
he shall deliver thee in six troubles yea in seven there shall no evil touch thee
in famine he shall redeem thee from death and in war from the power of the sword
thou shalt be hid from the scourge of the tongue neither shalt thou be afraid of destruction when it cometh
at destruction and famine thou shalt laugh neither shalt thou be afraid of the beasts of the earth
for thou shalt be in league with the stones of the field and the beasts of the field shall be at peace with thee
and thou shalt know that thy tabernacle shall be in peace and thou shalt visit thy habitation and shalt not sin
thou shalt know also that thy seed shall be great and thine offspring as the grass of the earth
thou shalt come to thy grave in a full age like as a shock of corn cometh in in his season
lo this we have searched it so it is hear it and know thou it for thy good
but job answered and said
oh that my grief were throughly weighed and my calamity laid in the balances together
for now it would be heavier than the sand of the sea therefore my words are swallowed up
for the arrows of the almighty are within me the poison whereof drinketh up my spirit the terrors of god do set themselves in array against me
doth the wild ass bray when he hath grass or loweth the ox over his fodder
can that which is unsavoury be eaten without salt or is there any taste in the white of an egg
the things that my soul refused to touch are as my sorrowful meat
oh that i might have my request and that god would grant me the thing that i long for
even that it would please god to destroy me that he would let loose his hand and cut me off
then should i yet have comfort yea i would harden myself in sorrow let him not spare for i have not concealed the words of the holy one
what is my strength that i should hope and what is mine end that i should prolong my life
is my strength the strength of stones or is my flesh of brass
is not my help in me and is wisdom driven quite from me
to him that is afflicted pity should be shewed from his friend but he forsaketh the fear of the almighty
my brethren have dealt deceitfully as a brook and as the stream of brooks they pass away
which are blackish by reason of the ice and wherein the snow is hid
what time they wax warm they vanish when it is hot they are consumed out of their place
the paths of their way are turned aside they go to nothing and perish
the troops of tema looked the companies of sheba waited for them
