 hath but a losing office and his tongue
 sounds ever after as a sullen bell
 remember'd tolling a departing friend
lord bardolph i cannot think my lord your son is dead
morton i am sorry i should force you to believe
 that which i would to god i had not seen
 but these mine eyes saw him in bloody state
 rendering faint quittance wearied and outbreathed
 to harry monmouth whose swift wrath beat down
 the neverdaunted percy to the earth
 from whence with life he never more sprung up
 in few his death whose spirit lent a fire
 even to the dullest peasant in his camp
 being bruited once took fire and heat away
 from the best temper'd courage in his troops
 for from his metal was his party steel'd
 which once in him abated all the rest
 turn'd on themselves like dull and heavy lead
 and as the thing that's heavy in itself
 upon enforcement flies with greatest speed
 so did our men heavy in hotspur's loss
 lend to this weight such lightness with their fear
 that arrows fled not swifter toward their aim
 than did our soldiers aiming at their safety
 fly from the field then was the noble worcester
 too soon ta'en prisoner and that furious scot
 the bloody douglas whose welllabouring sword
 had three times slain the appearance of the king
 gan vail his stomach and did grace the shame
 of those that turn'd their backs and in his flight
 stumbling in fear was took the sum of all
 is that the king hath won and hath sent out
 a speedy power to encounter you my lord
 under the conduct of young lancaster
 and westmoreland this is the news at full
northumberland for this i shall have time enough to mourn
 in poison there is physic and these news
 having been well that would have made me sick
 being sick have in some measure made me well
 and as the wretch whose feverweaken'd joints
 like strengthless hinges buckle under life
 impatient of his fit breaks like a fire
 out of his keeper's arms even so my limbs
 weaken'd with grief being now enraged with grief
 are thrice themselves hence therefore thou nice crutch
 a scaly gauntlet now with joints of steel
 must glove this hand and hence thou sickly quoif
 thou art a guard too wanton for the head
 which princes flesh'd with conquest aim to hit
 now bind my brows with iron and approach
 the ragged'st hour that time and spite dare bring
 to frown upon the enraged northumberland
 let heaven kiss earth now let not nature's hand
 keep the wild flood confined let order die
 and let this world no longer be a stage
 to feed contention in a lingering act
 but let one spirit of the firstborn cain
 reign in all bosoms that each heart being set
 on bloody courses the rude scene may end
 and darkness be the burier of the dead
travers this strained passion doth you wrong my lord
lord bardolph sweet earl divorce not wisdom from your honour
morton the lives of all your loving complices
 lean on your health the which if you give o'er
 to stormy passion must perforce decay
 you cast the event of war my noble lord
 and summ'd the account of chance before you said
 let us make head it was your presurmise
 that in the dole of blows your son might drop
 you knew he walk'd o'er perils on an edge
 more likely to fall in than to get o'er
 you were advised his flesh was capable
 of wounds and scars and that his forward spirit
 would lift him where most trade of danger ranged
 yet did you say go forth and none of this
 though strongly apprehended could restrain
 the stiffborne action what hath then befallen
 or what hath this bold enterprise brought forth
 more than that being which was like to be
lord bardolph we all that are engaged to this loss
 knew that we ventured on such dangerous seas
 that if we wrought our life twas ten to one
 and yet we ventured for the gain proposed
 choked the respect of likely peril fear'd
 and since we are o'erset venture again
 come we will all put forth body and goods
morton tis more than time and my most noble lord
 i hear for certain and do speak the truth
 the gentle archbishop of york is up
 with wellappointed powers he is a man
 who with a double surety binds his followers
 my lord your son had only but the corpse
 but shadows and the shows of men to fight
 for that same word rebellion did divide
 the action of their bodies from their souls
 and they did fight with queasiness constrain'd
 as men drink potions that their weapons only
 seem'd on our side but for their spirits and souls
 this word rebellion it had froze them up
 as fish are in a pond but now the bishop
 turns insurrection to religion
 supposed sincere and holy in his thoughts
 he's followed both with body and with mind
 and doth enlarge his rising with the blood
 of fair king richard scraped from pomfret stones
 derives from heaven his quarrel and his cause
 tells them he doth bestride a bleeding land
 gasping for life under great bolingbroke
 and more and less do flock to follow him
northumberland i knew of this before but to speak truth
 this present grief had wiped it from my mind
 go in with me and counsel every man
 the aptest way for safety and revenge
 get posts and letters and make friends with speed
 never so few and never yet more need

 2 king henry iv
act i
scene ii london a street
 enter falstaff with his page bearing his sword
 and buckler
falstaff sirrah you giant what says the doctor to my water
page he said sir the water itself was a good healthy
 water but for the party that owed it he might
 have more diseases than he knew for
falstaff men of all sorts take a pride to gird at me the
 brain of this foolishcompounded clay man is not
 able to invent anything that tends to laughter more
 than i invent or is invented on me i am not only
 witty in myself but the cause that wit is in other
 men i do here walk before thee like a sow that
 hath overwhelmed all her litter but one if the
 prince put thee into my service for any other reason
 than to set me off why then i have no judgment
 thou whoreson mandrake thou art fitter to be worn
 in my cap than to wait at my heels i was never
 manned with an agate till now but i will inset you
 neither in gold nor silver but in vile apparel and
 send you back again to your master for a jewel
 the juvenal the prince your master whose chin is
 not yet fledged i will sooner have a beard grow in
 the palm of my hand than he shall get one on his
 cheek and yet he will not stick to say his face is
 a faceroyal god may finish it when he will tis
 not a hair amiss yet he may keep it still at a
 faceroyal for a barber shall never earn sixpence
 out of it and yet he'll be crowing as if he had
 writ man ever since his father was a bachelor he
 may keep his own grace but he's almost out of mine
 i can assure him what said master dombledon about
 the satin for my short cloak and my slops
page he said sir you should procure him better
 assurance than bardolph he would not take his
 band and yours he liked not the security
falstaff let him be damned like the glutton pray god his
 tongue be hotter a whoreson achitophel a rascally
 yeaforsooth knave to bear a gentleman in hand
 and then stand upon security the whoreson
 smoothpates do now wear nothing but high shoes and
 bunches of keys at their girdles and if a man is
 through with them in honest taking up then they
 must stand upon security i had as lief they would
 put ratsbane in my mouth as offer to stop it with
 security i looked a should have sent me two and
 twenty yards of satin as i am a true knight and he
 sends me security well he may sleep in security
 for he hath the horn of abundance and the lightness
 of his wife shines through it and yet cannot he
 see though he have his own lanthorn to light him
 where's bardolph
page he's gone into smithfield to buy your worship a horse
falstaff i bought him in paul's and he'll buy me a horse in
 smithfield an i could get me but a wife in the
 stews i were manned horsed and wived
 enter the lord chiefjustice and servant
page sir here comes the nobleman that committed the
 prince for striking him about bardolph
falstaff wait close i will not see him
lord chiefjustice what's he that goes there
servant falstaff an't please your lordship
lord chiefjustice he that was in question for the robbery
servant he my lord but he hath since done good service at
 shrewsbury and as i hear is now going with some
 charge to the lord john of lancaster
lord chiefjustice what to york call him back again
servant sir john falstaff
falstaff boy tell him i am deaf
page you must speak louder my master is deaf
lord chiefjustice i am sure he is to the hearing of any thing good
 go pluck him by the elbow i must speak with him
servant sir john
falstaff what a young knave and begging is there not
 wars is there not employment doth not the king
 lack subjects do not the rebels need soldiers
 though it be a shame to be on any side but one it
 is worse shame to beg than to be on the worst side
 were it worse than the name of rebellion can tell
 how to make it
servant you mistake me sir
falstaff why sir did i say you were an honest man setting
