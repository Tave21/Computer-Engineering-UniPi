othello amen with all my heart
desdemona if you say so i hope you will not kill me
othello hum
desdemona and yet i fear you for you are fatal then
 when your eyes roll so why i should fear i know not
 since guiltiness i know not but yet i feel i fear
othello think on thy sins
desdemona they are loves i bear to you
othello ay and for that thou diest
desdemona that death's unnatural that kills for loving
 alas why gnaw you so your nether lip
 some bloody passion shakes your very frame
 these are portents but yet i hope i hope
 they do not point on me
othello peace and be still
desdemona i will so what's the matter
othello that handkerchief which i so loved and gave thee
 thou gavest to cassio
desdemona no by my life and soul
 send for the man and ask him
othello sweet soul take heed
 take heed of perjury thou art on thy deathbed
desdemona ay but not yet to die
othello yes presently
 therefore confess thee freely of thy sin
 for to deny each article with oath
 cannot remove nor choke the strong conception
 that i do groan withal thou art to die
desdemona then lord have mercy on me
othello i say amen
desdemona and have you mercy too i never did
 offend you in my life never loved cassio
 but with such general warranty of heaven
 as i might love i never gave him token
othello by heaven i saw my handkerchief in's hand
 o perjured woman thou dost stone my heart
 and makest me call what i intend to do
 a murder which i thought a sacrifice
 i saw the handkerchief
desdemona he found it then
 i never gave it him send for him hither
 let him confess a truth
othello he hath confess'd
desdemona what my lord
othello that he hath used thee
desdemona how unlawfully
othello ay
desdemona he will not say so
othello no his mouth is stopp'd
 honest iago hath ta'en order for't
desdemona o my fear interprets what is he dead
othello had all his hairs been lives my great revenge
 had stomach for them all
desdemona alas he is betray'd and i undone
othello out strumpet weep'st thou for him to my face
desdemona o banish me my lord but kill me not
othello down strumpet
desdemona kill me tomorrow let me live tonight
othello nay if you strive
desdemona but half an hour
othello being done there is no pause
desdemona but while i say one prayer
othello it is too late
 he stifles her
emilia within my lord my lord what ho my lord my lord
othello what noise is this not dead not yet quite dead
 i that am cruel am yet merciful
 i would not have thee linger in thy pain so so
emilia within what ho my lord my lord
othello who's there
emilia within o good my lord i would speak a word with you
othello yes tis emilia by and by she's dead
 tis like she comes to speak of cassio's death
 the noise was here ha no more moving
 still as the grave shall she come in were't good
 i think she stirs againno what's best to do
 if she come in she'll sure speak to my wife
 my wife my wife what wife i have no wife
 o insupportable o heavy hour
 methinks it should be now a huge eclipse
 of sun and moon and that the affrighted globe
 should yawn at alteration
emilia within i do beseech you
 that i may speak with you o good my lord
othello i had forgot thee o come in emilia
 soft by and by let me the curtains draw
 where art thou
 unlocks the door
 enter emilia
 what's the matter with thee now
emilia o my good lord yonder's foul murders done
othello what now
emilia but now my lord
othello it is the very error of the moon
 she comes more nearer earth than she was wont
 and makes men mad
emilia cassio my lord hath kill'd a young venetian
 call'd roderigo
othello roderigo kill'd
 and cassio kill'd
emilia no cassio is not kill'd
othello not cassio kill'd then murder's out of tune
 and sweet revenge grows harsh
desdemona o falsely falsely murder'd
emilia alas what cry is that
othello that what
emilia out and alas that was my lady's voice
 help help ho help o lady speak again
 sweet desdemona o sweet mistress speak
desdemona a guiltless death i die
emilia o who hath done this deed
desdemona nobody i myself farewell
 commend me to my kind lord o farewell
 dies
othello why how should she be murder'd
emilia alas who knows
othello you heard her say herself it was not i
emilia she said so i must needs report the truth
othello she's like a liar gone to burning hell
 twas i that kill'd her
emilia o the more angel she
 and you the blacker devil
othello she turn'd to folly and she was a whore
emilia thou dost belie her and thou art a devil
othello she was false as water
emilia thou art rash as fire to say
 that she was false o she was heavenly true
othello cassio did top her ask thy husband else
 o i were damn'd beneath all depth in hell
 but that i did proceed upon just grounds
 to this extremity thy husband knew it all
emilia my husband
othello thy husband
emilia that she was false to wedlock
othello ay with cassio nay had she been true
 if heaven would make me such another world
 of one entire and perfect chrysolite
 i'ld not have sold her for it
emilia my husband
othello ay twas he that told me first
 an honest man he is and hates the slime
 that sticks on filthy deeds
emilia my husband
othello what needs this iteration woman i say thy husband
emilia o mistress villany hath made mocks with love
 my husband say that she was false
othello he woman
 i say thy husband dost understand the word
 my friend thy husband honest honest iago
emilia if he say so may his pernicious soul
 rot half a grain a day he lies to the heart
 she was too fond of her most filthy bargain
othello ha
emilia do thy worst
 this deed of thine is no more worthy heaven
 than thou wast worthy her
othello peace you were best
emilia thou hast not half that power to do me harm
 as i have to be hurt o gull o dolt
 as ignorant as dirt thou hast done a deed
 i care not for thy sword i'll make thee known
 though i lost twenty liveshelp help ho help
 the moor hath kill'd my mistress murder murder
 enter montano gratiano iago and others
montano what is the matter how now general
emilia o are you come iago you have done well
 that men must lay their murders on your neck
gratiano what is the matter
emilia disprove this villain if thou be'st a man
 he says thou told'st him that his wife was false
 i know thou didst not thou'rt not such a villain
 speak for my heart is full
iago i told him what i thought and told no more
 than what he found himself was apt and true
emilia but did you ever tell him she was false
iago i did
emilia you told a lie an odious damned lie
 upon my soul a lie a wicked lie
 she false with cassiodid you say with cassio
iago with cassio mistress go to charm your tongue
emilia i will not charm my tongue i am bound to speak
 my mistress here lies murder'd in her bed
all o heavens forfend
emilia and your reports have set the murder on
othello nay stare not masters it is true indeed
gratiano tis a strange truth
montano o monstrous act
emilia villany villany villany
 i think upon't i think i smell't o villany
 i thought so theni'll kill myself for grief
 o villany villany
iago what are you mad i charge you get you home
emilia good gentlemen let me have leave to speak
 tis proper i obey him but not now
 perchance iago i will ne'er go home
othello o o o
 he falls on the bed
emilia nay lay thee down and roar
 for thou hast kill'd the sweetest innocent
 that e'er did lift up eye
