cleomenes but of all the burst
 and the eardeafening voice o the oracle
 kin to jove's thunder so surprised my sense
 that i was nothing
dion if the event o the journey
 prove as successful to the queeno be't so
 as it hath been to us rare pleasant speedy
 the time is worth the use on't
cleomenes great apollo
 turn all to the best these proclamations
 so forcing faults upon hermione
 i little like
dion the violent carriage of it
 will clear or end the business when the oracle
 thus by apollo's great divine seal'd up
 shall the contents discover something rare
 even then will rush to knowledge go fresh horses
 and gracious be the issue
 exeunt
 the winter's tale
act iii
scene ii a court of justice
 enter leontes lords and officers
leontes this sessions to our great grief we pronounce
 even pushes gainst our heart the party tried
 the daughter of a king our wife and one
 of us too much beloved let us be clear'd
 of being tyrannous since we so openly
 proceed in justice which shall have due course
 even to the guilt or the purgation
 produce the prisoner
officer it is his highness pleasure that the queen
 appear in person here in court silence
 enter hermione guarded
 paulina and ladies attending
leontes read the indictment
officer reads hermione queen to the worthy
 leontes king of sicilia thou art here accused and
 arraigned of high treason in committing adultery
 with polixenes king of bohemia and conspiring
 with camillo to take away the life of our sovereign
 lord the king thy royal husband the pretence
 whereof being by circumstances partly laid open
 thou hermione contrary to the faith and allegiance
 of a true subject didst counsel and aid them for
 their better safety to fly away by night
hermione since what i am to say must be but that
 which contradicts my accusation and
 the testimony on my part no other
 but what comes from myself it shall scarce boot me
 to say not guilty mine integrity
 being counted falsehood shall as i express it
 be so received but thus if powers divine
 behold our human actions as they do
 i doubt not then but innocence shall make
 false accusation blush and tyranny
 tremble at patience you my lord best know
 who least will seem to do so my past life
 hath been as continent as chaste as true
 as i am now unhappy which is more
 than history can pattern though devised
 and play'd to take spectators for behold me
 a fellow of the royal bed which owe
 a moiety of the throne a great king's daughter
 the mother to a hopeful prince here standing
 to prate and talk for life and honour fore
 who please to come and hear for life i prize it
 as i weigh grief which i would spare for honour
 tis a derivative from me to mine
 and only that i stand for i appeal
 to your own conscience sir before polixenes
 came to your court how i was in your grace
 how merited to be so since he came
 with what encounter so uncurrent i
 have strain'd to appear thus if one jot beyond
 the bound of honour or in act or will
 that way inclining harden'd be the hearts
 of all that hear me and my near'st of kin
 cry fie upon my grave
leontes i ne'er heard yet
 that any of these bolder vices wanted
 less impudence to gainsay what they did
 than to perform it first
hermione that's true enough
 through tis a saying sir not due to me
leontes you will not own it
hermione more than mistress of
 which comes to me in name of fault i must not
 at all acknowledge for polixenes
 with whom i am accused i do confess
 i loved him as in honour he required
 with such a kind of love as might become
 a lady like me with a love even such
 so and no other as yourself commanded
 which not to have done i think had been in me
 both disobedience and ingratitude
 to you and toward your friend whose love had spoke
 even since it could speak from an infant freely
 that it was yours now for conspiracy
 i know not how it tastes though it be dish'd
 for me to try how all i know of it
 is that camillo was an honest man
 and why he left your court the gods themselves
 wotting no more than i are ignorant
leontes you knew of his departure as you know
 what you have underta'en to do in's absence
hermione sir
 you speak a language that i understand not
 my life stands in the level of your dreams
 which i'll lay down
leontes your actions are my dreams
 you had a bastard by polixenes
 and i but dream'd it as you were past all shame
 those of your fact are soso past all truth
 which to deny concerns more than avails for as
 thy brat hath been cast out like to itself
 no father owning itwhich is indeed
 more criminal in thee than itso thou
 shalt feel our justice in whose easiest passage
 look for no less than death
hermione sir spare your threats
 the bug which you would fright me with i seek
 to me can life be no commodity
 the crown and comfort of my life your favour
 i do give lost for i do feel it gone
 but know not how it went my second joy
 and firstfruits of my body from his presence
 i am barr'd like one infectious my third comfort
 starr'd most unluckily is from my breast
 the innocent milk in its most innocent mouth
 haled out to murder myself on every post
 proclaimed a strumpet with immodest hatred
 the childbed privilege denied which longs
 to women of all fashion lastly hurried
 here to this place i the open air before
 i have got strength of limit now my liege
 tell me what blessings i have here alive
 that i should fear to die therefore proceed
 but yet hear this mistake me not no life
 i prize it not a straw but for mine honour
 which i would free if i shall be condemn'd
 upon surmises all proofs sleeping else
 but what your jealousies awake i tell you
 tis rigor and not law your honours all
 i do refer me to the oracle
 apollo be my judge
first lord this your request
 is altogether just therefore bring forth
 and in apollos name his oracle
 exeunt certain officers
hermione the emperor of russia was my father
 o that he were alive and here beholding
 his daughter's trial that he did but see
 the flatness of my misery yet with eyes
 of pity not revenge
 reenter officers with cleomenes and dion
officer you here shall swear upon this sword of justice
 that you cleomenes and dion have
 been both at delphos and from thence have brought
 the seal'dup oracle by the hand deliver'd
 of great apollo's priest and that since then
 you have not dared to break the holy seal
 nor read the secrets in't
cleomenes 
 all this we swear
dion 
leontes break up the seals and read
officer reads hermione is chaste
 polixenes blameless camillo a true subject leontes
 a jealous tyrant his innocent babe truly begotten
 and the king shall live without an heir if that
 which is lost be not found
lords now blessed be the great apollo
hermione praised
leontes hast thou read truth
officer ay my lord even so
 as it is here set down
leontes there is no truth at all i the oracle
 the sessions shall proceed this is mere falsehood
 enter servant
servant my lord the king the king
leontes what is the business
servant o sir i shall be hated to report it
 the prince your son with mere conceit and fear
 of the queen's speed is gone
leontes how gone
servant is dead
leontes apollo's angry and the heavens themselves
 do strike at my injustice
 hermione swoons
 how now there
paulina this news is mortal to the queen look down
 and see what death is doing
leontes take her hence
 her heart is but o'ercharged she will recover
 i have too much believed mine own suspicion
 beseech you tenderly apply to her
 some remedies for life
 exeunt paulina and ladies with hermione
 apollo pardon
