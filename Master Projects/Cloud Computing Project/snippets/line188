act iii
scene iii the same the forum
 enter sicinius and brutus
brutus in this point charge him home that he affects
 tyrannical power if he evade us there
 enforce him with his envy to the people
 and that the spoil got on the antiates
 was ne'er distributed
 enter an aedile
 what will he come
aedile he's coming
brutus how accompanied
aedile with old menenius and those senators
 that always favour'd him
sicinius have you a catalogue
 of all the voices that we have procured
 set down by the poll
aedile i have tis ready
sicinius have you collected them by tribes
aedile i have
sicinius assemble presently the people hither
 and when they bear me say it shall be so
 i the right and strength o the commons be it either
 for death for fine or banishment then let them
 if i say fine cry fine if death cry death'
 insisting on the old prerogative
 and power i the truth o the cause
aedile i shall inform them
brutus and when such time they have begun to cry
 let them not cease but with a din confused
 enforce the present execution
 of what we chance to sentence
aedile very well
sicinius make them be strong and ready for this hint
 when we shall hap to give t them
brutus go about it
 exit aedile
 put him to choler straight he hath been used
 ever to conquer and to have his worth
 of contradiction being once chafed he cannot
 be rein'd again to temperance then he speaks
 what's in his heart and that is there which looks
 with us to break his neck
sicinius well here he comes
 enter coriolanus menenius and cominius
 with senators and patricians
menenius calmly i do beseech you
coriolanus ay as an ostler that for the poorest piece
 will bear the knave by the volume the honour'd gods
 keep rome in safety and the chairs of justice
 supplied with worthy men plant love among s
 throng our large temples with the shows of peace
 and not our streets with war
first senator amen amen
menenius a noble wish
 reenter aedile with citizens
sicinius draw near ye people
aedile list to your tribunes audience peace i say
coriolanus first hear me speak
both tribunes well say peace ho
coriolanus shall i be charged no further than this present
 must all determine here
sicinius i do demand
 if you submit you to the people's voices
 allow their officers and are content
 to suffer lawful censure for such faults
 as shall be proved upon you
coriolanus i am content
menenius lo citizens he says he is content
 the warlike service he has done consider think
 upon the wounds his body bears which show
 like graves i the holy churchyard
coriolanus scratches with briers
 scars to move laughter only
menenius consider further
 that when he speaks not like a citizen
 you find him like a soldier do not take
 his rougher accents for malicious sounds
 but as i say such as become a soldier
 rather than envy you
cominius well well no more
coriolanus what is the matter
 that being pass'd for consul with full voice
 i am so dishonour'd that the very hour
 you take it off again
sicinius answer to us
coriolanus say then tis true i ought so
sicinius we charge you that you have contrived to take
 from rome all season'd office and to wind
 yourself into a power tyrannical
 for which you are a traitor to the people
coriolanus how traitor
menenius nay temperately your promise
coriolanus the fires i the lowest hell foldin the people
 call me their traitor thou injurious tribune
 within thine eyes sat twenty thousand deaths
 in thy hand clutch'd as many millions in
 thy lying tongue both numbers i would say
 thou liest unto thee with a voice as free
 as i do pray the gods
sicinius mark you this people
citizens to the rock to the rock with him
sicinius peace
 we need not put new matter to his charge
 what you have seen him do and heard him speak
 beating your officers cursing yourselves
 opposing laws with strokes and here defying
 those whose great power must try him even this
 so criminal and in such capital kind
 deserves the extremest death
brutus but since he hath
 served well for rome
coriolanus what do you prate of service
brutus i talk of that that know it
coriolanus you
menenius is this the promise that you made your mother
cominius know i pray you
coriolanus i know no further
 let them pronounce the steep tarpeian death
 vagabond exile raying pent to linger
 but with a grain a day i would not buy
 their mercy at the price of one fair word
 nor cheque my courage for what they can give
 to have't with saying good morrow'
sicinius for that he has
 as much as in him lies from time to time
 envied against the people seeking means
 to pluck away their power as now at last
 given hostile strokes and that not in the presence
 of dreaded justice but on the ministers
 that do distribute it in the name o the people
 and in the power of us the tribunes we
 even from this instant banish him our city
 in peril of precipitation
 from off the rock tarpeian never more
 to enter our rome gates i the people's name
 i say it shall be so
citizens it shall be so it shall be so let him away
 he's banish'd and it shall be so
cominius hear me my masters and my common friends
sicinius he's sentenced no more hearing
cominius let me speak
 i have been consul and can show for rome
 her enemies marks upon me i do love
 my country's good with a respect more tender
 more holy and profound than mine own life
 my dear wife's estimate her womb's increase
 and treasure of my loins then if i would
 speak that
sicinius we know your drift speak what
brutus there's no more to be said but he is banish'd
 as enemy to the people and his country
 it shall be so
citizens it shall be so it shall be so
coriolanus you common cry of curs whose breath i hate
 as reek o the rotten fens whose loves i prize
 as the dead carcasses of unburied men
 that do corrupt my air i banish you
 and here remain with your uncertainty
 let every feeble rumour shake your hearts
 your enemies with nodding of their plumes
 fan you into despair have the power still
 to banish your defenders till at length
 your ignorance which finds not till it feels
 making not reservation of yourselves
 still your own foes deliver you as most
 abated captives to some nation
 that won you without blows despising
 for you the city thus i turn my back
 there is a world elsewhere
 exeunt coriolanus cominius menenius senators
 and patricians
aedile the people's enemy is gone is gone
citizens our enemy is banish'd he is gone hoo hoo
 shouting and throwing up their caps
sicinius go see him out at gates and follow him
 as he hath followed you with all despite
 give him deserved vexation let a guard
 attend us through the city
citizens come come let's see him out at gates come
 the gods preserve our noble tribunes come
 exeunt
