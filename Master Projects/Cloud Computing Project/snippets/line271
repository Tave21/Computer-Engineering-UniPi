 may the winds blow till they have waken'd death
 and let the labouring bark climb hills of seas
 olympushigh and duck again as low
 as hell's from heaven if it were now to die
 twere now to be most happy for i fear
 my soul hath her content so absolute
 that not another comfort like to this
 succeeds in unknown fate
desdemona the heavens forbid
 but that our loves and comforts should increase
 even as our days do grow
othello amen to that sweet powers
 i cannot speak enough of this content
 it stops me here it is too much of joy
 and this and this the greatest discords be
 kissing her
 that e'er our hearts shall make
iago aside o you are well tuned now
 but i'll set down the pegs that make this music
 as honest as i am
othello come let us to the castle
 news friends our wars are done the turks
 are drown'd
 how does my old acquaintance of this isle
 honey you shall be well desired in cyprus
 i have found great love amongst them o my sweet
 i prattle out of fashion and i dote
 in mine own comforts i prithee good iago
 go to the bay and disembark my coffers
 bring thou the master to the citadel
 he is a good one and his worthiness
 does challenge much respect come desdemona
 once more well met at cyprus
 exeunt othello desdemona and attendants
iago do thou meet me presently at the harbour come
 hither if thou be'st valiant as they say base
 men being in love have then a nobility in their
 natures more than is native to themlist me the
 lieutenant tonight watches on the court of
 guardfirst i must tell thee thisdesdemona is
 directly in love with him
roderigo with him why tis not possible
iago lay thy finger thus and let thy soul be instructed
 mark me with what violence she first loved the moor
 but for bragging and telling her fantastical lies
 and will she love him still for prating let not
 thy discreet heart think it her eye must be fed
 and what delight shall she have to look on the
 devil when the blood is made dull with the act of
 sport there should be again to inflame it and to
 give satiety a fresh appetite loveliness in favour
 sympathy in years manners and beauties all which
 the moor is defective in now for want of these
 required conveniences her delicate tenderness will
 find itself abused begin to heave the gorge
 disrelish and abhor the moor very nature will
 instruct her in it and compel her to some second
 choice now sir this grantedas it is a most
 pregnant and unforced positionwho stands so
 eminent in the degree of this fortune as cassio
 does a knave very voluble no further
 conscionable than in putting on the mere form of
 civil and humane seeming for the better compassing
 of his salt and most hidden loose affection why
 none why none a slipper and subtle knave a
 finder of occasions that has an eye can stamp and
 counterfeit advantages though true advantage never
 present itself a devilish knave besides the
 knave is handsome young and hath all those
 requisites in him that folly and green minds look
 after a pestilent complete knave and the woman
 hath found him already
roderigo i cannot believe that in her she's full of
 most blessed condition
iago blessed fig'send the wine she drinks is made of
 grapes if she had been blessed she would never
 have loved the moor blessed pudding didst thou
 not see her paddle with the palm of his hand didst
 not mark that
roderigo yes that i did but that was but courtesy
iago lechery by this hand an index and obscure prologue
 to the history of lust and foul thoughts they met
 so near with their lips that their breaths embraced
 together villanous thoughts roderigo when these
 mutualities so marshal the way hard at hand comes
 the master and main exercise the incorporate
 conclusion pish but sir be you ruled by me i
 have brought you from venice watch you tonight
 for the command i'll lay't upon you cassio knows
 you not i'll not be far from you do you find
 some occasion to anger cassio either by speaking
 too loud or tainting his discipline or from what
 other course you please which the time shall more
 favourably minister
roderigo well
iago sir he is rash and very sudden in choler and haply
 may strike at you provoke him that he may for
 even out of that will i cause these of cyprus to
 mutiny whose qualification shall come into no true
 taste again but by the displanting of cassio so
 shall you have a shorter journey to your desires by
 the means i shall then have to prefer them and the
 impediment most profitably removed without the
 which there were no expectation of our prosperity
roderigo i will do this if i can bring it to any
 opportunity
iago i warrant thee meet me by and by at the citadel
 i must fetch his necessaries ashore farewell
roderigo adieu
 exit
iago that cassio loves her i do well believe it
 that she loves him tis apt and of great credit
 the moor howbeit that i endure him not
 is of a constant loving noble nature
 and i dare think he'll prove to desdemona
 a most dear husband now i do love her too
 not out of absolute lust though peradventure
 i stand accountant for as great a sin
 but partly led to diet my revenge
 for that i do suspect the lusty moor
 hath leap'd into my seat the thought whereof
 doth like a poisonous mineral gnaw my inwards
 and nothing can or shall content my soul
 till i am even'd with him wife for wife
 or failing so yet that i put the moor
 at least into a jealousy so strong
 that judgment cannot cure which thing to do
 if this poor trash of venice whom i trash
 for his quick hunting stand the putting on
 i'll have our michael cassio on the hip
 abuse him to the moor in the rank garb
 for i fear cassio with my nightcap too
 make the moor thank me love me and reward me
 for making him egregiously an ass
 and practising upon his peace and quiet
 even to madness tis here but yet confused
 knavery's plain face is never seen tin used
 exit

act ii
scene ii a street
 enter a herald with a proclamation people
 following
herald it is othello's pleasure our noble and valiant
 general that upon certain tidings now arrived
 importing the mere perdition of the turkish fleet
 every man put himself into triumph some to dance
 some to make bonfires each man to what sport and
 revels his addiction leads him for besides these
 beneficial news it is the celebration of his
 nuptial so much was his pleasure should be
 proclaimed all offices are open and there is full
 liberty of feasting from this present hour of five
 till the bell have told eleven heaven bless the
 isle of cyprus and our noble general othello
 exeunt
 othello
act ii
scene iii a hall in the castle
 enter othello desdemona cassio and attendants
othello good michael look you to the guard tonight
 let's teach ourselves that honourable stop
 not to outsport discretion
cassio iago hath direction what to do
 but notwithstanding with my personal eye
 will i look to't
othello iago is most honest
 michael good night tomorrow with your earliest
 let me have speech with you
 to desdemona
 come my dear love
 the purchase made the fruits are to ensue
 that profit's yet to come tween me and you
 good night
 exeunt othello desdemona and attendants
 enter iago
cassio welcome iago we must to the watch
iago not this hour lieutenant tis not yet ten o the
 clock our general cast us thus early for the love
 of his desdemona who let us not therefore blame
 he hath not yet made wanton the night with her and
 she is sport for jove
cassio she's a most exquisite lady
iago and i'll warrant her fun of game
cassio indeed she's a most fresh and delicate creature
iago what an eye she has methinks it sounds a parley of
 provocation
cassio an inviting eye and yet methinks right modest
iago and when she speaks is it not an alarum to love
cassio she is indeed perfection
iago well happiness to their sheets come lieutenant i
 have a stoup of wine and here without are a brace
 of cyprus gallants that would fain have a measure to
 the health of black othello
cassio not tonight good iago i have very poor and
 unhappy brains for drinking i could well wish
 courtesy would invent some other custom of
 entertainment
iago o they are our friends but one cup i'll drink for
 you
