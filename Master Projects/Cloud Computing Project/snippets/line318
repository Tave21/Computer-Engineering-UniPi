 that like the stately phoebe mongst her nymphs
 dost overshine the gallant'st dames of rome
 if thou be pleased with this my sudden choice
 behold i choose thee tamora for my bride
 and will create thee empress of rome
 speak queen of goths dost thou applaud my choice
 and here i swear by all the roman gods
 sith priest and holy water are so near
 and tapers burn so bright and every thing
 in readiness for hymenaeus stand
 i will not resalute the streets of rome
 or climb my palace till from forth this place
 i lead espoused my bride along with me
tamora and here in sight of heaven to rome i swear
 if saturnine advance the queen of goths
 she will a handmaid be to his desires
 a loving nurse a mother to his youth
saturninus ascend fair queen pantheon lords accompany
 your noble emperor and his lovely bride
 sent by the heavens for prince saturnine
 whose wisdom hath her fortune conquered
 there shall we consummate our spousal rites
 exeunt all but titus
titus andronicus i am not bid to wait upon this bride
 titus when wert thou wont to walk alone
 dishonour'd thus and challenged of wrongs
 reenter marcus lucius quintus and martius
marcus andronicus o titus see o see what thou hast done
 in a bad quarrel slain a virtuous son
titus andronicus no foolish tribune no no son of mine
 nor thou nor these confederates in the deed
 that hath dishonour'd all our family
 unworthy brother and unworthy sons
lucius but let us give him burial as becomes
 give mutius burial with our brethren
titus andronicus traitors away he rests not in this tomb
 this monument five hundred years hath stood
 which i have sumptuously reedified
 here none but soldiers and rome's servitors
 repose in fame none basely slain in brawls
 bury him where you can he comes not here
marcus andronicus my lord this is impiety in you
 my nephew mutius deeds do plead for him
 he must be buried with his brethren
quintus 
 and shall or him we will accompany
martius 
titus andronicus and shall what villain was it that spake
 that word
quintus he that would vouch it in any place but here
titus andronicus what would you bury him in my despite
marcus andronicus no noble titus but entreat of thee
 to pardon mutius and to bury him
titus andronicus marcus even thou hast struck upon my crest
 and with these boys mine honour thou hast wounded
 my foes i do repute you every one
 so trouble me no more but get you gone
martius he is not with himself let us withdraw
quintus not i till mutius bones be buried
 marcus and the sons of titus kneel
marcus andronicus brother for in that name doth nature plead
quintus father and in that name doth nature speak
titus andronicus speak thou no more if all the rest will speed
marcus andronicus renowned titus more than half my soul
lucius dear father soul and substance of us all
marcus andronicus suffer thy brother marcus to inter
 his noble nephew here in virtue's nest
 that died in honour and lavinia's cause
 thou art a roman be not barbarous
 the greeks upon advice did bury ajax
 that slew himself and wise laertes son
 did graciously plead for his funerals
 let not young mutius then that was thy joy
 be barr'd his entrance here
titus andronicus rise marcus rise
 the dismall'st day is this that e'er i saw
 to be dishonour'd by my sons in rome
 well bury him and bury me the next
 mutius is put into the tomb
lucius there lie thy bones sweet mutius with thy friends
 till we with trophies do adorn thy tomb
all kneeling no man shed tears for noble mutius
 he lives in fame that died in virtue's cause
marcus andronicus my lord to step out of these dreary dumps
 how comes it that the subtle queen of goths
 is of a sudden thus advanced in rome
titus andronicus i know not marcus but i know it is
 whether by device or no the heavens can tell
 is she not then beholding to the man
 that brought her for this high good turn so far
 yes and will nobly him remunerate
 flourish reenter from one side saturninus
 attended tamora demetrius chiron and aaron from
 the other bassianus lavinia and others
saturninus so bassianus you have play'd your prize
 god give you joy sir of your gallant bride
bassianus and you of yours my lord i say no more
 nor wish no less and so i take my leave
saturninus traitor if rome have law or we have power
 thou and thy faction shall repent this rape
bassianus rape call you it my lord to seize my own
 my truthbetrothed love and now my wife
 but let the laws of rome determine all
 meanwhile i am possess'd of that is mine
saturninus tis good sir you are very short with us
 but if we live we'll be as sharp with you
bassianus my lord what i have done as best i may
 answer i must and shall do with my life
 only thus much i give your grace to know
 by all the duties that i owe to rome
 this noble gentleman lord titus here
 is in opinion and in honour wrong'd
 that in the rescue of lavinia
 with his own hand did slay his youngest son
 in zeal to you and highly moved to wrath
 to be controll'd in that he frankly gave
 receive him then to favor saturnine
 that hath express'd himself in all his deeds
 a father and a friend to thee and rome
titus andronicus prince bassianus leave to plead my deeds
 tis thou and those that have dishonour'd me
 rome and the righteous heavens be my judge
 how i have loved and honour'd saturnine
tamora my worthy lord if ever tamora
 were gracious in those princely eyes of thine
 then hear me speak in indifferently for all
 and at my suit sweet pardon what is past
saturninus what madam be dishonour'd openly
 and basely put it up without revenge
tamora not so my lord the gods of rome forfend
 i should be author to dishonour you
 but on mine honour dare i undertake
 for good lord titus innocence in all
 whose fury not dissembled speaks his griefs
 then at my suit look graciously on him
 lose not so noble a friend on vain suppose
 nor with sour looks afflict his gentle heart
 aside to saturninus my lord be ruled by me
 be won at last
 dissemble all your griefs and discontents
 you are but newly planted in your throne
 lest then the people and patricians too
 upon a just survey take titus part
 and so supplant you for ingratitude
 which rome reputes to be a heinous sin
 yield at entreats and then let me alone
 i'll find a day to massacre them all
 and raze their faction and their family
 the cruel father and his traitorous sons
 to whom i sued for my dear son's life
 and make them know what tis to let a queen
 kneel in the streets and beg for grace in vain
 aloud
 come come sweet emperor come andronicus
 take up this good old man and cheer the heart
 that dies in tempest of thy angry frown
saturninus rise titus rise my empress hath prevail'd
titus andronicus i thank your majesty and her my lord
 these words these looks infuse new life in me
tamora titus i am incorporate in rome
 a roman now adopted happily
 and must advise the emperor for his good
 this day all quarrels die andronicus
 and let it be mine honour good my lord
 that i have reconciled your friends and you
 for you prince bassianus i have pass'd
 my word and promise to the emperor
 that you will be more mild and tractable
 and fear not lords and you lavinia
 by my advice all humbled on your knees
 you shall ask pardon of his majesty
lucius we do and vow to heaven and to his highness
 that what we did was mildly as we might
 tendering our sister's honour and our own
marcus andronicus that on mine honour here i do protest
saturninus away and talk not trouble us no more
tamora nay nay sweet emperor we must all be friends
 the tribune and his nephews kneel for grace
 i will not be denied sweet heart look back
saturninus marcus for thy sake and thy brother's here
 and at my lovely tamora's entreats
 i do remit these young men's heinous faults stand up
 lavinia though you left me like a churl
 i found a friend and sure as death i swore
 i would not part a bachelor from the priest
 come if the emperor's court can feast two brides
 you are my guest lavinia and your friends
 this day shall be a loveday tamora
titus andronicus tomorrow an it please your majesty
 to hunt the panther and the hart with me
 with horn and hound we'll give your grace bonjour
saturninus be it so titus and gramercy too
 flourish exeunt

 safe out of fortune's shot and sits aloft
 secure of thunder's crack or lightning flash
