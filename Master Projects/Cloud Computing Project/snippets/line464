shylock i have possess'd your grace of what i purpose
 and by our holy sabbath have i sworn
 to have the due and forfeit of my bond
 if you deny it let the danger light
 upon your charter and your city's freedom
 you'll ask me why i rather choose to have
 a weight of carrion flesh than to receive
 three thousand ducats i'll not answer that
 but say it is my humour is it answer'd
 what if my house be troubled with a rat
 and i be pleased to give ten thousand ducats
 to have it baned what are you answer'd yet
 some men there are love not a gaping pig
 some that are mad if they behold a cat
 and others when the bagpipe sings i the nose
 cannot contain their urine for affection
 mistress of passion sways it to the mood
 of what it likes or loathes now for your answer
 as there is no firm reason to be render'd
 why he cannot abide a gaping pig
 why he a harmless necessary cat
 why he a woollen bagpipe but of force
 must yield to such inevitable shame
 as to offend himself being offended
 so can i give no reason nor i will not
 more than a lodged hate and a certain loathing
 i bear antonio that i follow thus
 a losing suit against him are you answer'd
bassanio this is no answer thou unfeeling man
 to excuse the current of thy cruelty
shylock i am not bound to please thee with my answers
bassanio do all men kill the things they do not love
shylock hates any man the thing he would not kill
bassanio every offence is not a hate at first
shylock what wouldst thou have a serpent sting thee twice
antonio i pray you think you question with the jew
 you may as well go stand upon the beach
 and bid the main flood bate his usual height
 you may as well use question with the wolf
 why he hath made the ewe bleat for the lamb
 you may as well forbid the mountain pines
 to wag their high tops and to make no noise
 when they are fretten with the gusts of heaven
 you may as well do anything most hard
 as seek to soften thatthan which what's harder
 his jewish heart therefore i do beseech you
 make no more offers use no farther means
 but with all brief and plain conveniency
 let me have judgment and the jew his will
bassanio for thy three thousand ducats here is six
shylock what judgment shall i dread doing
 were in six parts and every part a ducat
 i would not draw them i would have my bond
duke how shalt thou hope for mercy rendering none
shylock what judgment shall i dread doing no wrong
 you have among you many a purchased slave
 which like your asses and your dogs and mules
 you use in abject and in slavish parts
 because you bought them shall i say to you
 let them be free marry them to your heirs
 why sweat they under burthens let their beds
 be made as soft as yours and let their palates
 be season'd with such viands you will answer
 the slaves are ours so do i answer you
 the pound of flesh which i demand of him
 is dearly bought tis mine and i will have it
 if you deny me fie upon your law
 there is no force in the decrees of venice
 i stand for judgment answer shall i have it
duke upon my power i may dismiss this court
 unless bellario a learned doctor
 whom i have sent for to determine this
 come here today
salerio my lord here stays without
 a messenger with letters from the doctor
 new come from padua
duke bring us the letter call the messenger
bassanio good cheer antonio what man courage yet
 the jew shall have my flesh blood bones and all
 ere thou shalt lose for me one drop of blood
antonio i am a tainted wether of the flock
 meetest for death the weakest kind of fruit
 drops earliest to the ground and so let me
 you cannot better be employ'd bassanio
 than to live still and write mine epitaph
 enter nerissa dressed like a lawyer's clerk
duke came you from padua from bellario
nerissa from both my lord bellario greets your grace
 presenting a letter
bassanio why dost thou whet thy knife so earnestly
shylock to cut the forfeiture from that bankrupt there
gratiano not on thy sole but on thy soul harsh jew
 thou makest thy knife keen but no metal can
 no not the hangman's axe bear half the keenness
 of thy sharp envy can no prayers pierce thee
shylock no none that thou hast wit enough to make
gratiano o be thou damn'd inexecrable dog
 and for thy life let justice be accused
 thou almost makest me waver in my faith
 to hold opinion with pythagoras
 that souls of animals infuse themselves
 into the trunks of men thy currish spirit
 govern'd a wolf who hang'd for human slaughter
 even from the gallows did his fell soul fleet
 and whilst thou lay'st in thy unhallow'd dam
 infused itself in thee for thy desires
 are wolvish bloody starved and ravenous
shylock till thou canst rail the seal from off my bond
 thou but offend'st thy lungs to speak so loud
 repair thy wit good youth or it will fall
 to cureless ruin i stand here for law
duke this letter from bellario doth commend
 a young and learned doctor to our court
 where is he
nerissa he attendeth here hard by
 to know your answer whether you'll admit him
duke with all my heart some three or four of you
 go give him courteous conduct to this place
 meantime the court shall hear bellario's letter
clerk reads
 your grace shall understand that at the receipt of
 your letter i am very sick but in the instant that
 your messenger came in loving visitation was with
 me a young doctor of rome his name is balthasar i
 acquainted him with the cause in controversy between
 the jew and antonio the merchant we turned o'er
 many books together he is furnished with my
 opinion which bettered with his own learning the
 greatness whereof i cannot enough commend comes
 with him at my importunity to fill up your grace's
 request in my stead i beseech you let his lack of
 years be no impediment to let him lack a reverend
 estimation for i never knew so young a body with so
 old a head i leave him to your gracious
 acceptance whose trial shall better publish his
 commendation
duke you hear the learn'd bellario what he writes
 and here i take it is the doctor come
 enter portia dressed like a doctor of laws
 give me your hand come you from old bellario
portia i did my lord
duke you are welcome take your place
 are you acquainted with the difference
 that holds this present question in the court
portia i am informed thoroughly of the cause
 which is the merchant here and which the jew
duke antonio and old shylock both stand forth
portia is your name shylock
shylock shylock is my name
portia of a strange nature is the suit you follow
 yet in such rule that the venetian law
 cannot impugn you as you do proceed
 you stand within his danger do you not
antonio ay so he says
portia do you confess the bond
antonio i do
portia then must the jew be merciful
shylock on what compulsion must i tell me that
portia the quality of mercy is not strain'd
 it droppeth as the gentle rain from heaven
 upon the place beneath it is twice blest
 it blesseth him that gives and him that takes
 tis mightiest in the mightiest it becomes
 the throned monarch better than his crown
 his sceptre shows the force of temporal power
 the attribute to awe and majesty
 wherein doth sit the dread and fear of kings
 but mercy is above this sceptred sway
 it is enthroned in the hearts of kings
 it is an attribute to god himself
 and earthly power doth then show likest god's
 when mercy seasons justice therefore jew
 though justice be thy plea consider this
 that in the course of justice none of us
 should see salvation we do pray for mercy
 and that same prayer doth teach us all to render
 the deeds of mercy i have spoke thus much
 to mitigate the justice of thy plea
 which if thou follow this strict court of venice
 must needs give sentence gainst the merchant there
shylock my deeds upon my head i crave the law
 the penalty and forfeit of my bond
portia is he not able to discharge the money
bassanio yes here i tender it for him in the court
 yea twice the sum if that will not suffice
 i will be bound to pay it ten times o'er
 on forfeit of my hands my head my heart
 if this will not suffice it must appear
 that malice bears down truth and i beseech you
 wrest once the law to your authority
 to do a great right do a little wrong
 and curb this cruel devil of his will
portia it must not be there is no power in venice
 can alter a decree established
 twill be recorded for a precedent
 and many an error by the same example
 will rush into the state it cannot be
shylock a daniel come to judgment yea a daniel
 o wise young judge how i do honour thee
portia i pray you let me look upon the bond
