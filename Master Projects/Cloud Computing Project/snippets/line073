my heart is inditing a good matter i speak of the things which i have made touching the king my tongue is the pen of a ready writer
thou art fairer than the children of men grace is poured into thy lips therefore god hath blessed thee for ever
gird thy sword upon thy thigh o most mighty with thy glory and thy majesty
and in thy majesty ride prosperously because of truth and meekness and righteousness and thy right hand shall teach thee terrible things
thine arrows are sharp in the heart of the king's enemies whereby the people fall under thee
thy throne o god is for ever and ever the sceptre of thy kingdom is a right sceptre
thou lovest righteousness and hatest wickedness therefore god thy god hath anointed thee with the oil of gladness above thy fellows
all thy garments smell of myrrh and aloes and cassia out of the ivory palaces whereby they have made thee glad
kings daughters were among thy honourable women upon thy right hand did stand the queen in gold of ophir
hearken o daughter and consider and incline thine ear forget also thine own people and thy father's house
so shall the king greatly desire thy beauty for he is thy lord and worship thou him
and the daughter of tyre shall be there with a gift even the rich among the people shall intreat thy favour
the king's daughter is all glorious within her clothing is of wrought gold
she shall be brought unto the king in raiment of needlework the virgins her companions that follow her shall be brought unto thee
with gladness and rejoicing shall they be brought they shall enter into the king's palace
instead of thy fathers shall be thy children whom thou mayest make princes in all the earth
i will make thy name to be remembered in all generations therefore shall the people praise thee for ever and ever
god is our refuge and strength a very present help in trouble
therefore will not we fear though the earth be removed and though the mountains be carried into the midst of the sea
though the waters thereof roar and be troubled though the mountains shake with the swelling thereof selah
there is a river the streams whereof shall make glad the city of god the holy place of the tabernacles of the most high
god is in the midst of her she shall not be moved god shall help her and that right early
the heathen raged the kingdoms were moved he uttered his voice the earth melted
the lord of hosts is with us the god of jacob is our refuge selah
come behold the works of the lord what desolations he hath made in the earth
he maketh wars to cease unto the end of the earth he breaketh the bow and cutteth the spear in sunder he burneth the chariot in the fire
be still and know that i am god i will be exalted among the heathen i will be exalted in the earth
the lord of hosts is with us the god of jacob is our refuge selah
o clap your hands all ye people shout unto god with the voice of triumph
for the lord most high is terrible he is a great king over all the earth
he shall subdue the people under us and the nations under our feet
he shall choose our inheritance for us the excellency of jacob whom he loved selah
god is gone up with a shout the lord with the sound of a trumpet
sing praises to god sing praises sing praises unto our king sing praises
for god is the king of all the earth sing ye praises with understanding
god reigneth over the heathen god sitteth upon the throne of his holiness
the princes of the people are gathered together even the people of the god of abraham for the shields of the earth belong unto god he is greatly exalted
great is the lord and greatly to be praised in the city of our god in the mountain of his holiness
beautiful for situation the joy of the whole earth is mount zion on the sides of the north the city of the great king
god is known in her palaces for a refuge
for lo the kings were assembled they passed by together
they saw it and so they marvelled they were troubled and hasted away
fear took hold upon them there and pain as of a woman in travail
thou breakest the ships of tarshish with an east wind
as we have heard so have we seen in the city of the lord of hosts in the city of our god god will establish it for ever selah
we have thought of thy lovingkindness o god in the midst of thy temple
according to thy name o god so is thy praise unto the ends of the earth thy right hand is full of righteousness
let mount zion rejoice let the daughters of judah be glad because of thy judgments
walk about zion and go round about her tell the towers thereof
mark ye well her bulwarks consider her palaces that ye may tell it to the generation following
for this god is our god for ever and ever he will be our guide even unto death
hear this all ye people give ear all ye inhabitants of the world
both low and high rich and poor together
my mouth shall speak of wisdom and the meditation of my heart shall be of understanding
i will incline mine ear to a parable i will open my dark saying upon the harp
wherefore should i fear in the days of evil when the iniquity of my heels shall compass me about
they that trust in their wealth and boast themselves in the multitude of their riches
none of them can by any means redeem his brother nor give to god a ransom for him
for the redemption of their soul is precious and it ceaseth for ever
that he should still live for ever and not see corruption
for he seeth that wise men die likewise the fool and the brutish person perish and leave their wealth to others
their inward thought is that their houses shall continue for ever and their dwelling places to all generations they call their lands after their own names
nevertheless man being in honour abideth not he is like the beasts that perish
this their way is their folly yet their posterity approve their sayings selah
like sheep they are laid in the grave death shall feed on them and the upright shall have dominion over them in the morning and their beauty shall consume in the grave from their dwelling
but god will redeem my soul from the power of the grave for he shall receive me selah
be not thou afraid when one is made rich when the glory of his house is increased
for when he dieth he shall carry nothing away his glory shall not descend after him
though while he lived he blessed his soul and men will praise thee when thou doest well to thyself
he shall go to the generation of his fathers they shall never see light
man that is in honour and understandeth not is like the beasts that perish
the mighty god even the lord hath spoken and called the earth from the rising of the sun unto the going down thereof
out of zion the perfection of beauty god hath shined
our god shall come and shall not keep silence a fire shall devour before him and it shall be very tempestuous round about him
he shall call to the heavens from above and to the earth that he may judge his people
gather my saints together unto me those that have made a covenant with me by sacrifice
and the heavens shall declare his righteousness for god is judge himself selah
hear o my people and i will speak o israel and i will testify against thee i am god even thy god
i will not reprove thee for thy sacrifices or thy burnt offerings to have been continually before me
i will take no bullock out of thy house nor he goats out of thy folds
for every beast of the forest is mine and the cattle upon a thousand hills
i know all the fowls of the mountains and the wild beasts of the field are mine
if i were hungry i would not tell thee for the world is mine and the fulness thereof
will i eat the flesh of bulls or drink the blood of goats
offer unto god thanksgiving and pay thy vows unto the most high
and call upon me in the day of trouble i will deliver thee and thou shalt glorify me
but unto the wicked god saith what hast thou to do to declare my statutes or that thou shouldest take my covenant in thy mouth
seeing thou hatest instruction and casteth my words behind thee
when thou sawest a thief then thou consentedst with him and hast been partaker with adulterers
thou givest thy mouth to evil and thy tongue frameth deceit
thou sittest and speakest against thy brother thou slanderest thine own mother's son
these things hast thou done and i kept silence thou thoughtest that i was altogether such an one as thyself but i will reprove thee and set them in order before thine eyes
now consider this ye that forget god lest i tear you in pieces and there be none to deliver
whoso offereth praise glorifieth me and to him that ordereth his conversation aright will i shew the salvation of god
have mercy upon me o god according to thy lovingkindness according unto the multitude of thy tender mercies blot out my transgressions
wash me throughly from mine iniquity and cleanse me from my sin
for i acknowledge my transgressions and my sin is ever before me
against thee thee only have i sinned and done this evil in thy sight that thou mightest be justified when thou speakest and be clear when thou judgest
behold i was shapen in iniquity and in sin did my mother conceive me
behold thou desirest truth in the inward parts and in the hidden part thou shalt make me to know wisdom
purge me with hyssop and i shall be clean wash me and i shall be whiter than snow
make me to hear joy and gladness that the bones which thou hast broken may rejoice
hide thy face from my sins and blot out all mine iniquities
create in me a clean heart o god and renew a right spirit within me
cast me not away from thy presence and take not thy holy spirit from me
restore unto me the joy of thy salvation and uphold me with thy free spirit
then will i teach transgressors thy ways and sinners shall be converted unto thee
deliver me from bloodguiltiness o god thou god of my salvation and my tongue shall sing aloud of thy righteousness
o lord open thou my lips and my mouth shall shew forth thy praise
for thou desirest not sacrifice else would i give it thou delightest not in burnt offering
the sacrifices of god are a broken spirit a broken and a contrite heart o god thou wilt not despise
do good in thy good pleasure unto zion build thou the walls of jerusalem
then shalt thou be pleased with the sacrifices of righteousness with burnt offering and whole burnt offering then shall they offer bullocks upon thine altar
why boastest thou thyself in mischief o mighty man the goodness of god endureth continually
thy tongue deviseth mischiefs like a sharp razor working deceitfully
thou lovest evil more than good and lying rather than to speak righteousness selah
thou lovest all devouring words o thou deceitful tongue
god shall likewise destroy thee for ever he shall take thee away and pluck thee out of thy dwelling place and root thee out of the land of the living selah
the righteous also shall see and fear and shall laugh at him
lo this is the man that made not god his strength but trusted in the abundance of his riches and strengthened himself in his wickedness
but i am like a green olive tree in the house of god i trust in the mercy of god for ever and ever
i will praise thee for ever because thou hast done it and i will wait on thy name for it is good before thy saints
the fool hath said in his heart there is no god corrupt are they and have done abominable iniquity there is none that doeth good
god looked down from heaven upon the children of men to see if there were any that did understand that did seek god
every one of them is gone back they are altogether become filthy there is none that doeth good no not one
have the workers of iniquity no knowledge who eat up my people as they eat bread they have not called upon god
there were they in great fear where no fear was for god hath scattered the bones of him that encampeth against thee thou hast put them to shame because god hath despised them
oh that the salvation of israel were come out of zion when god bringeth back the captivity of his people jacob shall rejoice and israel shall be glad
save me o god by thy name and judge me by thy strength
hear my prayer o god give ear to the words of my mouth
for strangers are risen up against me and oppressors seek after my soul they have not set god before them selah
behold god is mine helper the lord is with them that uphold my soul
he shall reward evil unto mine enemies cut them off in thy truth
i will freely sacrifice unto thee i will praise thy name o lord for it is good
for he hath delivered me out of all trouble and mine eye hath seen his desire upon mine enemies
give ear to my prayer o god and hide not thyself from my supplication
attend unto me and hear me i mourn in my complaint and make a noise
because of the voice of the enemy because of the oppression of the wicked for they cast iniquity upon me and in wrath they hate me
my heart is sore pained within me and the terrors of death are fallen upon me
fearfulness and trembling are come upon me and horror hath overwhelmed me
and i said oh that i had wings like a dove for then would i fly away and be at rest
lo then would i wander far off and remain in the wilderness selah
i would hasten my escape from the windy storm and tempest
destroy o lord and divide their tongues for i have seen violence and strife in the city
day and night they go about it upon the walls thereof mischief also and sorrow are in the midst of it
wickedness is in the midst thereof deceit and guile depart not from her streets
for it was not an enemy that reproached me then i could have borne it neither was it he that hated me that did magnify himself against me then i would have hid myself from him
but it was thou a man mine equal my guide and mine acquaintance
we took sweet counsel together and walked unto the house of god in company
let death seize upon them and let them go down quick into hell for wickedness is in their dwellings and among them
as for me i will call upon god and the lord shall save me
evening and morning and at noon will i pray and cry aloud and he shall hear my voice
he hath delivered my soul in peace from the battle that was against me for there were many with me
god shall hear and afflict them even he that abideth of old selah because they have no changes therefore they fear not god
he hath put forth his hands against such as be at peace with him he hath broken his covenant
the words of his mouth were smoother than butter but war was in his heart his words were softer than oil yet were they drawn swords
cast thy burden upon the lord and he shall sustain thee he shall never suffer the righteous to be moved
but thou o god shalt bring them down into the pit of destruction bloody and deceitful men shall not live out half their days but i will trust in thee
be merciful unto me o god for man would swallow me up he fighting daily oppresseth me
mine enemies would daily swallow me up for they be many that fight against me o thou most high
what time i am afraid i will trust in thee
in god i will praise his word in god i have put my trust i will not fear what flesh can do unto me
every day they wrest my words all their thoughts are against me for evil
they gather themselves together they hide themselves they mark my steps when they wait for my soul
shall they escape by iniquity in thine anger cast down the people o god
thou tellest my wanderings put thou my tears into thy bottle are they not in thy book
when i cry unto thee then shall mine enemies turn back this i know for god is for me
in god will i praise his word in the lord will i praise his word
in god have i put my trust i will not be afraid what man can do unto me
thy vows are upon me o god i will render praises unto thee
for thou hast delivered my soul from death wilt not thou deliver my feet from falling that i may walk before god in the light of the living
be merciful unto me o god be merciful unto me for my soul trusteth in thee yea in the shadow of thy wings will i make my refuge until these calamities be overpast
i will cry unto god most high unto god that performeth all things for me
he shall send from heaven and save me from the reproach of him that would swallow me up selah god shall send forth his mercy and his truth
my soul is among lions and i lie even among them that are set on fire even the sons of men whose teeth are spears and arrows and their tongue a sharp sword
be thou exalted o god above the heavens let thy glory be above all the earth
they have prepared a net for my steps my soul is bowed down they have digged a pit before me into the midst whereof they are fallen themselves selah
my heart is fixed o god my heart is fixed i will sing and give praise
awake up my glory awake psaltery and harp i myself will awake early
i will praise thee o lord among the people i will sing unto thee among the nations
for thy mercy is great unto the heavens and thy truth unto the clouds
be thou exalted o god above the heavens let thy glory be above all the earth
do ye indeed speak righteousness o congregation do ye judge uprightly o ye sons of men
yea in heart ye work wickedness ye weigh the violence of your hands in the earth
the wicked are estranged from the womb they go astray as soon as they be born speaking lies
their poison is like the poison of a serpent they are like the deaf adder that stoppeth her ear
which will not hearken to the voice of charmers charming never so wisely
break their teeth o god in their mouth break out the great teeth of the young lions o lord
let them melt away as waters which run continually when he bendeth his bow to shoot his arrows let them be as cut in pieces
as a snail which melteth let every one of them pass away like the untimely birth of a woman that they may not see the sun
before your pots can feel the thorns he shall take them away as with a whirlwind both living and in his wrath
the righteous shall rejoice when he seeth the vengeance he shall wash his feet in the blood of the wicked
so that a man shall say verily there is a reward for the righteous verily he is a god that judgeth in the earth
deliver me from mine enemies o my god defend me from them that rise up against me
deliver me from the workers of iniquity and save me from bloody men
for lo they lie in wait for my soul the mighty are gathered against me not for my transgression nor for my sin o lord
they run and prepare themselves without my fault awake to help me and behold
thou therefore o lord god of hosts the god of israel awake to visit all the heathen be not merciful to any wicked transgressors selah
they return at evening they make a noise like a dog and go round about the city
behold they belch out with their mouth swords are in their lips for who say they doth hear
