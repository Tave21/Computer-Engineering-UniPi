 banquo and donalbain malcolm awake
 shake off this downy sleep death's counterfeit
 and look on death itself up up and see
 the great doom's image malcolm banquo
 as from your graves rise up and walk like sprites
 to countenance this horror ring the bell
 bell rings
 enter lady macbeth
lady macbeth what's the business
 that such a hideous trumpet calls to parley
 the sleepers of the house speak speak
macduff o gentle lady
 tis not for you to hear what i can speak
 the repetition in a woman's ear
 would murder as it fell
 enter banquo
 o banquo banquo
 our royal master s murder'd
lady macbeth woe alas
 what in our house
banquo too cruel any where
 dear duff i prithee contradict thyself
 and say it is not so
 reenter macbeth and lennox with ross
macbeth had i but died an hour before this chance
 i had lived a blessed time for from this instant
 there s nothing serious in mortality
 all is but toys renown and grace is dead
 the wine of life is drawn and the mere lees
 is left this vault to brag of
 enter malcolm and donalbain
donalbain what is amiss
macbeth you are and do not know't
 the spring the head the fountain of your blood
 is stopp'd the very source of it is stopp'd
macduff your royal father s murder'd
malcolm o by whom
lennox those of his chamber as it seem'd had done t
 their hands and faces were an badged with blood
 so were their daggers which unwiped we found
 upon their pillows
 they stared and were distracted no man's life
 was to be trusted with them
macbeth o yet i do repent me of my fury
 that i did kill them
macduff wherefore did you so
macbeth who can be wise amazed temperate and furious
 loyal and neutral in a moment no man
 the expedition my violent love
 outrun the pauser reason here lay duncan
 his silver skin laced with his golden blood
 and his gash'd stabs look'd like a breach in nature
 for ruin's wasteful entrance there the murderers
 steep'd in the colours of their trade their daggers
 unmannerly breech'd with gore who could refrain
 that had a heart to love and in that heart
 courage to make s love known
lady macbeth help me hence ho
macduff look to the lady
malcolm aside to donalbain why do we hold our tongues
 that most may claim this argument for ours
donalbain aside to malcolm what should be spoken here
 where our fate
 hid in an augerhole may rush and seize us
 let s away
 our tears are not yet brew'd
malcolm aside to donalbain nor our strong sorrow
 upon the foot of motion
banquo look to the lady
 lady macbeth is carried out
 and when we have our naked frailties hid
 that suffer in exposure let us meet
 and question this most bloody piece of work
 to know it further fears and scruples shake us
 in the great hand of god i stand and thence
 against the undivulged pretence i fight
 of treasonous malice
macduff and so do i
all so all
macbeth let's briefly put on manly readiness
 and meet i the hall together
all well contented
 exeunt all but malcolm and donalbain
malcolm what will you do let's not consort with them
 to show an unfelt sorrow is an office
 which the false man does easy i'll to england
donalbain to ireland i our separated fortune
 shall keep us both the safer where we are
 there's daggers in men's smiles the near in blood
 the nearer bloody
malcolm this murderous shaft that's shot
 hath not yet lighted and our safest way
 is to avoid the aim therefore to horse
 and let us not be dainty of leavetaking
 but shift away there's warrant in that theft
 which steals itself when there's no mercy left

act ii
scene iv outside macbeth's castle
 enter ross and an old man
old man threescore and ten i can remember well
 within the volume of which time i have seen
 hours dreadful and things strange but this sore night
 hath trifled former knowings
ross ah good father
 thou seest the heavens as troubled with man's act
 threaten his bloody stage by the clock tis day
 and yet dark night strangles the travelling lamp
 is't night's predominance or the day's shame
 that darkness does the face of earth entomb
 when living light should kiss it
old man tis unnatural
 even like the deed that's done on tuesday last
 a falcon towering in her pride of place
 was by a mousing owl hawk'd at and kill'd
ross and duncan's horsesa thing most strange and certain
 beauteous and swift the minions of their race
 turn'd wild in nature broke their stalls flung out
 contending gainst obedience as they would make
 war with mankind
old man tis said they eat each other
ross they did so to the amazement of mine eyes
 that look'd upon't here comes the good macduff
 enter macduff
 how goes the world sir now
macduff why see you not
ross is't known who did this more than bloody deed
macduff those that macbeth hath slain
ross alas the day
 what good could they pretend
macduff they were suborn'd
 malcolm and donalbain the king's two sons
 are stol'n away and fled which puts upon them
 suspicion of the deed
ross gainst nature still
 thriftless ambition that wilt ravin up
 thine own life's means then tis most like
 the sovereignty will fall upon macbeth
macduff he is already named and gone to scone
 to be invested
ross where is duncan's body
macduff carried to colmekill
 the sacred storehouse of his predecessors
 and guardian of their bones
ross will you to scone
macduff no cousin i'll to fife
ross well i will thither
macduff well may you see things well done there adieu
 lest our old robes sit easier than our new
ross farewell father
old man god's benison go with you and with those
 that would make good of bad and friends of foes
 exeunt
 macbeth
act iii
scene i forres the palace
 enter banquo
banquo thou hast it now king cawdor glamis all
 as the weird women promised and i fear
 thou play'dst most foully for't yet it was said
 it should not stand in thy posterity
 but that myself should be the root and father
 of many kings if there come truth from them
 as upon thee macbeth their speeches shine
 why by the verities on thee made good
 may they not be my oracles as well
 and set me up in hope but hush no more
 sennet sounded enter macbeth as king lady
 macbeth as queen lennox ross lords ladies and
 attendants
macbeth here's our chief guest
lady macbeth if he had been forgotten
 it had been as a gap in our great feast
 and allthing unbecoming
macbeth tonight we hold a solemn supper sir
 and i'll request your presence
banquo let your highness
 command upon me to the which my duties
 are with a most indissoluble tie
 for ever knit
macbeth ride you this afternoon
banquo ay my good lord
macbeth we should have else desired your good advice
 which still hath been both grave and prosperous
 in this day's council but we'll take tomorrow
 is't far you ride
banquo as far my lord as will fill up the time
 twixt this and supper go not my horse the better
 i must become a borrower of the night
 for a dark hour or twain
macbeth fail not our feast
banquo my lord i will not
macbeth we hear our bloody cousins are bestow'd
 in england and in ireland not confessing
 their cruel parricide filling their hearers
 with strange invention but of that tomorrow
 when therewithal we shall have cause of state
 craving us jointly hie you to horse adieu
 till you return at night goes fleance with you
