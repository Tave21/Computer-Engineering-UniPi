 o let me have no subject enemies
 when adverse foreigners affright my towns
 with dreadful pomp of stout invasion
 be mercury set feathers to thy heels
 and fly like thought from them to me again
bastard the spirit of the time shall teach me speed
 exit
king john spoke like a sprightful noble gentleman
 go after him for he perhaps shall need
 some messenger betwixt me and the peers
 and be thou he
messenger with all my heart my liege
 exit
king john my mother dead
 reenter hubert
hubert my lord they say five moons were seen tonight
 four fixed and the fifth did whirl about
 the other four in wondrous motion
king john five moons
hubert old men and beldams in the streets
 do prophesy upon it dangerously
 young arthur's death is common in their mouths
 and when they talk of him they shake their heads
 and whisper one another in the ear
 and he that speaks doth gripe the hearer's wrist
 whilst he that hears makes fearful action
 with wrinkled brows with nods with rolling eyes
 i saw a smith stand with his hammer thus
 the whilst his iron did on the anvil cool
 with open mouth swallowing a tailor's news
 who with his shears and measure in his hand
 standing on slippers which his nimble haste
 had falsely thrust upon contrary feet
 told of a many thousand warlike french
 that were embattailed and rank'd in kent
 another lean unwash'd artificer
 cuts off his tale and talks of arthur's death
king john why seek'st thou to possess me with these fears
 why urgest thou so oft young arthur's death
 thy hand hath murder'd him i had a mighty cause
 to wish him dead but thou hadst none to kill him
hubert no had my lord why did you not provoke me
king john it is the curse of kings to be attended
 by slaves that take their humours for a warrant
 to break within the bloody house of life
 and on the winking of authority
 to understand a law to know the meaning
 of dangerous majesty when perchance it frowns
 more upon humour than advised respect
hubert here is your hand and seal for what i did
king john o when the last account twixt heaven and earth
 is to be made then shall this hand and seal
 witness against us to damnation
 how oft the sight of means to do ill deeds
 make deeds ill done hadst not thou been by
 a fellow by the hand of nature mark'd
 quoted and sign'd to do a deed of shame
 this murder had not come into my mind
 but taking note of thy abhorr'd aspect
 finding thee fit for bloody villany
 apt liable to be employ'd in danger
 i faintly broke with thee of arthur's death
 and thou to be endeared to a king
 made it no conscience to destroy a prince
hubert my lord
king john hadst thou but shook thy head or made a pause
 when i spake darkly what i purposed
 or turn'd an eye of doubt upon my face
 as bid me tell my tale in express words
 deep shame had struck me dumb made me break off
 and those thy fears might have wrought fears in me
 but thou didst understand me by my signs
 and didst in signs again parley with sin
 yea without stop didst let thy heart consent
 and consequently thy rude hand to act
 the deed which both our tongues held vile to name
 out of my sight and never see me more
 my nobles leave me and my state is braved
 even at my gates with ranks of foreign powers
 nay in the body of this fleshly land
 this kingdom this confine of blood and breath
 hostility and civil tumult reigns
 between my conscience and my cousin's death
hubert arm you against your other enemies
 i'll make a peace between your soul and you
 young arthur is alive this hand of mine
 is yet a maiden and an innocent hand
 not painted with the crimson spots of blood
 within this bosom never enter'd yet
 the dreadful motion of a murderous thought
 and you have slander'd nature in my form
 which howsoever rude exteriorly
 is yet the cover of a fairer mind
 than to be butcher of an innocent child
king john doth arthur live o haste thee to the peers
 throw this report on their incensed rage
 and make them tame to their obedience
 forgive the comment that my passion made
 upon thy feature for my rage was blind
 and foul imaginary eyes of blood
 presented thee more hideous than thou art
 o answer not but to my closet bring
 the angry lords with all expedient haste
 i conjure thee but slowly run more fast
 exeunt
 king john
act iv
scene iii before the castle
 enter arthur on the walls
arthur the wall is high and yet will i leap down
 good ground be pitiful and hurt me not
 there's few or none do know me if they did
 this shipboy's semblance hath disguised me quite
 i am afraid and yet i'll venture it
 if i get down and do not break my limbs
 i'll find a thousand shifts to get away
 as good to die and go as die and stay
 leaps down
 o me my uncle's spirit is in these stones
 heaven take my soul and england keep my bones
 dies
 enter pembroke salisbury and bigot
salisbury lords i will meet him at saint edmundsbury
 it is our safety and we must embrace
 this gentle offer of the perilous time
pembroke who brought that letter from the cardinal
salisbury the count melun a noble lord of france
 whose private with me of the dauphin's love
 is much more general than these lines import
bigot tomorrow morning let us meet him then
salisbury or rather then set forward for twill be
 two long days journey lords or ere we meet
 enter the bastard
bastard once more today well met distemper'd lords
 the king by me requests your presence straight
salisbury the king hath dispossess'd himself of us
 we will not line his thin bestained cloak
 with our pure honours nor attend the foot
 that leaves the print of blood where'er it walks
 return and tell him so we know the worst
bastard whate'er you think good words i think were best
salisbury our griefs and not our manners reason now
bastard but there is little reason in your grief
 therefore twere reason you had manners now
pembroke sir sir impatience hath his privilege
bastard tis true to hurt his master no man else
salisbury this is the prison what is he lies here
 seeing arthur
pembroke o death made proud with pure and princely beauty
 the earth had not a hole to hide this deed
salisbury murder as hating what himself hath done
 doth lay it open to urge on revenge
bigot or when he doom'd this beauty to a grave
 found it too preciousprincely for a grave
salisbury sir richard what think you have you beheld
 or have you read or heard or could you think
 or do you almost think although you see
 that you do see could thought without this object
 form such another this is the very top
 the height the crest or crest unto the crest
 of murder's arms this is the bloodiest shame
 the wildest savagery the vilest stroke
 that ever walleyed wrath or staring rage
 presented to the tears of soft remorse
pembroke all murders past do stand excused in this
 and this so sole and so unmatchable
 shall give a holiness a purity
 to the yet unbegotten sin of times
 and prove a deadly bloodshed but a jest
 exampled by this heinous spectacle
bastard it is a damned and a bloody work
 the graceless action of a heavy hand
 if that it be the work of any hand
salisbury if that it be the work of any hand
 we had a kind of light what would ensue
 it is the shameful work of hubert's hand
 the practise and the purpose of the king
 from whose obedience i forbid my soul
 kneeling before this ruin of sweet life
 and breathing to his breathless excellence
 the incense of a vow a holy vow
 never to taste the pleasures of the world
 never to be infected with delight
 nor conversant with ease and idleness
 till i have set a glory to this hand
 by giving it the worship of revenge
pembroke 
 our souls religiously confirm thy words
bigot 
 enter hubert
hubert lords i am hot with haste in seeking you
 arthur doth live the king hath sent for you
salisbury o he is old and blushes not at death
 avaunt thou hateful villain get thee gone
hubert i am no villain
salisbury must i rob the law
 drawing his sword
bastard your sword is bright sir put it up again
salisbury not till i sheathe it in a murderer's skin
hubert stand back lord salisbury stand back i say
