scene i the rebel camp near shrewsbury
 enter hotspur worcester and douglas
hotspur well said my noble scot if speaking truth
 in this fine age were not thought flattery
 such attribution should the douglas have
 as not a soldier of this season's stamp
 should go so general current through the world
 by god i cannot flatter i do defy
 the tongues of soothers but a braver place
 in my heart's love hath no man than yourself
 nay task me to my word approve me lord
earl of douglas thou art the king of honour
 no man so potent breathes upon the ground
 but i will beard him
hotspur do so and tis well
 enter a messenger with letters
 what letters hast thou therei can but thank you
messenger these letters come from your father
hotspur letters from him why comes he not himself
messenger he cannot come my lord he is grievous sick
hotspur zounds how has he the leisure to be sick
 in such a rustling time who leads his power
 under whose government come they along
messenger his letters bear his mind not i my lord
earl of worcester i prithee tell me doth he keep his bed
messenger he did my lord four days ere i set forth
 and at the time of my departure thence
 he was much fear'd by his physicians
earl of worcester i would the state of time had first been whole
 ere he by sickness had been visited
 his health was never better worth than now
hotspur sick now droop now this sickness doth infect
 the very lifeblood of our enterprise
 tis catching hither even to our camp
 he writes me here that inward sickness
 and that his friends by deputation could not
 so soon be drawn nor did he think it meet
 to lay so dangerous and dear a trust
 on any soul removed but on his own
 yet doth he give us bold advertisement
 that with our small conjunction we should on
 to see how fortune is disposed to us
 for as he writes there is no quailing now
 because the king is certainly possess'd
 of all our purposes what say you to it
earl of worcester your father's sickness is a maim to us
hotspur a perilous gash a very limb lopp'd off
 and yet in faith it is not his present want
 seems more than we shall find it were it good
 to set the exact wealth of all our states
 all at one cast to set so rich a main
 on the nice hazard of one doubtful hour
 it were not good for therein should we read
 the very bottom and the soul of hope
 the very list the very utmost bound
 of all our fortunes
earl of douglas faith and so we should
 where now remains a sweet reversion
 we may boldly spend upon the hope of what
 is to come in
 a comfort of retirement lives in this
hotspur a rendezvous a home to fly unto
 if that the devil and mischance look big
 upon the maidenhead of our affairs
earl of worcester but yet i would your father had been here
 the quality and hair of our attempt
 brooks no division it will be thought
 by some that know not why he is away
 that wisdom loyalty and mere dislike
 of our proceedings kept the earl from hence
 and think how such an apprehension
 may turn the tide of fearful faction
 and breed a kind of question in our cause
 for well you know we of the offering side
 must keep aloof from strict arbitrement
 and stop all sightholes every loop from whence
 the eye of reason may pry in upon us
 this absence of your father's draws a curtain
 that shows the ignorant a kind of fear
 before not dreamt of
hotspur you strain too far
 i rather of his absence make this use
 it lends a lustre and more great opinion
 a larger dare to our great enterprise
 than if the earl were here for men must think
 if we without his help can make a head
 to push against a kingdom with his help
 we shall o'erturn it topsyturvy down
 yet all goes well yet all our joints are whole
earl of douglas as heart can think there is not such a word
 spoke of in scotland as this term of fear
 enter sir richard vernon
hotspur my cousin vernon welcome by my soul
vernon pray god my news be worth a welcome lord
 the earl of westmoreland seven thousand strong
 is marching hitherwards with him prince john
hotspur no harm what more
vernon and further i have learn'd
 the king himself in person is set forth
 or hitherwards intended speedily
 with strong and mighty preparation
hotspur he shall be welcome too where is his son
 the nimblefooted madcap prince of wales
 and his comrades that daff'd the world aside
 and bid it pass
vernon all furnish'd all in arms
 all plumed like estridges that with the wind
 baited like eagles having lately bathed
 glittering in golden coats like images
 as full of spirit as the month of may
 and gorgeous as the sun at midsummer
 wanton as youthful goats wild as young bulls
 i saw young harry with his beaver on
 his cuisses on his thighs gallantly arm'd
 rise from the ground like feather'd mercury
 and vaulted with such ease into his seat
 as if an angel dropp'd down from the clouds
 to turn and wind a fiery pegasus
 and witch the world with noble horsemanship
hotspur no more no more worse than the sun in march
 this praise doth nourish agues let them come
 they come like sacrifices in their trim
 and to the fireeyed maid of smoky war
 all hot and bleeding will we offer them
 the mailed mars shall on his altar sit
 up to the ears in blood i am on fire
 to hear this rich reprisal is so nigh
 and yet not ours come let me taste my horse
 who is to bear me like a thunderbolt
 against the bosom of the prince of wales
 harry to harry shall hot horse to horse
 meet and ne'er part till one drop down a corse
 o that glendower were come
vernon there is more news
 i learn'd in worcester as i rode along
 he cannot draw his power this fourteen days
earl of douglas that's the worst tidings that i hear of yet
worcester ay by my faith that bears a frosty sound
hotspur what may the king's whole battle reach unto
vernon to thirty thousand
hotspur forty let it be
 my father and glendower being both away
 the powers of us may serve so great a day
 come let us take a muster speedily
 doomsday is near die all die merrily
earl of douglas talk not of dying i am out of fear
 of death or death's hand for this onehalf year

scene ii a public road near coventry

bardolph i will captain farewell
 exit
falstaff if i be not ashamed of my soldiers i am a soused
 gurnet i have misused the king's press damnably
 i have got in exchange of a hundred and fifty
 soldiers three hundred and odd pounds i press me
 none but good householders yeoman's sons inquire
 me out contracted bachelors such as had been asked
 twice on the banns such a commodity of warm slaves
 as had as lieve hear the devil as a drum such as
 fear the report of a caliver worse than a struck
 fowl or a hurt wildduck i pressed me none but such
 toastsandbutter with hearts in their bellies no
 bigger than pins heads and they have bought out
 their services and now my whole charge consists of
 ancients corporals lieutenants gentlemen of
 companies slaves as ragged as lazarus in the
 painted cloth where the glutton's dogs licked his
 sores and such as indeed were never soldiers but
 discarded unjust servingmen younger sons to
 younger brothers revolted tapsters and ostlers
 tradefallen the cankers of a calm world and a
 long peace ten times more dishonourable ragged than
 an old faced ancient and such have i to fill up
 the rooms of them that have bought out their
 services that you would think that i had a hundred
 and fifty tattered prodigals lately come from
 swinekeeping from eating draff and husks a mad
 fellow met me on the way and told me i had unloaded
 all the gibbets and pressed the dead bodies no eye
