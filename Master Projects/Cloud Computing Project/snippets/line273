iago touch me not so near
 i had rather have this tongue cut from my mouth
 than it should do offence to michael cassio
 yet i persuade myself to speak the truth
 shall nothing wrong him thus it is general
 montano and myself being in speech
 there comes a fellow crying out for help
 and cassio following him with determined sword
 to execute upon him sir this gentleman
 steps in to cassio and entreats his pause
 myself the crying fellow did pursue
 lest by his clamouras it so fell out
 the town might fall in fright he swift of foot
 outran my purpose and i return'd the rather
 for that i heard the clink and fall of swords
 and cassio high in oath which till tonight
 i ne'er might say before when i came back
 for this was briefi found them close together
 at blow and thrust even as again they were
 when you yourself did part them
 more of this matter cannot i report
 but men are men the best sometimes forget
 though cassio did some little wrong to him
 as men in rage strike those that wish them best
 yet surely cassio i believe received
 from him that fled some strange indignity
 which patience could not pass
othello i know iago
 thy honesty and love doth mince this matter
 making it light to cassio cassio i love thee
 but never more be officer of mine
 reenter desdemona attended
 look if my gentle love be not raised up
 i'll make thee an example
desdemona what's the matter
othello all's well now sweeting come away to bed
 sir for your hurts myself will be your surgeon
 lead him off
 to montano who is led off
 iago look with care about the town
 and silence those whom this vile brawl distracted
 come desdemona tis the soldiers life
 to have their balmy slumbers waked with strife
 exeunt all but iago and cassio
iago what are you hurt lieutenant
cassio ay past all surgery
iago marry heaven forbid
cassio reputation reputation reputation o i have lost
 my reputation i have lost the immortal part of
 myself and what remains is bestial my reputation
 iago my reputation
iago as i am an honest man i thought you had received
 some bodily wound there is more sense in that than
 in reputation reputation is an idle and most false
 imposition oft got without merit and lost without
 deserving you have lost no reputation at all
 unless you repute yourself such a loser what man
 there are ways to recover the general again you
 are but now cast in his mood a punishment more in
 policy than in malice even so as one would beat his
 offenceless dog to affright an imperious lion sue
 to him again and he's yours
cassio i will rather sue to be despised than to deceive so
 good a commander with so slight so drunken and so
 indiscreet an officer drunk and speak parrot
 and squabble swagger swear and discourse
 fustian with one's own shadow o thou invisible
 spirit of wine if thou hast no name to be known by
 let us call thee devil
iago what was he that you followed with your sword what
 had he done to you
cassio i know not
iago is't possible
cassio i remember a mass of things but nothing distinctly
 a quarrel but nothing wherefore o god that men
 should put an enemy in their mouths to steal away
 their brains that we should with joy pleasance
 revel and applause transform ourselves into beasts
iago why but you are now well enough how came you thus
 recovered
cassio it hath pleased the devil drunkenness to give place
 to the devil wrath one unperfectness shows me
 another to make me frankly despise myself
iago come you are too severe a moraler as the time
 the place and the condition of this country
 stands i could heartily wish this had not befallen
 but since it is as it is mend it for your own good
cassio i will ask him for my place again he shall tell me
 i am a drunkard had i as many mouths as hydra
 such an answer would stop them all to be now a
 sensible man by and by a fool and presently a
 beast o strange every inordinate cup is
 unblessed and the ingredient is a devil
iago come come good wine is a good familiar creature
 if it be well used exclaim no more against it
 and good lieutenant i think you think i love you
cassio i have well approved it sir i drunk
iago you or any man living may be drunk at a time man
 i'll tell you what you shall do our general's wife
 is now the general may say so in this respect for
 that he hath devoted and given up himself to the
 contemplation mark and denotement of her parts and
 graces confess yourself freely to her importune
 her help to put you in your place again she is of
 so free so kind so apt so blessed a disposition
 she holds it a vice in her goodness not to do more
 than she is requested this broken joint between
 you and her husband entreat her to splinter and my
 fortunes against any lay worth naming this
 crack of your love shall grow stronger than it was before
cassio you advise me well
iago i protest in the sincerity of love and honest kindness
cassio i think it freely and betimes in the morning i will
 beseech the virtuous desdemona to undertake for me
 i am desperate of my fortunes if they cheque me here
iago you are in the right good night lieutenant i
 must to the watch
cassio good night honest iago
 exit
iago and what's he then that says i play the villain
 when this advice is free i give and honest
 probal to thinking and indeed the course
 to win the moor again for tis most easy
 the inclining desdemona to subdue
 in any honest suit she's framed as fruitful
 as the free elements and then for her
 to win the moorwere't to renounce his baptism
 all seals and symbols of redeemed sin
 his soul is so enfetter'd to her love
 that she may make unmake do what she list
 even as her appetite shall play the god
 with his weak function how am i then a villain
 to counsel cassio to this parallel course
 directly to his good divinity of hell
 when devils will the blackest sins put on
 they do suggest at first with heavenly shows
 as i do now for whiles this honest fool
 plies desdemona to repair his fortunes
 and she for him pleads strongly to the moor
 i'll pour this pestilence into his ear
 that she repeals him for her body's lust
 and by how much she strives to do him good
 she shall undo her credit with the moor
 so will i turn her virtue into pitch
 and out of her own goodness make the net
 that shall enmesh them all
 reenter roderigo
 how now roderigo
roderigo i do follow here in the chase not like a hound that
 hunts but one that fills up the cry my money is
 almost spent i have been tonight exceedingly well
 cudgelled and i think the issue will be i shall
 have so much experience for my pains and so with
 no money at all and a little more wit return again to venice
iago how poor are they that have not patience
 what wound did ever heal but by degrees
 thou know'st we work by wit and not by witchcraft
 and wit depends on dilatory time
 does't not go well cassio hath beaten thee
 and thou by that small hurt hast cashier'd cassio
 though other things grow fair against the sun
 yet fruits that blossom first will first be ripe
 content thyself awhile by the mass tis morning
 pleasure and action make the hours seem short
 retire thee go where thou art billeted
 away i say thou shalt know more hereafter
 nay get thee gone
 exit roderigo
 two things are to be done
 my wife must move for cassio to her mistress
 i'll set her on
 myself the while to draw the moor apart
 and bring him jump when he may cassio find
 soliciting his wife ay that's the way
 dull not device by coldness and delay
 exit
