 that pierced the fearful hollow of thine ear
 nightly she sings on yon pomegranatetree
 believe me love it was the nightingale
romeo it was the lark the herald of the morn
 no nightingale look love what envious streaks
 do lace the severing clouds in yonder east
 night's candles are burnt out and jocund day
 stands tiptoe on the misty mountain tops
 i must be gone and live or stay and die
juliet yon light is not daylight i know it i
 it is some meteor that the sun exhales
 to be to thee this night a torchbearer
 and light thee on thy way to mantua
 therefore stay yet thou need'st not to be gone
romeo let me be ta'en let me be put to death
 i am content so thou wilt have it so
 i'll say yon grey is not the morning's eye
 tis but the pale reflex of cynthia's brow
 nor that is not the lark whose notes do beat
 the vaulty heaven so high above our heads
 i have more care to stay than will to go
 come death and welcome juliet wills it so
 how is't my soul let's talk it is not day
juliet it is it is hie hence be gone away
 it is the lark that sings so out of tune
 straining harsh discords and unpleasing sharps
 some say the lark makes sweet division
 this doth not so for she divideth us
 some say the lark and loathed toad change eyes
 o now i would they had changed voices too
 since arm from arm that voice doth us affray
 hunting thee hence with hunt'sup to the day
 o now be gone more light and light it grows
romeo more light and light more dark and dark our woes
 enter nurse to the chamber
nurse madam
juliet nurse
nurse your lady mother is coming to your chamber
 the day is broke be wary look about
 exit
juliet then window let day in and let life out
romeo farewell farewell one kiss and i'll descend
 he goeth down
juliet art thou gone so love lord ay husband friend
 i must hear from thee every day in the hour
 for in a minute there are many days
 o by this count i shall be much in years
 ere i again behold my romeo
romeo farewell
 i will omit no opportunity
 that may convey my greetings love to thee
juliet o think'st thou we shall ever meet again
romeo i doubt it not and all these woes shall serve
 for sweet discourses in our time to come
juliet o god i have an illdivining soul
 methinks i see thee now thou art below
 as one dead in the bottom of a tomb
 either my eyesight fails or thou look'st pale
romeo and trust me love in my eye so do you
 dry sorrow drinks our blood adieu adieu
 exit
juliet o fortune fortune all men call thee fickle
 if thou art fickle what dost thou with him
 that is renown'd for faith be fickle fortune
 for then i hope thou wilt not keep him long
 but send him back
lady capulet within ho daughter are you up
juliet who is't that calls is it my lady mother
 is she not down so late or up so early
 what unaccustom'd cause procures her hither
 enter lady capulet
lady capulet why how now juliet
juliet madam i am not well
lady capulet evermore weeping for your cousin's death
 what wilt thou wash him from his grave with tears
 an if thou couldst thou couldst not make him live
 therefore have done some grief shows much of love
 but much of grief shows still some want of wit
juliet yet let me weep for such a feeling loss
lady capulet so shall you feel the loss but not the friend
 which you weep for
juliet feeling so the loss
 cannot choose but ever weep the friend
lady capulet well girl thou weep'st not so much for his death
 as that the villain lives which slaughter'd him
juliet what villain madam
lady capulet that same villain romeo
juliet aside villain and he be many miles asunder
 god pardon him i do with all my heart
 and yet no man like he doth grieve my heart
lady capulet that is because the traitor murderer lives
juliet ay madam from the reach of these my hands
 would none but i might venge my cousin's death
lady capulet we will have vengeance for it fear thou not
 then weep no more i'll send to one in mantua
 where that same banish'd runagate doth live
 shall give him such an unaccustom'd dram
 that he shall soon keep tybalt company
 and then i hope thou wilt be satisfied
juliet indeed i never shall be satisfied
 with romeo till i behold himdead
 is my poor heart for a kinsman vex'd
 madam if you could find out but a man
 to bear a poison i would temper it
 that romeo should upon receipt thereof
 soon sleep in quiet o how my heart abhors
 to hear him named and cannot come to him
 to wreak the love i bore my cousin
 upon his body that slaughter'd him
lady capulet find thou the means and i'll find such a man
 but now i'll tell thee joyful tidings girl
juliet and joy comes well in such a needy time
 what are they i beseech your ladyship
lady capulet well well thou hast a careful father child
 one who to put thee from thy heaviness
 hath sorted out a sudden day of joy
 that thou expect'st not nor i look'd not for
juliet madam in happy time what day is that
lady capulet marry my child early next thursday morn
 the gallant young and noble gentleman
 the county paris at saint peter's church
 shall happily make thee there a joyful bride
juliet now by saint peter's church and peter too
 he shall not make me there a joyful bride
 i wonder at this haste that i must wed
 ere he that should be husband comes to woo
 i pray you tell my lord and father madam
 i will not marry yet and when i do i swear
 it shall be romeo whom you know i hate
 rather than paris these are news indeed
lady capulet here comes your father tell him so yourself
 and see how he will take it at your hands
 enter capulet and nurse
capulet when the sun sets the air doth drizzle dew
 but for the sunset of my brother's son
 it rains downright
 how now a conduit girl what still in tears
 evermore showering in one little body
 thou counterfeit'st a bark a sea a wind
 for still thy eyes which i may call the sea
 do ebb and flow with tears the bark thy body is
 sailing in this salt flood the winds thy sighs
 who raging with thy tears and they with them
 without a sudden calm will overset
 thy tempesttossed body how now wife
 have you deliver'd to her our decree
lady capulet ay sir but she will none she gives you thanks
 i would the fool were married to her grave
capulet soft take me with you take me with you wife
 how will she none doth she not give us thanks
 is she not proud doth she not count her blest
 unworthy as she is that we have wrought
 so worthy a gentleman to be her bridegroom
juliet not proud you have but thankful that you have
 proud can i never be of what i hate
 but thankful even for hate that is meant love
capulet how now how now choplogic what is this
 proud and i thank you and i thank you not'
 and yet not proud mistress minion you
 thank me no thankings nor proud me no prouds
 but fettle your fine joints gainst thursday next
 to go with paris to saint peter's church
 or i will drag thee on a hurdle thither
 out you greensickness carrion out you baggage
 you tallowface
lady capulet fie fie what are you mad
juliet good father i beseech you on my knees
 hear me with patience but to speak a word
capulet hang thee young baggage disobedient wretch
 i tell thee what get thee to church o thursday
 or never after look me in the face
 speak not reply not do not answer me
 my fingers itch wife we scarce thought us blest
 that god had lent us but this only child
 but now i see this one is one too much
 and that we have a curse in having her
 out on her hilding
nurse god in heaven bless her
 you are to blame my lord to rate her so
capulet and why my lady wisdom hold your tongue
 good prudence smatter with your gossips go
nurse i speak no treason
capulet o god ye godden
nurse may not one speak
capulet peace you mumbling fool
 utter your gravity o'er a gossip's bowl
 for here we need it not
lady capulet you are too hot
capulet god's bread it makes me mad
 day night hour tide time work play
 alone in company still my care hath been
 to have her match'd and having now provided
 a gentleman of noble parentage
 of fair demesnes youthful and nobly train'd
 stuff'd as they say with honourable parts
 proportion'd as one's thought would wish a man
 and then to have a wretched puling fool
 a whining mammet in her fortune's tender
 to answer i'll not wed i cannot love
 i am too young i pray you pardon me'
