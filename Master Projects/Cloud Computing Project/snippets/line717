act ii
scene i westminster a street
 enter two gentlemen meeting
first gentleman whither away so fast
second gentleman o god save ye
 even to the hall to hear what shall become
 of the great duke of buckingham
first gentleman i'll save you
 that labour sir all's now done but the ceremony
 of bringing back the prisoner
second gentleman were you there
first gentleman yes indeed was i
second gentleman pray speak what has happen'd
first gentleman you may guess quickly what
second gentleman is he found guilty
first gentleman yes truly is he and condemn'd upon't
second gentleman i am sorry for't
first gentleman so are a number more
second gentleman but pray how pass'd it
first gentleman i'll tell you in a little the great duke
 came to the bar where to his accusations
 he pleaded still not guilty and alleged
 many sharp reasons to defeat the law
 the king's attorney on the contrary
 urged on the examinations proofs confessions
 of divers witnesses which the duke desired
 to have brought viva voce to his face
 at which appear'd against him his surveyor
 sir gilbert peck his chancellor and john car
 confessor to him with that devilmonk
 hopkins that made this mischief
second gentleman that was he
 that fed him with his prophecies
first gentleman the same
 all these accused him strongly which he fain
 would have flung from him but indeed he could not
 and so his peers upon this evidence
 have found him guilty of high treason much
 he spoke and learnedly for life but all
 was either pitied in him or forgotten
second gentleman after all this how did he bear himself
first gentleman when he was brought again to the bar to hear
 his knell rung out his judgment he was stirr'd
 with such an agony he sweat extremely
 and something spoke in choler ill and hasty
 but he fell to himself again and sweetly
 in all the rest show'd a most noble patience
second gentleman i do not think he fears death
first gentleman sure he does not
 he never was so womanish the cause
 he may a little grieve at
second gentleman certainly
 the cardinal is the end of this
first gentleman tis likely
 by all conjectures first kildare's attainder
 then deputy of ireland who removed
 earl surrey was sent thither and in haste too
 lest he should help his father
second gentleman that trick of state
 was a deep envious one
first gentleman at his return
 no doubt he will requite it this is noted
 and generally whoever the king favours
 the cardinal instantly will find employment
 and far enough from court too
second gentleman all the commons
 hate him perniciously and o my conscience
 wish him ten fathom deep this duke as much
 they love and dote on call him bounteous buckingham
 the mirror of all courtesy
first gentleman stay there sir
 and see the noble ruin'd man you speak of
 enter buckingham from his arraignment tipstaves
