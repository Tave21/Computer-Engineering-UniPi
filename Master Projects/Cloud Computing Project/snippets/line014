and he slew it and moses took the blood and put it upon the horns of the altar round about with his finger and purified the altar and poured the blood at the bottom of the altar and sanctified it to make reconciliation upon it
and he took all the fat that was upon the inwards and the caul above the liver and the two kidneys and their fat and moses burned it upon the altar

and moses said unto aaron and to his sons boil the flesh at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation and there eat it with the bread that is in the basket of consecrations as i commanded saying aaron and his sons shall eat it
and that which remaineth of the flesh and of the bread shall ye burn with fire
and ye shall not go out of the door of the tabernacle of the congregation in seven days until the days of your consecration be at an end for seven days shall he consecrate you
as he hath done this day so the lord hath commanded to do to make an atonement for you
therefore shall ye abide at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation day and night seven days and keep the charge of the lord that ye die not for so i am commanded
so aaron and his sons did all things which the lord commanded by the hand of moses
and it came to pass on the eighth day that moses called aaron and his sons and the elders of israel
and he said unto aaron take thee a young calf for a sin offering and a ram for a burnt offering without blemish and offer them before the lord
and unto the children of israel thou shalt speak saying take ye a kid of the goats for a sin offering and a calf and a lamb both of the first year without blemish for a burnt offering
also a bullock and a ram for peace offerings to sacrifice before the lord and a meat offering mingled with oil for to day the lord will appear unto you
and they brought that which moses commanded before the tabernacle of the congregation and all the congregation drew near and stood before the lord
and moses said this is the thing which the lord commanded that ye should do and the glory of the lord shall appear unto you
and moses said unto aaron go unto the altar and offer thy sin offering and thy burnt offering and make an atonement for thyself and for the people and offer the offering of the people and make an atonement for them as the lord commanded
aaron therefore went unto the altar and slew the calf of the sin offering which was for himself
and the sons of aaron brought the blood unto him and he dipped his finger in the blood and put it upon the horns of the altar and poured out the blood at the bottom of the altar
but the fat and the kidneys and the caul above the liver of the sin offering he burnt upon the altar as the lord commanded moses
and the flesh and the hide he burnt with fire without the camp
and he slew the burnt offering and aaron's sons presented unto him the blood which he sprinkled round about upon the altar
and they presented the burnt offering unto him with the pieces thereof and the head and he burnt them upon the altar
and he did wash the inwards and the legs and burnt them upon the burnt offering on the altar
and he brought the people's offering and took the goat which was the sin offering for the people and slew it and offered it for sin as the first
and he brought the burnt offering and offered it according to the manner
and he brought the meat offering and took an handful thereof and burnt it upon the altar beside the burnt sacrifice of the morning
he slew also the bullock and the ram for a sacrifice of peace offerings which was for the people and aaron's sons presented unto him the blood which he sprinkled upon the altar round about
and the fat of the bullock and of the ram the rump and that which covereth the inwards and the kidneys and the caul above the liver
and they put the fat upon the breasts and he burnt the fat upon the altar
and the breasts and the right shoulder aaron waved for a wave offering before the lord as moses commanded
and aaron lifted up his hand toward the people and blessed them and came down from offering of the sin offering and the burnt offering and peace offerings
and moses and aaron went into the tabernacle of the congregation and came out and blessed the people and the glory of the lord appeared unto all the people
and there came a fire out from before the lord and consumed upon the altar the burnt offering and the fat which when all the people saw they shouted and fell on their faces
and nadab and abihu the sons of aaron took either of them his censer and put fire therein and put incense thereon and offered strange fire before the lord which he commanded them not
and there went out fire from the lord and devoured them and they died before the lord
then moses said unto aaron this is it that the lord spake saying i will be sanctified in them that come nigh me and before all the people i will be glorified and aaron held his peace
and moses called mishael and elzaphan the sons of uzziel the uncle of aaron and said unto them come near carry your brethren from before the sanctuary out of the camp
so they went near and carried them in their coats out of the camp as moses had said
and moses said unto aaron and unto eleazar and unto ithamar his sons uncover not your heads neither rend your clothes lest ye die and lest wrath come upon all the people but let your brethren the whole house of israel bewail the burning which the lord hath kindled
and ye shall not go out from the door of the tabernacle of the congregation lest ye die for the anointing oil of the lord is upon you and they did according to the word of moses
and the lord spake unto aaron saying
do not drink wine nor strong drink thou nor thy sons with thee when ye go into the tabernacle of the congregation lest ye die it shall be a statute for ever throughout your generations
and that ye may put difference between holy and unholy and between unclean and clean
and that ye may teach the children of israel all the statutes which the lord hath spoken unto them by the hand of moses
and moses spake unto aaron and unto eleazar and unto ithamar his sons that were left take the meat offering that remaineth of the offerings of the lord made by fire and eat it without leaven beside the altar for it is most holy
and ye shall eat it in the holy place because it is thy due and thy sons due of the sacrifices of the lord made by fire for so i am commanded
and the wave breast and heave shoulder shall ye eat in a clean place thou and thy sons and thy daughters with thee for they be thy due and thy sons due which are given out of the sacrifices of peace offerings of the children of israel
the heave shoulder and the wave breast shall they bring with the offerings made by fire of the fat to wave it for a wave offering before the lord and it shall be thine and thy sons with thee by a statute for ever as the lord hath commanded
and moses diligently sought the goat of the sin offering and behold it was burnt and he was angry with eleazar and ithamar the sons of aaron which were left alive saying
wherefore have ye not eaten the sin offering in the holy place seeing it is most holy and god hath given it you to bear the iniquity of the congregation to make atonement for them before the lord
behold the blood of it was not brought in within the holy place ye should indeed have eaten it in the holy place as i commanded
and aaron said unto moses behold this day have they offered their sin offering and their burnt offering before the lord and such things have befallen me and if i had eaten the sin offering to day should it have been accepted in the sight of the lord
and when moses heard that he was content
