and they that watch see time how slow it creeps
which all this time hath overslipp'd her thought
that she with painted images hath spent
being from the feeling of her own grief brought
by deep surmise of others detriment
losing her woes in shows of discontent
it easeth some though none it ever cured
to think their dolour others have endured
but now the mindful messenger come back
brings home his lord and other company
who finds his lucrece clad in mourning black
and round about her tearstained eye
blue circles stream'd like rainbows in the sky
these watergalls in her dim element
foretell new storms to those already spent
which when her sadbeholding husband saw
amazedly in her sad face he stares
her eyes though sod in tears look'd red and raw
her lively colour kill'd with deadly cares
he hath no power to ask her how she fares
both stood like old acquaintance in a trance
met far from home wondering each other's chance
at last he takes her by the bloodless hand
and thus begins what uncouth ill event
hath thee befall'n that thou dost trembling stand
sweet love what spite hath thy fair colour spent
why art thou thus attired in discontent
unmask dear dear this moody heaviness
and tell thy grief that we may give redress'
three times with sighs she gives her sorrow fire
ere once she can discharge one word of woe
at length address'd to answer his desire
she modestly prepares to let them know
her honour is ta'en prisoner by the foe
while collatine and his consorted lords
with sad attention long to hear her words
and now this pale swan in her watery nest
begins the sad dirge of her certain ending
'few words quoth she shall fit the trespass best
where no excuse can give the fault amending
in me moe woes than words are now depending
and my laments would be drawn out too long
to tell them all with one poor tired tongue
'then be this all the task it hath to say
dear husband in the interest of thy bed
a stranger came and on that pillow lay
where thou was wont to rest thy weary head
and what wrong else may be imagined
by foul enforcement might be done to me
from that alas thy lucrece is not free
'for in the dreadful dead of dark midnight
with shining falchion in my chamber came
a creeping creature with a flaming light
and softly cried awake thou roman dame
and entertain my love else lasting shame
on thee and thine this night i will inflict
if thou my love's desire do contradict
 for some hardfavour'd groom of thine quoth he
'unless thou yoke thy liking to my will
i'll murder straight and then i'll slaughter thee
and swear i found you where you did fulfil
the loathsome act of lust and so did kill
the lechers in their deed this act will be
my fame and thy perpetual infamy'
'with this i did begin to start and cry
and then against my heart he sets his sword
swearing unless i took all patiently
i should not live to speak another word
so should my shame still rest upon record
and never be forgot in mighty rome
th adulterate death of lucrece and her groom
'mine enemy was strong my poor self weak
and far the weaker with so strong a fear
my bloody judge forbade my tongue to speak
no rightful plea might plead for justice there
his scarlet lust came evidence to swear
that my poor beauty had purloin'd his eyes
and when the judge is robb'd the prisoner dies
'o teach me how to make mine own excuse
or at the least this refuge let me find
though my gross blood be stain'd with this abuse
immaculate and spotless is my mind
that was not forced that never was inclined
to accessary yieldings but still pure
doth in her poison'd closet yet endure'
lo here the hopeless merchant of this loss
with head declined and voice damm'd up with woe
with sad set eyes and wretched arms across
from lips newwaxen pale begins to blow
the grief away that stops his answer so
but wretched as he is he strives in vain
what he breathes out his breath drinks up again
as through an arch the violent roaring tide
outruns the eye that doth behold his haste
yet in the eddy boundeth in his pride
back to the strait that forced him on so fast
in rage sent out recall'd in rage being past
even so his sighs his sorrows make a saw
to push grief on and back the same grief draw
which speechless woe of his poor she attendeth
and his untimely frenzy thus awaketh
'dear lord thy sorrow to my sorrow lendeth
another power no flood by raining slaketh
my woe too sensible thy passion maketh
more feelingpainful let it then suffice
to drown one woe one pair of weeping eyes
'and for my sake when i might charm thee so
for she that was thy lucrece now attend me
be suddenly revenged on my foe
thine mine his own suppose thou dost defend me
from what is past the help that thou shalt lend me
comes all too late yet let the traitor die
for sparing justice feeds iniquity
'but ere i name him you fair lords quoth she
speaking to those that came with collatine
'shall plight your honourable faiths to me
with swift pursuit to venge this wrong of mine
for tis a meritorious fair design
to chase injustice with revengeful arms
knights by their oaths should right poor ladies harms'
at this request with noble disposition
each present lord began to promise aid
as bound in knighthood to her imposition
longing to hear the hateful foe bewray'd
but she that yet her sad task hath not said
the protestation stops o speak  quoth she
'how may this forced stain be wiped from me
'what is the quality of mine offence
being constrain'd with dreadful circumstance
may my pure mind with the foul act dispense
my lowdeclined honour to advance
may any terms acquit me from this chance
the poison'd fountain clears itself again
and why not i from this compelled stain'
with this they all at once began to say
her body's stain her mind untainted clears
while with a joyless smile she turns away
the face that map which deep impression bears
of hard misfortune carved in it with tears
'no no quoth she no dame hereafter living
by my excuse shall claim excuse's giving'
here with a sigh as if her heart would break
she throws forth tarquin's name he he she says
but more than he her poor tongue could not speak
till after many accents and delays
untimely breathings sick and short assays
she utters this he he fair lords tis he
that guides this hand to give this wound to me'
even here she sheathed in her harmless breast
a harmful knife that thence her soul unsheathed
that blow did that it from the deep unrest
of that polluted prison where it breathed
her contrite sighs unto the clouds bequeath'd
her winged sprite and through her wounds doth fly
life's lasting date from cancell'd destiny
stonestill astonish'd with this deadly deed
stood collatine and all his lordly crew
till lucrece father that beholds her bleed
himself on her selfslaughter'd body threw
and from the purple fountain brutus drew
the murderous knife and as it left the place
her blood in poor revenge held it in chase
and bubbling from her breast it doth divide
in two slow rivers that the crimson blood
circles her body in on every side
who like a latesack'd island vastly stood
bare and unpeopled in this fearful flood
some of her blood still pure and red remain'd
and some look'd black and that false tarquin stain'd
about the mourning and congealed face
of that black blood a watery rigol goes
which seems to weep upon the tainted place
and ever since as pitying lucrece woes
corrupted blood some watery token shows
and blood untainted still doth red abide
blushing at that which is so putrified
'daughter dear daughter old lucretius cries
'that life was mine which thou hast here deprived
if in the child the father's image lies
where shall i live now lucrece is unlived
thou wast not to this end from me derived
if children predecease progenitors
we are their offspring and they none of ours
'poor broken glass i often did behold
in thy sweet semblance my old age new born
but now that fresh fair mirror dim and old
shows me a bareboned death by time outworn
o from thy cheeks my image thou hast torn
and shivered all the beauty of my glass
that i no more can see what once i was
'o time cease thou thy course and last no longer
if they surcease to be that should survive
shall rotten death make conquest of the stronger
and leave the faltering feeble souls alive
the old bees die the young possess their hive
then live sweet lucrece live again and see
thy father die and not thy father thee
by this starts collatine as from a dream
and bids lucretius give his sorrow place
and then in keycold lucrece bleeding stream
