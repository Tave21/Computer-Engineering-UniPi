 endure our law thou'rt dead
imogen that headless man
 i thought had been my lord
cymbeline bind the offender
 and take him from our presence
belarius stay sir king
 this man is better than the man he slew
 as well descended as thyself and hath
 more of thee merited than a band of clotens
 had ever scar for
 to the guard
 let his arms alone
 they were not born for bondage
cymbeline why old soldier
 wilt thou undo the worth thou art unpaid for
 by tasting of our wrath how of descent
 as good as we
arviragus in that he spake too far
cymbeline and thou shalt die for't
belarius we will die all three
 but i will prove that two on's are as good
 as i have given out him my sons i must
 for mine own part unfold a dangerous speech
 though haply well for you
arviragus your danger's ours
guiderius and our good his
belarius have at it then by leave
 thou hadst great king a subject who
 was call'd belarius
cymbeline what of him he is
 a banish'd traitor
belarius he it is that hath
 assumed this age indeed a banish'd man
 i know not how a traitor
cymbeline take him hence
 the whole world shall not save him
belarius not too hot
 first pay me for the nursing of thy sons
 and let it be confiscate all so soon
 as i have received it
cymbeline nursing of my sons
belarius i am too blunt and saucy here's my knee
 ere i arise i will prefer my sons
 then spare not the old father mighty sir
 these two young gentlemen that call me father
 and think they are my sons are none of mine
 they are the issue of your loins my liege
 and blood of your begetting
cymbeline how my issue
belarius so sure as you your father's i old morgan
 am that belarius whom you sometime banish'd
 your pleasure was my mere offence my punishment
 itself and all my treason that i suffer'd
 was all the harm i did these gentle princes
 for such and so they arethese twenty years
 have i train'd up those arts they have as i
 could put into them my breeding was sir as
 your highness knows their nurse euriphile
 whom for the theft i wedded stole these children
 upon my banishment i moved her to't
 having received the punishment before
 for that which i did then beaten for loyalty
 excited me to treason their dear loss
 the more of you twas felt the more it shaped
 unto my end of stealing them but gracious sir
 here are your sons again and i must lose
 two of the sweet'st companions in the world
 the benediction of these covering heavens
 fall on their heads like dew for they are worthy
 to inlay heaven with stars
cymbeline thou weep'st and speak'st
 the service that you three have done is more
 unlike than this thou tell'st i lost my children
 if these be they i know not how to wish
 a pair of worthier sons
belarius be pleased awhile
 this gentleman whom i call polydore
 most worthy prince as yours is true guiderius
 this gentleman my cadwal arviragus
 your younger princely son he sir was lapp'd
 in a most curious mantle wrought by the hand
 of his queen mother which for more probation
 i can with ease produce
cymbeline guiderius had
 upon his neck a mole a sanguine star
 it was a mark of wonder
belarius this is he
 who hath upon him still that natural stamp
 it was wise nature's end in the donation
 to be his evidence now
cymbeline o what am i
 a mother to the birth of three ne'er mother
 rejoiced deliverance more blest pray you be
 that after this strange starting from your orbs
 may reign in them now o imogen
 thou hast lost by this a kingdom
imogen no my lord
 i have got two worlds by t o my gentle brothers
 have we thus met o never say hereafter
 but i am truest speaker you call'd me brother
 when i was but your sister i you brothers
 when ye were so indeed
cymbeline did you e'er meet
arviragus ay my good lord
guiderius and at first meeting loved
 continued so until we thought he died
cornelius by the queen's dram she swallow'd
cymbeline o rare instinct
 when shall i hear all through this fierce
 abridgement
 hath to it circumstantial branches which
 distinction should be rich in where how lived you
 and when came you to serve our roman captive
 how parted with your brothers how first met them
 why fled you from the court and whither these
 and your three motives to the battle with
 i know not how much more should be demanded
 and all the other bydependencies
 from chance to chance but nor the time nor place
 will serve our long inter'gatories see
 posthumus anchors upon imogen
 and she like harmless lightning throws her eye
 on him her brother me her master hitting
 each object with a joy the counterchange
 is severally in all let's quit this ground
 and smoke the temple with our sacrifices
 to belarius
 thou art my brother so we'll hold thee ever
imogen you are my father too and did relieve me
 to see this gracious season
cymbeline all o'erjoy'd
 save these in bonds let them be joyful too
 for they shall taste our comfort
imogen my good master
 i will yet do you service
caius lucius happy be you
cymbeline the forlorn soldier that so nobly fought
 he would have well becomed this place and graced
 the thankings of a king
posthumus leonatus i am sir
 the soldier that did company these three
 in poor beseeming twas a fitment for
 the purpose i then follow'd that i was he
 speak iachimo i had you down and might
 have made you finish
iachimo kneeling i am down again
 but now my heavy conscience sinks my knee
 as then your force did take that life beseech you
 which i so often owe but your ring first
 and here the bracelet of the truest princess
 that ever swore her faith
posthumus leonatus kneel not to me
 the power that i have on you is to spare you
 the malice towards you to forgive you live
 and deal with others better
cymbeline nobly doom'd
 we'll learn our freeness of a soninlaw
 pardon's the word to all
arviragus you holp us sir
 as you did mean indeed to be our brother
 joy'd are we that you are
posthumus leonatus your servant princes good my lord of rome
 call forth your soothsayer as i slept methought
 great jupiter upon his eagle back'd
 appear'd to me with other spritely shows
 of mine own kindred when i waked i found
 this label on my bosom whose containing
 is so from sense in hardness that i can
 make no collection of it let him show
 his skill in the construction
caius lucius philarmonus
soothsayer here my good lord
caius lucius read and declare the meaning
soothsayer reads when as a lion's whelp shall to himself
 unknown without seeking find and be embraced by a
 piece of tender air and when from a stately cedar
 shall be lopped branches which being dead many
 years shall after revive be jointed to the old
 stock and freshly grow then shall posthumus end
 his miseries britain be fortunate and flourish in
 peace and plenty'
 thou leonatus art the lion's whelp
 the fit and apt construction of thy name
 being leonatus doth import so much
 to cymbeline
 the piece of tender air thy virtuous daughter
 which we call mollis aer and mollis aer'
 we term it mulier which mulier i divine
 is this most constant wife who even now
 answering the letter of the oracle
 unknown to you unsought were clipp'd about
 with this most tender air
cymbeline this hath some seeming
soothsayer the lofty cedar royal cymbeline
 personates thee and thy lopp'd branches point
 thy two sons forth who by belarius stol'n
 for many years thought dead are now revived
 to the majestic cedar join'd whose issue
 promises britain peace and plenty
cymbeline well
