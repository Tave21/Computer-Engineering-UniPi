 counterfeitly that is sir i will counterfeit the
 bewitchment of some popular man and give it
 bountiful to the desirers therefore beseech you
 i may be consul
fifth citizen we hope to find you our friend and therefore give
 you our voices heartily
fourth citizen you have received many wounds for your country
coriolanus i will not seal your knowledge with showing them i
 will make much of your voices and so trouble you no further
both citizens the gods give you joy sir heartily
 exeunt
coriolanus most sweet voices
 better it is to die better to starve
 than crave the hire which first we do deserve
 why in this woolvish toge should i stand here
 to beg of hob and dick that do appear
 their needless vouches custom calls me to't
 what custom wills in all things should we do't
 the dust on antique time would lie unswept
 and mountainous error be too highly heapt
 for truth to o'erpeer rather than fool it so
 let the high office and the honour go
 to one that would do thus i am half through
 the one part suffer'd the other will i do
 reenter three citizens more
 here come more voices
 your voices for your voices i have fought
 watch'd for your voices for your voices bear
 of wounds two dozen odd battles thrice six
 i have seen and heard of for your voices have
 done many things some less some more your voices
 indeed i would be consul
sixth citizen he has done nobly and cannot go without any honest
 man's voice
seventh citizen therefore let him be consul the gods give him joy
 and make him good friend to the people
all citizens amen amen god save thee noble consul
 exeunt
coriolanus worthy voices
 reenter menenius with brutus and sicinius
menenius you have stood your limitation and the tribunes
 endue you with the people's voice remains
 that in the official marks invested you
 anon do meet the senate
coriolanus is this done
sicinius the custom of request you have discharged
 the people do admit you and are summon'd
 to meet anon upon your approbation
coriolanus where at the senatehouse
sicinius there coriolanus
coriolanus may i change these garments
sicinius you may sir
coriolanus that i'll straight do and knowing myself again
 repair to the senatehouse
menenius i'll keep you company will you along
brutus we stay here for the people
sicinius fare you well
 exeunt coriolanus and menenius
 he has it now and by his looks methink
 tis warm at s heart
brutus with a proud heart he wore his humble weeds
 will you dismiss the people
 reenter citizens
sicinius how now my masters have you chose this man
first citizen he has our voices sir
brutus we pray the gods he may deserve your loves
second citizen amen sir to my poor unworthy notice
 he mock'd us when he begg'd our voices
third citizen certainly
 he flouted us downright
first citizen no'tis his kind of speech he did not mock us
second citizen not one amongst us save yourself but says
 he used us scornfully he should have show'd us
 his marks of merit wounds received for's country
sicinius why so he did i am sure
citizens no no no man saw em
third citizen he said he had wounds which he could show
 in private
 and with his hat thus waving it in scorn
 i would be consul says he aged custom
 but by your voices will not so permit me
 your voices therefore when we granted that
 here was i thank you for your voices thank you
 your most sweet voices now you have left
 your voices
 i have no further with you was not this mockery
sicinius why either were you ignorant to see't
 or seeing it of such childish friendliness
 to yield your voices
brutus could you not have told him
 as you were lesson'd when he had no power
 but was a petty servant to the state
 he was your enemy ever spake against
 your liberties and the charters that you bear
 i the body of the weal and now arriving
 a place of potency and sway o the state
 if he should still malignantly remain
 fast foe to the plebeii your voices might
 be curses to yourselves you should have said
 that as his worthy deeds did claim no less
 than what he stood for so his gracious nature
 would think upon you for your voices and
 translate his malice towards you into love
 standing your friendly lord
sicinius thus to have said
 as you were foreadvised had touch'd his spirit
 and tried his inclination from him pluck'd
 either his gracious promise which you might
 as cause had call'd you up have held him to
 or else it would have gall'd his surly nature
 which easily endures not article
 tying him to aught so putting him to rage
 you should have ta'en the advantage of his choler
 and pass'd him unelected
brutus did you perceive
 he did solicit you in free contempt
 when he did need your loves and do you think
 that his contempt shall not be bruising to you
 when he hath power to crush why had your bodies
 no heart among you or had you tongues to cry
 against the rectorship of judgment
sicinius have you
 ere now denied the asker and now again
 of him that did not ask but mock bestow
 your suedfor tongues
third citizen he's not confirm'd we may deny him yet
second citizen and will deny him
 i'll have five hundred voices of that sound
first citizen i twice five hundred and their friends to piece em
brutus get you hence instantly and tell those friends
 they have chose a consul that will from them take
 their liberties make them of no more voice
 than dogs that are as often beat for barking
 as therefore kept to do so
sicinius let them assemble
 and on a safer judgment all revoke
 your ignorant election enforce his pride
 and his old hate unto you besides forget not
 with what contempt he wore the humble weed
 how in his suit he scorn'd you but your loves
 thinking upon his services took from you
 the apprehension of his present portance
 which most gibingly ungravely he did fashion
 after the inveterate hate he bears you
brutus lay
 a fault on us your tribunes that we laboured
 no impediment between but that you must
 cast your election on him
sicinius say you chose him
 more after our commandment than as guided
 by your own true affections and that your minds
 preoccupied with what you rather must do
 than what you should made you against the grain
 to voice him consul lay the fault on us
brutus ay spare us not say we read lectures to you
 how youngly he began to serve his country
 how long continued and what stock he springs of
 the noble house o the marcians from whence came
 that ancus marcius numa's daughter's son
 who after great hostilius here was king
 of the same house publius and quintus were
 that our beat water brought by conduits hither
 and censorinus nobly named so
 twice being by the people chosen censor
 was his great ancestor
sicinius one thus descended
 that hath beside well in his person wrought
 to be set high in place we did commend
 to your remembrances but you have found
 scaling his present bearing with his past
 that he's your fixed enemy and revoke
 your sudden approbation
brutus say you ne'er had done't
 harp on that stillbut by our putting on
 and presently when you have drawn your number
 repair to the capitol
all we will so almost all
 repent in their election
 exeunt citizens
brutus let them go on
 this mutiny were better put in hazard
 than stay past doubt for greater
 if as his nature is he fall in rage
 with their refusal both observe and answer
 the vantage of his anger
sicinius to the capitol come
 we will be there before the stream o the people
 and this shall seem as partly tis their own
 which we have goaded onward

act iii
scene i rome a street
 cornets enter coriolanus menenius all the
 gentry cominius titus lartius and other senators

lartius he had my lord and that it was which caused
 our swifter composition

 ready when time shall prompt them to make road
