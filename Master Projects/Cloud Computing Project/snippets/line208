guildenstern the king sir
hamlet ay sir what of him
guildenstern is in his retirement marvellous distempered
hamlet with drink sir
guildenstern no my lord rather with choler
hamlet your wisdom should show itself more richer to
 signify this to his doctor for for me to put him
 to his purgation would perhaps plunge him into far
 more choler
guildenstern good my lord put your discourse into some frame and
 start not so wildly from my affair

 go to bed
hamlet we shall obey were she ten times our mother have
 you any further trade with us
rosencrantz my lord you once did love me
hamlet so i do still by these pickers and stealers
rosencrantz good my lord what is your cause of distemper you
 do surely bar the door upon your own liberty if
 you deny your griefs to your friend
hamlet sir i lack advancement
rosencrantz how can that be when you have the voice of the king
 himself for your succession in denmark
hamlet ay but sir while the grass grows'the proverb
 is something musty
 reenter players with recorders
 o the recorders let me see one to withdraw with
 youwhy do you go about to recover the wind of me
 as if you would drive me into a toil
guildenstern o my lord if my duty be too bold my love is too
 unmannerly
hamlet i do not well understand that will you play upon
 this pipe

guildenstern i know no touch of it my lord
hamlet tis as easy as lying govern these ventages with
 your lingers and thumb give it breath with your
 mouth and it will discourse most eloquent music
 look you these are the stops
guildenstern but these cannot i command to any utterance of
 harmony i have not the skill
hamlet why look you now how unworthy a thing you make of
 me you would play upon me you would seem to know
 my stops you would pluck out the heart of my
 mystery you would sound me from my lowest note to
 the top of my compass and there is much music
 excellent voice in this little organ yet cannot
 you make it speak sblood do you think i am
 easier to be played on than a pipe call me what
 instrument you will though you can fret me yet you
 cannot play upon me

lord polonius i will say so
hamlet by and by is easily said
 exit polonius
 leave me friends
 exeunt all but hamlet
 tis now the very witching time of night
 when churchyards yawn and hell itself breathes out
 contagion to this world now could i drink hot blood
 and do such bitter business as the day
 would quake to look on soft now to my mother
 o heart lose not thy nature let not ever
 the soul of nero enter this firm bosom
 let me be cruel not unnatural
 i will speak daggers to her but use none
 my tongue and soul in this be hypocrites
 how in my words soever she be shent
 to give them seals never my soul consent
 exit
 hamlet
act iii
scene iii a room in the castle
 enter king claudius rosencrantz and guildenstern
king claudius i like him not nor stands it safe with us
 to let his madness range therefore prepare you
 i your commission will forthwith dispatch
 and he to england shall along with you
 the terms of our estate may not endure
 hazard so dangerous as doth hourly grow
 out of his lunacies
guildenstern we will ourselves provide
 most holy and religious fear it is
 to keep those many many bodies safe
 that live and feed upon your majesty
rosencrantz the single and peculiar life is bound
 with all the strength and armour of the mind
 to keep itself from noyance but much more
 that spirit upon whose weal depend and rest
 the lives of many the cease of majesty
