 but as you will not wed i'll pardon you
 graze where you will you shall not house with me
 look to't think on't i do not use to jest
 thursday is near lay hand on heart advise
 an you be mine i'll give you to my friend
 and you be not hang beg starve die in
 the streets
 for by my soul i'll ne'er acknowledge thee
 nor what is mine shall never do thee good
 trust to't bethink you i'll not be forsworn
 exit
juliet is there no pity sitting in the clouds
 that sees into the bottom of my grief
 o sweet my mother cast me not away
 delay this marriage for a month a week
 or if you do not make the bridal bed
 in that dim monument where tybalt lies
lady capulet talk not to me for i'll not speak a word
 do as thou wilt for i have done with thee
 exit
juliet o godo nurse how shall this be prevented
 my husband is on earth my faith in heaven
 how shall that faith return again to earth
 unless that husband send it me from heaven
 by leaving earth comfort me counsel me
 alack alack that heaven should practise stratagems
 upon so soft a subject as myself
 what say'st thou hast thou not a word of joy
 some comfort nurse
nurse faith here it is
 romeo is banish'd and all the world to nothing
 that he dares ne'er come back to challenge you
 or if he do it needs must be by stealth
 then since the case so stands as now it doth
 i think it best you married with the county
 o he's a lovely gentleman
 romeo's a dishclout to him an eagle madam
 hath not so green so quick so fair an eye
 as paris hath beshrew my very heart
 i think you are happy in this second match
 for it excels your first or if it did not
 your first is dead or twere as good he were
 as living here and you no use of him
juliet speakest thou from thy heart
nurse and from my soul too
 or else beshrew them both
juliet amen
nurse what
juliet well thou hast comforted me marvellous much
 go in and tell my lady i am gone
 having displeased my father to laurence cell
 to make confession and to be absolved
nurse marry i will and this is wisely done
 exit
juliet ancient damnation o most wicked fiend
 is it more sin to wish me thus forsworn
 or to dispraise my lord with that same tongue
 which she hath praised him with above compare
 so many thousand times go counsellor
 thou and my bosom henceforth shall be twain
 i'll to the friar to know his remedy
 if all else fail myself have power to die
 exit
 romeo and juliet
act iv
scene i friar laurence's cell
 enter friar laurence and paris
friar laurence on thursday sir the time is very short
paris my father capulet will have it so
 and i am nothing slow to slack his haste
friar laurence you say you do not know the lady's mind
 uneven is the course i like it not
paris immoderately she weeps for tybalt's death
 and therefore have i little talk'd of love
 for venus smiles not in a house of tears
 now sir her father counts it dangerous
 that she doth give her sorrow so much sway
 and in his wisdom hastes our marriage
 to stop the inundation of her tears
 which too much minded by herself alone
 may be put from her by society
 now do you know the reason of this haste
friar laurence aside i would i knew not why it should be slow'd
 look sir here comes the lady towards my cell
 enter juliet
paris happily met my lady and my wife
juliet that may be sir when i may be a wife
paris that may be must be love on thursday next
juliet what must be shall be
friar laurence that's a certain text
paris come you to make confession to this father
juliet to answer that i should confess to you
paris do not deny to him that you love me
juliet i will confess to you that i love him
paris so will ye i am sure that you love me
juliet if i do so it will be of more price
 being spoke behind your back than to your face
paris poor soul thy face is much abused with tears
juliet the tears have got small victory by that
 for it was bad enough before their spite
paris thou wrong'st it more than tears with that report
juliet that is no slander sir which is a truth
 and what i spake i spake it to my face
paris thy face is mine and thou hast slander'd it
juliet it may be so for it is not mine own
 are you at leisure holy father now
 or shall i come to you at evening mass
friar laurence my leisure serves me pensive daughter now
 my lord we must entreat the time alone
paris god shield i should disturb devotion
 juliet on thursday early will i rouse ye
 till then adieu and keep this holy kiss
 exit
juliet o shut the door and when thou hast done so
 come weep with me past hope past cure past help
friar laurence ah juliet i already know thy grief
 it strains me past the compass of my wits
 i hear thou must and nothing may prorogue it
 on thursday next be married to this county
juliet tell me not friar that thou hear'st of this
 unless thou tell me how i may prevent it
 if in thy wisdom thou canst give no help
 do thou but call my resolution wise
 and with this knife i'll help it presently
 god join'd my heart and romeo's thou our hands
 and ere this hand by thee to romeo seal'd
 shall be the label to another deed
 or my true heart with treacherous revolt
 turn to another this shall slay them both
 therefore out of thy longexperienced time
 give me some present counsel or behold
 twixt my extremes and me this bloody knife
 shall play the umpire arbitrating that
 which the commission of thy years and art
 could to no issue of true honour bring
 be not so long to speak i long to die
 if what thou speak'st speak not of remedy
friar laurence hold daughter i do spy a kind of hope
 which craves as desperate an execution
 as that is desperate which we would prevent
 if rather than to marry county paris
 thou hast the strength of will to slay thyself
 then is it likely thou wilt undertake
 a thing like death to chide away this shame
 that copest with death himself to scape from it
 and if thou darest i'll give thee remedy
juliet o bid me leap rather than marry paris
 from off the battlements of yonder tower
 or walk in thievish ways or bid me lurk
 where serpents are chain me with roaring bears
 or shut me nightly in a charnelhouse
 o'ercover'd quite with dead men's rattling bones
 with reeky shanks and yellow chapless skulls
 or bid me go into a newmade grave
 and hide me with a dead man in his shroud
 things that to hear them told have made me tremble
 and i will do it without fear or doubt
 to live an unstain'd wife to my sweet love
friar laurence hold then go home be merry give consent
 to marry paris wednesday is tomorrow
 tomorrow night look that thou lie alone
 let not thy nurse lie with thee in thy chamber
 take thou this vial being then in bed
 and this distilled liquor drink thou off
 when presently through all thy veins shall run
 a cold and drowsy humour for no pulse
 shall keep his native progress but surcease
 no warmth no breath shall testify thou livest
 the roses in thy lips and cheeks shall fade
 to paly ashes thy eyes windows fall
 like death when he shuts up the day of life
 each part deprived of supple government
 shall stiff and stark and cold appear like death
 and in this borrow'd likeness of shrunk death
 thou shalt continue two and forty hours
 and then awake as from a pleasant sleep
 now when the bridegroom in the morning comes
 to rouse thee from thy bed there art thou dead
 then as the manner of our country is
 in thy best robes uncover'd on the bier
 thou shalt be borne to that same ancient vault
 where all the kindred of the capulets lie
 in the mean time against thou shalt awake
 shall romeo by my letters know our drift
 and hither shall he come and he and i
 will watch thy waking and that very night
 shall romeo bear thee hence to mantua
 and this shall free thee from this present shame
 if no inconstant toy nor womanish fear
 abate thy valour in the acting it
juliet give me give me o tell not me of fear
friar laurence hold get you gone be strong and prosperous
 in this resolve i'll send a friar with speed
 to mantua with my letters to thy lord
juliet love give me strength and strength shall help afford
 farewell dear father
