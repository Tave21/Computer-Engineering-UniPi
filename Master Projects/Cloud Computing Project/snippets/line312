 from forth thy plenteous bosom one poor root
 ensear thy fertile and conceptious womb
 let it no more bring out ingrateful man
 go great with tigers dragons wolves and bears
 teem with new monsters whom thy upward face
 hath to the marbled mansion all above
 never presentedo a rootdear thanks
 dry up thy marrows vines and ploughtorn leas
 whereof ungrateful man with liquorish draughts
 and morsels unctuous greases his pure mind
 that from it all consideration slips
 enter apemantus
 more man plague plague
apemantus i was directed hither men report
 thou dost affect my manners and dost use them
timon tis then because thou dost not keep a dog
 whom i would imitate consumption catch thee
apemantus this is in thee a nature but infected
 a poor unmanly melancholy sprung
 from change of fortune why this spade this place
 this slavelike habit and these looks of care
 thy flatterers yet wear silk drink wine lie soft
 hug their diseased perfumes and have forgot
 that ever timon was shame not these woods
 by putting on the cunning of a carper
 be thou a flatterer now and seek to thrive
 by that which has undone thee hinge thy knee
 and let his very breath whom thou'lt observe
 blow off thy cap praise his most vicious strain
 and call it excellent thou wast told thus
 thou gavest thine ears like tapsters that bid welcome
 to knaves and all approachers tis most just
 that thou turn rascal hadst thou wealth again
 rascals should have t do not assume my likeness
timon were i like thee i'ld throw away myself
apemantus thou hast cast away thyself being like thyself
 a madman so long now a fool what think'st
 that the bleak air thy boisterous chamberlain
 will put thy shirt on warm will these moss'd trees
 that have outlived the eagle page thy heels
 and skip where thou point'st out will the
 cold brook
 candied with ice caudle thy morning taste
 to cure thy o'ernight's surfeit call the creatures
 whose naked natures live in an the spite
 of wreakful heaven whose bare unhoused trunks
 to the conflicting elements exposed
 answer mere nature bid them flatter thee
 o thou shalt find
timon a fool of thee depart
apemantus i love thee better now than e'er i did
timon i hate thee worse
apemantus why
timon thou flatter'st misery
apemantus i flatter not but say thou art a caitiff
timon why dost thou seek me out
apemantus to vex thee
timon always a villain's office or a fool's
 dost please thyself in't
apemantus ay
timon what a knave too
apemantus if thou didst put this sourcold habit on
 to castigate thy pride twere well but thou
 dost it enforcedly thou'ldst courtier be again
 wert thou not beggar willing misery
 outlives encertain pomp is crown'd before
 the one is filling still never complete
 the other at high wish best state contentless
 hath a distracted and most wretched being
 worse than the worst content
 thou shouldst desire to die being miserable
timon not by his breath that is more miserable
 thou art a slave whom fortune's tender arm
 with favour never clasp'd but bred a dog
 hadst thou like us from our first swath proceeded
 the sweet degrees that this brief world affords
 to such as may the passive drugs of it
 freely command thou wouldst have plunged thyself
 in general riot melted down thy youth
 in different beds of lust and never learn'd
 the icy precepts of respect but follow'd
 the sugar'd game before thee but myself
 who had the world as my confectionary
 the mouths the tongues the eyes and hearts of men
 at duty more than i could frame employment
 that numberless upon me stuck as leaves
 do on the oak hive with one winter's brush
 fell from their boughs and left me open bare
 for every storm that blows i to bear this
 that never knew but better is some burden
 thy nature did commence in sufferance time
 hath made thee hard in't why shouldst thou hate men
 they never flatter'd thee what hast thou given
 if thou wilt curse thy father that poor rag
 must be thy subject who in spite put stuff
 to some she beggar and compounded thee
 poor rogue hereditary hence be gone
 if thou hadst not been born the worst of men
 thou hadst been a knave and flatterer
apemantus art thou proud yet
timon ay that i am not thee
apemantus i that i was
 no prodigal
timon i that i am one now
 were all the wealth i have shut up in thee
 i'ld give thee leave to hang it get thee gone
 that the whole life of athens were in this
 thus would i eat it
 eating a root
apemantus here i will mend thy feast
 offering him a root
timon first mend my company take away thyself
apemantus so i shall mend mine own by the lack of thine
timon tis not well mended so it is but botch'd
 if not i would it were
apemantus what wouldst thou have to athens
timon thee thither in a whirlwind if thou wilt
 tell them there i have gold look so i have
apemantus here is no use for gold
timon the best and truest
 for here it sleeps and does no hired harm
apemantus where liest o nights timon
timon under that's above me
 where feed'st thou o days apemantus
apemantus where my stomach finds meat or rather where i eat
 it
timon would poison were obedient and knew my mind
apemantus where wouldst thou send it
timon to sauce thy dishes
apemantus the middle of humanity thou never knewest but the
 extremity of both ends when thou wast in thy gilt
 and thy perfume they mocked thee for too much
 curiosity in thy rags thou knowest none but art
 despised for the contrary there's a medlar for
 thee eat it
timon on what i hate i feed not
apemantus dost hate a medlar
timon ay though it look like thee
apemantus an thou hadst hated meddlers sooner thou shouldst
 have loved thyself better now what man didst thou
 ever know unthrift that was beloved after his means
timon who without those means thou talkest of didst thou
 ever know beloved
apemantus myself
timon i understand thee thou hadst some means to keep a
 dog
apemantus what things in the world canst thou nearest compare
 to thy flatterers
timon women nearest but men men are the things
 themselves what wouldst thou do with the world
 apemantus if it lay in thy power
apemantus give it the beasts to be rid of the men
timon wouldst thou have thyself fall in the confusion of
 men and remain a beast with the beasts
apemantus ay timon
timon a beastly ambition which the gods grant thee t'
 attain to if thou wert the lion the fox would
 beguile thee if thou wert the lamb the fox would
 eat three if thou wert the fox the lion would
 suspect thee when peradventure thou wert accused by
 the ass if thou wert the ass thy dulness would
 torment thee and still thou livedst but as a
 breakfast to the wolf if thou wert the wolf thy
 greediness would afflict thee and oft thou shouldst
 hazard thy life for thy dinner wert thou the
 unicorn pride and wrath would confound thee and
 make thine own self the conquest of thy fury wert
 thou a bear thou wouldst be killed by the horse
 wert thou a horse thou wouldst be seized by the
 leopard wert thou a leopard thou wert german to
 the lion and the spots of thy kindred were jurors on
 thy life all thy safety were remotion and thy
 defence absence what beast couldst thou be that
 were not subject to a beast and what a beast art
 thou already that seest not thy loss in
 transformation
apemantus if thou couldst please me with speaking to me thou
 mightst have hit upon it here the commonwealth of
 athens is become a forest of beasts
timon how has the ass broke the wall that thou art out of the city
apemantus yonder comes a poet and a painter the plague of
 company light upon thee i will fear to catch it
 and give way when i know not what else to do i'll
 see thee again
timon when there is nothing living but thee thou shalt be
 welcome i had rather be a beggar's dog than apemantus
apemantus thou art the cap of all the fools alive
timon would thou wert clean enough to spit upon
apemantus a plague on thee thou art too bad to curse
timon all villains that do stand by thee are pure
apemantus there is no leprosy but what thou speak'st
timon if i name thee
 i'll beat thee but i should infect my hands
apemantus i would my tongue could rot them off
timon away thou issue of a mangy dog
 choler does kill me that thou art alive
 i swound to see thee
apemantus would thou wouldst burst
timon away
 thou tedious rogue i am sorry i shall lose
