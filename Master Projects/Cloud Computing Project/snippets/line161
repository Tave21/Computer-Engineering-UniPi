 beat mine inhoop'd at odds i will to egypt
 and though i make this marriage for my peace
 i the east my pleasure lies

 o from italy
 ram thou thy fruitful tidings in mine ears
 that long time have been barren
messenger madam madam
cleopatra antonius deadif thou say so villain

 if thou so yield him there is gold and here
 my bluest veins to kiss a hand that kings
 have lipp'd and trembled kissing
messenger first madam he is well
cleopatra why there's more gold
 but sirrah mark we use
 to say the dead are well bring it to that
 the gold i give thee will i melt and pour
 down thy illuttering throat
messenger good madam hear me
cleopatra well go to i will
 but there's no goodness in thy face if antony
 be free and healthfulso tart a favour
 to trumpet such good tidings if not well
 thou shouldst come like a fury crown'd with snakes
 not like a formal man
messenger will't please you hear me
cleopatra i have a mind to strike thee ere thou speak'st
 yet if thou say antony lives is well
 or friends with caesar or not captive to him
 i'll set thee in a shower of gold and hail
 rich pearls upon thee
messenger madam he's well
cleopatra well said
messenger and friends with caesar
cleopatra thou'rt an honest man
messenger caesar and he are greater friends than ever
cleopatra make thee a fortune from me
messenger but yet madam
cleopatra i do not like but yet it does allay
 the good precedence fie upon but yet'
 but yet is as a gaoler to bring forth
 some monstrous malefactor prithee friend
 pour out the pack of matter to mine ear
 the good and bad together he's friends with caesar
 in state of health thou say'st and thou say'st free
messenger free madam no i made no such report
 he's bound unto octavia
cleopatra for what good turn
messenger for the best turn i the bed
cleopatra i am pale charmian
messenger madam he's married to octavia
cleopatra the most infectious pestilence upon thee
 strikes him down
messenger good madam patience
cleopatra what say you hence
 strikes him again
 horrible villain or i'll spurn thine eyes
 like balls before me i'll unhair thy head
 she hales him up and down
 thou shalt be whipp'd with wire and stew'd in brine
 smarting in lingering pickle
messenger gracious madam
 i that do bring the news made not the match
cleopatra say tis not so a province i will give thee
 and make thy fortunes proud the blow thou hadst
 shall make thy peace for moving me to rage
 and i will boot thee with what gift beside
 thy modesty can beg
messenger he's married madam
cleopatra rogue thou hast lived too long
 draws a knife
messenger nay then i'll run
 what mean you madam i have made no fault
 exit
charmian good madam keep yourself within yourself
 the man is innocent
cleopatra some innocents scape not the thunderbolt
 melt egypt into nile and kindly creatures
 turn all to serpents call the slave again
 though i am mad i will not bite him call
charmian he is afeard to come
cleopatra i will not hurt him
 exit charmian
 these hands do lack nobility that they strike
 a meaner than myself since i myself
 have given myself the cause
 reenter charmian and messenger
 come hither sir
 though it be honest it is never good
 to bring bad news give to a gracious message
 an host of tongues but let ill tidings tell
 themselves when they be felt
messenger i have done my duty
cleopatra is he married
 i cannot hate thee worser than i do
 if thou again say yes'
messenger he's married madam
cleopatra the gods confound thee dost thou hold there still
messenger should i lie madam
cleopatra o i would thou didst
 so half my egypt were submerged and made
 a cistern for scaled snakes go get thee hence
 hadst thou narcissus in thy face to me
 thou wouldst appear most ugly he is married
messenger i crave your highness pardon
cleopatra he is married
messenger take no offence that i would not offend you
 to punish me for what you make me do
 seems much unequal he's married to octavia
cleopatra o that his fault should make a knave of thee
 that art not what thou'rt sure of get thee hence
 the merchandise which thou hast brought from rome
 are all too dear for me lie they upon thy hand
 and be undone by em
 exit messenger
charmian good your highness patience
cleopatra in praising antony i have dispraised caesar
