 cried o and mounted found no opposition
 but what he look'd for should oppose and she
 should from encounter guard could i find out
 the woman's part in me for there's no motion
 that tends to vice in man but i affirm
 it is the woman's part be it lying note it
 the woman's flattering hers deceiving hers
 lust and rank thoughts hers hers revenges hers
 ambitions covetings change of prides disdain
 nice longing slanders mutability
 all faults that may be named nay that hell knows
 why hers in part or all but rather all
 for even to vice
 they are not constant but are changing still
 one vice but of a minute old for one
 not half so old as that i'll write against them
 detest them curse them yet tis greater skill
 in a true hate to pray they have their will
 the very devils cannot plague them better

act iii
scene i britain a hall in cymbeline's palace
 enter in state cymbeline queen cloten
 and lords at one door and at another
 caius lucius and attendants
cymbeline now say what would augustus caesar with us
caius lucius when julius caesar whose remembrance yet
 lives in men's eyes and will to ears and tongues
 be theme and hearing ever was in this britain
 and conquer'd it cassibelan thine uncle
 famous in caesar's praises no whit less
 than in his feats deserving itfor him
 and his succession granted rome a tribute
 yearly three thousand pounds which by thee lately
 is left untender'd
queen and to kill the marvel
 shall be so ever
cloten there be many caesars
 ere such another julius britain is
 a world by itself and we will nothing pay
 for wearing our own noses
queen that opportunity
 which then they had to take from s to resume
 we have again remember sir my liege
 the kings your ancestors together with
 the natural bravery of your isle which stands
 as neptune's park ribbed and paled in
 with rocks unscalable and roaring waters
 with sands that will not bear your enemies boats
 but suck them up to the topmast a kind of conquest
 caesar made here but made not here his brag
 of came and saw and overcame  with shame
 that first that ever touch'd himhe was carried
 from off our coast twice beaten and his shipping
 poor ignorant baubles upon our terrible seas
 like eggshells moved upon their surges crack'd
 as easily gainst our rocks for joy whereof
 the famed cassibelan who was once at point
 o giglot fortuneto master caesar's sword
 made lud's town with rejoicing fires bright
 and britons strut with courage
cloten come there's no more tribute to be paid our
 kingdom is stronger than it was at that time and
 as i said there is no moe such caesars other of
 them may have crook'd noses but to owe such
 straight arms none
cymbeline son let your mother end
cloten we have yet many among us can gripe as hard as
 cassibelan i do not say i am one but i have a
 hand why tribute why should we pay tribute if
 caesar can hide the sun from us with a blanket or
 put the moon in his pocket we will pay him tribute
 for light else sir no more tribute pray you now
cymbeline you must know
 till the injurious romans did extort
 this tribute from us we were free
 caesar's ambition
 which swell'd so much that it did almost stretch
 the sides o the world against all colour here
 did put the yoke upon s which to shake off
 becomes a warlike people whom we reckon
 ourselves to be
cloten 
 we do
lords 
cymbeline say then to caesar
 our ancestor was that mulmutius which
 ordain'd our laws whose use the sword of caesar
 hath too much mangled whose repair and franchise
 shall by the power we hold be our good deed
 though rome be therefore angry mulmutius made our laws
 who was the first of britain which did put
 his brows within a golden crown and call'd
 himself a king
caius lucius i am sorry cymbeline
 that i am to pronounce augustus caesar
 caesar that hath more kings his servants than
 thyself domestic officersthine enemy
 receive it from me then war and confusion
 in caesar's name pronounce i gainst thee look
 for fury not to be resisted thus defied
 i thank thee for myself
cymbeline thou art welcome caius
 thy caesar knighted me my youth i spent
 much under him of him i gather'd honour
 which he to seek of me again perforce
 behoves me keep at utterance i am perfect
 that the pannonians and dalmatians for
 their liberties are now in arms a precedent
 which not to read would show the britons cold
 so caesar shall not find them
caius lucius let proof speak
cloten his majesty bids you welcome make
 pastime with us a day or two or longer if
 you seek us afterwards in other terms you
 shall find us in our saltwater girdle if you
 beat us out of it it is yours if you fall in
 the adventure our crows shall fare the better
 for you and there's an end
caius lucius so sir
cymbeline i know your master's pleasure and he mine
 all the remain is welcome'

act iii
scene ii another room in the palace

pisanio how of adultery wherefore write you not
 what monster's her accuser leonatus
 o master what a strange infection
 is fall'n into thy ear what false italian
 as poisonoustongued as handed hath prevail'd
 on thy too ready hearing disloyal no
 she's punish'd for her truth and undergoes
 more goddesslike than wifelike such assaults
 as would take in some virtue o my master
 thy mind to her is now as low as were
 thy fortunes how that i should murder her
 upon the love and truth and vows which i
 have made to thy command i her her blood
 if it be so to do good service never
 let me be counted serviceable how look i
 that i should seem to lack humanity
 so much as this fact comes to
 reading
 do't the letter
 that i have sent her by her own command
 shall give thee opportunity o damn'd paper
 black as the ink that's on thee senseless bauble
 art thou a feodary for this act and look'st
 so virginlike without lo here she comes
 i am ignorant in what i am commanded
 enter imogen
imogen how now pisanio
pisanio madam here is a letter from my lord
imogen who thy lord that is my lord leonatus
 o learn'd indeed were that astronomer
 that knew the stars as i his characters
 he'ld lay the future open you good gods
 let what is here contain'd relish of love
 of my lord's health of his content yet not
 that we two are asunder let that grieve him
 some griefs are med'cinable that is one of them
 for it doth physic love of his content
 all but in that good wax thy leave blest be
 you bees that make these locks of counsel lovers
 and men in dangerous bonds pray not alike
 though forfeiters you cast in prison yet
 you clasp young cupid's tables good news gods
 reads
 justice and your father's wrath should he take me
 in his dominion could not be so cruel to me as
 you o the dearest of creatures would even renew me
 with your eyes take notice that i am in cambria
 at milfordhaven what your own love will out of
 this advise you follow so he wishes you all
 happiness that remains loyal to his vow and your
 increasing in love
 leonatus posthumus'
 o for a horse with wings hear'st thou pisanio
 he is at milfordhaven read and tell me
 how far tis thither if one of mean affairs
 may plod it in a week why may not i
 glide thither in a day then true pisanio
 who long'st like me to see thy lord who long'st
 let me batebut not like meyet long'st
 but in a fainter kindo not like me
 for mine's beyond beyondsay and speak thick
 love's counsellor should fill the bores of hearing
 to the smothering of the sensehow far it is
 to this same blessed milford and by the way
 tell me how wales was made so happy as
 to inherit such a haven but first of all
 how we may steal from hence and for the gap
 that we shall make in time from our hencegoing
 and our return to excuse but first how get hence
 why should excuse be born or e'er begot
 we'll talk of that hereafter prithee speak
 how many score of miles may we well ride
