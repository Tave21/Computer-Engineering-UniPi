lodovico is this the noble moor whom our full senate
 call all in all sufficient is this the nature
 whom passion could not shake whose solid virtue
 the shot of accident nor dart of chance
 could neither graze nor pierce
iago he is much changed
lodovico are his wits safe is he not light of brain
iago he's that he is i may not breathe my censure
 what he might be if what he might he is not
 i would to heaven he were
lodovico what strike his wife
iago faith that was not so well yet would i knew
 that stroke would prove the worst
lodovico is it his use
 or did the letters work upon his blood
 and newcreate this fault
iago alas alas
 it is not honesty in me to speak
 what i have seen and known you shall observe him
 and his own courses will denote him so
 that i may save my speech do but go after
 and mark how he continues
lodovico i am sorry that i am deceived in him
 exeunt
 othello
act iv
scene ii a room in the castle
 enter othello and emilia
othello you have seen nothing then
emilia nor ever heard nor ever did suspect
othello yes you have seen cassio and she together
emilia but then i saw no harm and then i heard
 each syllable that breath made up between them
othello what did they never whisper
emilia never my lord
othello nor send you out o the way
emilia never
othello to fetch her fan her gloves her mask nor nothing
emilia never my lord
othello that's strange
emilia i durst my lord to wager she is honest
 lay down my soul at stake if you think other
