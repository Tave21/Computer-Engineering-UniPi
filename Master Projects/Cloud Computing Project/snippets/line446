 violent and unruly go you to angelo answer his
 requiring with a plausible obedience agree with
 his demands to the point only refer yourself to
 this advantage first that your stay with him may
 not be long that the time may have all shadow and
 silence in it and the place answer to convenience

 allwe shall advise this wronged maid to stead up
 your appointment go in your place if the encounter
 acknowledge itself hereafter it may compel him to
 her recompense and here by this is your brother
 saved your honour untainted the poor mariana
 advantaged and the corrupt deputy scaled the maid

 think well to carry this as you may the doubleness
 of the benefit defends the deceit from reproof

 is herself in the tub

lucio go to kennel pompey go
 exeunt elbow pompey and officers
 what news friar of the duke
duke vincentio i know none can you tell me of any
lucio some say he is with the emperor of russia other
 some he is in rome but where is he think you
duke vincentio i know not where but wheresoever i wish him well
lucio it was a mad fantastical trick of him to steal from
 the state and usurp the beggary he was never born
 to lord angelo dukes it well in his absence he
 puts transgression to t
duke vincentio he does well in t
lucio a little more lenity to lechery would do no harm in
 him something too crabbed that way friar
duke vincentio it is too general a vice and severity must cure it
lucio yes in good sooth the vice is of a great kindred
 it is well allied but it is impossible to extirp
 it quite friar till eating and drinking be put
 down they say this angelo was not made by man and
 woman after this downright way of creation is it
 true think you
duke vincentio how should he be made then
lucio some report a seamaid spawned him some that he
 was begot between two stockfishes but it is
 certain that when he makes water his urine is
 congealed ice that i know to be true and he is a
 motion generative that's infallible
duke vincentio you are pleasant sir and speak apace
lucio why what a ruthless thing is this in him for the
 rebellion of a codpiece to take away the life of a
 man would the duke that is absent have done this
 ere he would have hanged a man for the getting a
 hundred bastards he would have paid for the nursing
 a thousand he had some feeling of the sport he
 knew the service and that instructed him to mercy
duke vincentio i never heard the absent duke much detected for
 women he was not inclined that way
lucio o sir you are deceived
duke vincentio tis not possible
lucio who not the duke yes your beggar of fifty and
 his use was to put a ducat in her clackdish the
 duke had crotchets in him he would be drunk too
 that let me inform you
duke vincentio you do him wrong surely
lucio sir i was an inward of his a shy fellow was the
 duke and i believe i know the cause of his
 withdrawing
duke vincentio what i prithee might be the cause
lucio no pardon tis a secret must be locked within the
 teeth and the lips but this i can let you
 understand the greater file of the subject held the
 duke to be wise
duke vincentio wise why no question but he was
lucio a very superficial ignorant unweighing fellow
duke vincentio either this is the envy in you folly or mistaking
 the very stream of his life and the business he hath
 helmed must upon a warranted need give him a better
 proclamation let him be but testimonied in his own
 bringingsforth and he shall appear to the
 envious a scholar a statesman and a soldier
 therefore you speak unskilfully or if your
 knowledge be more it is much darkened in your malice
lucio sir i know him and i love him
duke vincentio love talks with better knowledge and knowledge with
 dearer love
lucio come sir i know what i know
duke vincentio i can hardly believe that since you know not what
 you speak but if ever the duke return as our
 prayers are he may let me desire you to make your
 answer before him if it be honest you have spoke
 you have courage to maintain it i am bound to call
 upon you and i pray you your name
lucio sir my name is lucio well known to the duke
duke vincentio he shall know you better sir if i may live to
 report you
lucio i fear you not
duke vincentio o you hope the duke will return no more or you
