2chr2011 behold i say how they reward us to come to cast us out of thy possession which thou hast given us to inherit
2chr2012 o our god wilt thou not judge them for we have no might against this great company that cometh against us neither know we what to do but our eyes are upon thee
2chr2013 and all judah stood before the lord with their little ones their wives and their children
2chr2014 then upon jahaziel the son of zechariah the son of benaiah the son of jeiel the son of mattaniah a levite of the sons of asaph came the spirit of the lord in the midst of the congregation
2chr2015 and he said hearken ye all judah and ye inhabitants of jerusalem and thou king jehoshaphat thus saith the lord unto you be not afraid nor dismayed by reason of this great multitude for the battle is not yours but god's
2chr2016 to morrow go ye down against them behold they come up by the cliff of ziz and ye shall find them at the end of the brook before the wilderness of jeruel
2chr2017 ye shall not need to fight in this battle set yourselves stand ye still and see the salvation of the lord with you o judah and jerusalem fear not nor be dismayed to morrow go out against them for the lord will be with you
2chr2018 and jehoshaphat bowed his head with his face to the ground and all judah and the inhabitants of jerusalem fell before the lord worshipping the lord
2chr2019 and the levites of the children of the kohathites and of the children of the korhites stood up to praise the lord god of israel with a loud voice on high
2chr2020 and they rose early in the morning and went forth into the wilderness of tekoa and as they went forth jehoshaphat stood and said hear me o judah and ye inhabitants of jerusalem believe in the lord your god so shall ye be established believe his prophets so shall ye prosper
2chr2021 and when he had consulted with the people he appointed singers unto the lord and that should praise the beauty of holiness as they went out before the army and to say praise the lord for his mercy endureth for ever
2chr2022 and when they began to sing and to praise the lord set ambushments against the children of ammon moab and mount seir which were come against judah and they were smitten
2chr2023 for the children of ammon and moab stood up against the inhabitants of mount seir utterly to slay and destroy them and when they had made an end of the inhabitants of seir every one helped to destroy another
2chr2024 and when judah came toward the watch tower in the wilderness they looked unto the multitude and behold they were dead bodies fallen to the earth and none escaped
2chr2025 and when jehoshaphat and his people came to take away the spoil of them they found among them in abundance both riches with the dead bodies and precious jewels which they stripped off for themselves more than they could carry away and they were three days in gathering of the spoil it was so much
2chr2026 and on the fourth day they assembled themselves in the valley of berachah for there they blessed the lord therefore the name of the same place was called the valley of berachah unto this day
2chr2027 then they returned every man of judah and jerusalem and jehoshaphat in the forefront of them to go again to jerusalem with joy for the lord had made them to rejoice over their enemies
2chr2028 and they came to jerusalem with psalteries and harps and trumpets unto the house of the lord
2chr2029 and the fear of god was on all the kingdoms of those countries when they had heard that the lord fought against the enemies of israel
2chr2030 so the realm of jehoshaphat was quiet for his god gave him rest round about
2chr2031 and jehoshaphat reigned over judah he was thirty and five years old when he began to reign and he reigned twenty and five years in jerusalem and his mother's name was azubah the daughter of shilhi
2chr2032 and he walked in the way of asa his father and departed not from it doing that which was right in the sight of the lord
2chr2033 howbeit the high places were not taken away for as yet the people had not prepared their hearts unto the god of their fathers
2chr2034 now the rest of the acts of jehoshaphat first and last behold they are written in the book of jehu the son of hanani who is mentioned in the book of the kings of israel
2chr2035 and after this did jehoshaphat king of judah join himself with ahaziah king of israel who did very wickedly
2chr2036 and he joined himself with him to make ships to go to tarshish and they made the ships in eziongaber
2chr2037 then eliezer the son of dodavah of mareshah prophesied against jehoshaphat saying because thou hast joined thyself with ahaziah the lord hath broken thy works and the ships were broken that they were not able to go to tarshish
2chr211 now jehoshaphat slept with his fathers and was buried with his fathers in the city of david and jehoram his son reigned in his stead
2chr212 and he had brethren the sons of jehoshaphat azariah and jehiel and zechariah and azariah and michael and shephatiah all these were the sons of jehoshaphat king of israel
2chr213 and their father gave them great gifts of silver and of gold and of precious things with fenced cities in judah but the kingdom gave he to jehoram because he was the firstborn
2chr214 now when jehoram was risen up to the kingdom of his father he strengthened himself and slew all his brethren with the sword and divers also of the princes of israel
2chr215 jehoram was thirty and two years old when he began to reign and he reigned eight years in jerusalem
2chr216 and he walked in the way of the kings of israel like as did the house of ahab for he had the daughter of ahab to wife and he wrought that which was evil in the eyes of the lord
2chr217 howbeit the lord would not destroy the house of david because of the covenant that he had made with david and as he promised to give a light to him and to his sons for ever
2chr218 in his days the edomites revolted from under the dominion of judah and made themselves a king
2chr219 then jehoram went forth with his princes and all his chariots with him and he rose up by night and smote the edomites which compassed him in and the captains of the chariots
2chr2110 so the edomites revolted from under the hand of judah unto this day the same time also did libnah revolt from under his hand because he had forsaken the lord god of his fathers
2chr2111 moreover he made high places in the mountains of judah and caused the inhabitants of jerusalem to commit fornication and compelled judah thereto
2chr2112 and there came a writing to him from elijah the prophet saying thus saith the lord god of david thy father because thou hast not walked in the ways of jehoshaphat thy father nor in the ways of asa king of judah
2chr2113 but hast walked in the way of the kings of israel and hast made judah and the inhabitants of jerusalem to go a whoring like to the whoredoms of the house of ahab and also hast slain thy brethren of thy father's house which were better than thyself
2chr2114 behold with a great plague will the lord smite thy people and thy children and thy wives and all thy goods
2chr2115 and thou shalt have great sickness by disease of thy bowels until thy bowels fall out by reason of the sickness day by day
2chr2116 moreover the lord stirred up against jehoram the spirit of the philistines and of the arabians that were near the ethiopians
2chr2117 and they came up into judah and brake into it and carried away all the substance that was found in the king's house and his sons also and his wives so that there was never a son left him save jehoahaz the youngest of his sons
2chr2118 and after all this the lord smote him in his bowels with an incurable disease
2chr2119 and it came to pass that in process of time after the end of two years his bowels fell out by reason of his sickness so he died of sore diseases and his people made no burning for him like the burning of his fathers
2chr2120 thirty and two years old was he when he began to reign and he reigned in jerusalem eight years and departed without being desired howbeit they buried him in the city of david but not in the sepulchres of the kings
2chr221 and the inhabitants of jerusalem made ahaziah his youngest son king in his stead for the band of men that came with the arabians to the camp had slain all the eldest so ahaziah the son of jehoram king of judah reigned
2chr222 forty and two years old was ahaziah when he began to reign and he reigned one year in jerusalem his mother's name also was athaliah the daughter of omri
2chr223 he also walked in the ways of the house of ahab for his mother was his counsellor to do wickedly
2chr224 wherefore he did evil in the sight of the lord like the house of ahab for they were his counsellors after the death of his father to his destruction
2chr225 he walked also after their counsel and went with jehoram the son of ahab king of israel to war against hazael king of syria at ramothgilead and the syrians smote joram
2chr226 and he returned to be healed in jezreel because of the wounds which were given him at ramah when he fought with hazael king of syria and azariah the son of jehoram king of judah went down to see jehoram the son of ahab at jezreel because he was sick
2chr227 and the destruction of ahaziah was of god by coming to joram for when he was come he went out with jehoram against jehu the son of nimshi whom the lord had anointed to cut off the house of ahab
2chr228 and it came to pass that when jehu was executing judgment upon the house of ahab and found the princes of judah and the sons of the brethren of ahaziah that ministered to ahaziah he slew them
2chr229 and he sought ahaziah and they caught him for he was hid in samaria and brought him to jehu and when they had slain him they buried him because said they he is the son of jehoshaphat who sought the lord with all his heart so the house of ahaziah had no power to keep still the kingdom
2chr2210 but when athaliah the mother of ahaziah saw that her son was dead she arose and destroyed all the seed royal of the house of judah
2chr2211 but jehoshabeath the daughter of the king took joash the son of ahaziah and stole him from among the king's sons that were slain and put him and his nurse in a bedchamber so jehoshabeath the daughter of king jehoram the wife of jehoiada the priest for she was the sister of ahaziah hid him from athaliah so that she slew him not
2chr2212 and he was with them hid in the house of god six years and athaliah reigned over the land
2chr231 and in the seventh year jehoiada strengthened himself and took the captains of hundreds azariah the son of jeroham and ishmael the son of jehohanan and azariah the son of obed and maaseiah the son of adaiah and elishaphat the son of zichri into covenant with him
2chr232 and they went about in judah and gathered the levites out of all the cities of judah and the chief of the fathers of israel and they came to jerusalem
2chr233 and all the congregation made a covenant with the king in the house of god and he said unto them behold the king's son shall reign as the lord hath said of the sons of david
2chr234 this is the thing that ye shall do a third part of you entering on the sabbath of the priests and of the levites shall be porters of the doors
2chr235 and a third part shall be at the king's house and a third part at the gate of the foundation and all the people shall be in the courts of the house of the lord
2chr236 but let none come into the house of the lord save the priests and they that minister of the levites they shall go in for they are holy but all the people shall keep the watch of the lord
2chr237 and the levites shall compass the king round about every man with his weapons in his hand and whosoever else cometh into the house he shall be put to death but be ye with the king when he cometh in and when he goeth out
2chr238 so the levites and all judah did according to all things that jehoiada the priest had commanded and took every man his men that were to come in on the sabbath with them that were to go out on the sabbath for jehoiada the priest dismissed not the courses
2chr239 moreover jehoiada the priest delivered to the captains of hundreds spears and bucklers and shields that had been king david's which were in the house of god
2chr2310 and he set all the people every man having his weapon in his hand from the right side of the temple to the left side of the temple along by the altar and the temple by the king round about
2chr2311 then they brought out the king's son and put upon him the crown and gave him the testimony and made him king and jehoiada and his sons anointed him and said god save the king
2chr2312 now when athaliah heard the noise of the people running and praising the king she came to the people into the house of the lord
2chr2313 and she looked and behold the king stood at his pillar at the entering in and the princes and the trumpets by the king and all the people of the land rejoiced and sounded with trumpets also the singers with instruments of musick and such as taught to sing praise then athaliah rent her clothes and said treason treason
2chr2314 then jehoiada the priest brought out the captains of hundreds that were set over the host and said unto them have her forth of the ranges and whoso followeth her let him be slain with the sword for the priest said slay her not in the house of the lord
2chr2315 so they laid hands on her and when she was come to the entering of the horse gate by the king's house they slew her there
2chr2316 and jehoiada made a covenant between him and between all the people and between the king that they should be the lord's people
2chr2317 then all the people went to the house of baal and brake it down and brake his altars and his images in pieces and slew mattan the priest of baal before the altars
2chr2318 also jehoiada appointed the offices of the house of the lord by the hand of the priests the levites whom david had distributed in the house of the lord to offer the burnt offerings of the lord as it is written in the law of moses with rejoicing and with singing as it was ordained by david
2chr2319 and he set the porters at the gates of the house of the lord that none which was unclean in any thing should enter in
2chr2320 and he took the captains of hundreds and the nobles and the governors of the people and all the people of the land and brought down the king from the house of the lord and they came through the high gate into the king's house and set the king upon the throne of the kingdom
2chr2321 and all the people of the land rejoiced and the city was quiet after that they had slain athaliah with the sword
2chr241 joash was seven years old when he began to reign and he reigned forty years in jerusalem his mother's name also was zibiah of beersheba
2chr242 and joash did that which was right in the sight of the lord all the days of jehoiada the priest
2chr243 and jehoiada took for him two wives and he begat sons and daughters
2chr244 and it came to pass after this that joash was minded to repair the house of the lord
2chr245 and he gathered together the priests and the levites and said to them go out unto the cities of judah and gather of all israel money to repair the house of your god from year to year and see that ye hasten the matter howbeit the levites hastened it not
2chr246 and the king called for jehoiada the chief and said unto him why hast thou not required of the levites to bring in out of judah and out of jerusalem the collection according to the commandment of moses the servant of the lord and of the congregation of israel for the tabernacle of witness
2chr247 for the sons of athaliah that wicked woman had broken up the house of god and also all the dedicated things of the house of the lord did they bestow upon baalim
2chr248 and at the king's commandment they made a chest and set it without at the gate of the house of the lord
2chr249 and they made a proclamation through judah and jerusalem to bring in to the lord the collection that moses the servant of god laid upon israel in the wilderness
2chr2410 and all the princes and all the people rejoiced and brought in and cast into the chest until they had made an end
2chr2411 now it came to pass that at what time the chest was brought unto the king's office by the hand of the levites and when they saw that there was much money the king's scribe and the high priest's officer came and emptied the chest and took it and carried it to his place again thus they did day by day and gathered money in abundance
2chr2412 and the king and jehoiada gave it to such as did the work of the service of the house of the lord and hired masons and carpenters to repair the house of the lord and also such as wrought iron and brass to mend the house of the lord
2chr2413 so the workmen wrought and the work was perfected by them and they set the house of god in his state and strengthened it
2chr2414 and when they had finished it they brought the rest of the money before the king and jehoiada whereof were made vessels for the house of the lord even vessels to minister and to offer withal and spoons and vessels of gold and silver and they offered burnt offerings in the house of the lord continually all the days of jehoiada
2chr2415 but jehoiada waxed old and was full of days when he died an hundred and thirty years old was he when he died
2chr2416 and they buried him in the city of david among the kings because he had done good in israel both toward god and toward his house
2chr2417 now after the death of jehoiada came the princes of judah and made obeisance to the king then the king hearkened unto them
2chr2418 and they left the house of the lord god of their fathers and served groves and idols and wrath came upon judah and jerusalem for this their trespass
2chr2419 yet he sent prophets to them to bring them again unto the lord and they testified against them but they would not give ear
2chr2420 and the spirit of god came upon zechariah the son of jehoiada the priest which stood above the people and said unto them thus saith god why transgress ye the commandments of the lord that ye cannot prosper because ye have forsaken the lord he hath also forsaken you
2chr2421 and they conspired against him and stoned him with stones at the commandment of the king in the court of the house of the lord
2chr2422 thus joash the king remembered not the kindness which jehoiada his father had done to him but slew his son and when he died he said the lord look upon it and require it
2chr2423 and it came to pass at the end of the year that the host of syria came up against him and they came to judah and jerusalem and destroyed all the princes of the people from among the people and sent all the spoil of them unto the king of damascus
2chr2424 for the army of the syrians came with a small company of men and the lord delivered a very great host into their hand because they had forsaken the lord god of their fathers so they executed judgment against joash
2chr2425 and when they were departed from him for they left him in great diseases his own servants conspired against him for the blood of the sons of jehoiada the priest and slew him on his bed and he died and they buried him in the city of david but they buried him not in the sepulchres of the kings
2chr2426 and these are they that conspired against him zabad the son of shimeath an ammonitess and jehozabad the son of shimrith a moabitess
2chr2427 now concerning his sons and the greatness of the burdens laid upon him and the repairing of the house of god behold they are written in the story of the book of the kings and amaziah his son reigned in his stead
2chr251 amaziah was twenty and five years old when he began to reign and he reigned twenty and nine years in jerusalem and his mother's name was jehoaddan of jerusalem
2chr252 and he did that which was right in the sight of the lord but not with a perfect heart
2chr253 now it came to pass when the kingdom was established to him that he slew his servants that had killed the king his father
2chr254 but he slew not their children but did as it is written in the law in the book of moses where the lord commanded saying the fathers shall not die for the children neither shall the children die for the fathers but every man shall die for his own sin
2chr255 moreover amaziah gathered judah together and made them captains over thousands and captains over hundreds according to the houses of their fathers throughout all judah and benjamin and he numbered them from twenty years old and above and found them three hundred thousand choice men able to go forth to war that could handle spear and shield
2chr256 he hired also an hundred thousand mighty men of valour out of israel for an hundred talents of silver
2chr257 but there came a man of god to him saying o king let not the army of israel go with thee for the lord is not with israel to wit with all the children of ephraim
2chr258 but if thou wilt go do it be strong for the battle god shall make thee fall before the enemy for god hath power to help and to cast down
2chr259 and amaziah said to the man of god but what shall we do for the hundred talents which i have given to the army of israel and the man of god answered the lord is able to give thee much more than this
2chr2510 then amaziah separated them to wit the army that was come to him out of ephraim to go home again wherefore their anger was greatly kindled against judah and they returned home in great anger
2chr2511 and amaziah strengthened himself and led forth his people and went to the valley of salt and smote of the children of seir ten thousand
2chr2512 and other ten thousand left alive did the children of judah carry away captive and brought them unto the top of the rock and cast them down from the top of the rock that they all were broken in pieces
2chr2513 but the soldiers of the army which amaziah sent back that they should not go with him to battle fell upon the cities of judah from samaria even unto bethhoron and smote three thousand of them and took much spoil
2chr2514 now it came to pass after that amaziah was come from the slaughter of the edomites that he brought the gods of the children of seir and set them up to be his gods and bowed down himself before them and burned incense unto them
2chr2515 wherefore the anger of the lord was kindled against amaziah and he sent unto him a prophet which said unto him why hast thou sought after the gods of the people which could not deliver their own people out of thine hand
2chr2516 and it came to pass as he talked with him that the king said unto him art thou made of the king's counsel forbear why shouldest thou be smitten then the prophet forbare and said i know that god hath determined to destroy thee because thou hast done this and hast not hearkened unto my counsel
2chr2517 then amaziah king of judah took advice and sent to joash the son of jehoahaz the son of jehu king of israel saying come let us see one another in the face
2chr2518 and joash king of israel sent to amaziah king of judah saying the thistle that was in lebanon sent to the cedar that was in lebanon saying give thy daughter to my son to wife and there passed by a wild beast that was in lebanon and trode down the thistle
2chr2519 thou sayest lo thou hast smitten the edomites and thine heart lifteth thee up to boast abide now at home why shouldest thou meddle to thine hurt that thou shouldest fall even thou and judah with thee
2chr2520 but amaziah would not hear for it came of god that he might deliver them into the hand of their enemies because they sought after the gods of edom
2chr2521 so joash the king of israel went up and they saw one another in the face both he and amaziah king of judah at bethshemesh which belongeth to judah
2chr2522 and judah was put to the worse before israel and they fled every man to his tent
2chr2523 and joash the king of israel took amaziah king of judah the son of joash the son of jehoahaz at bethshemesh and brought him to jerusalem and brake down the wall of jerusalem from the gate of ephraim to the corner gate four hundred cubits
2chr2524 and he took all the gold and the silver and all the vessels that were found in the house of god with obededom and the treasures of the king's house the hostages also and returned to samaria
2chr2525 and amaziah the son of joash king of judah lived after the death of joash son of jehoahaz king of israel fifteen years
2chr2526 now the rest of the acts of amaziah first and last behold are they not written in the book of the kings of judah and israel
2chr2527 now after the time that amaziah did turn away from following the lord they made a conspiracy against him in jerusalem and he fled to lachish but they sent to lachish after him and slew him there
2chr2528 and they brought him upon horses and buried him with his fathers in the city of judah
2chr261 then all the people of judah took uzziah who was sixteen years old and made him king in the room of his father amaziah
2chr262 he built eloth and restored it to judah after that the king slept with his fathers
2chr263 sixteen years old was uzziah when he began to reign and he reigned fifty and two years in jerusalem his mother's name also was jecoliah of jerusalem
2chr264 and he did that which was right in the sight of the lord according to all that his father amaziah did
2chr265 and he sought god in the days of zechariah who had understanding in the visions of god and as long as he sought the lord god made him to prosper
2chr266 and he went forth and warred against the philistines and brake down the wall of gath and the wall of jabneh and the wall of ashdod and built cities about ashdod and among the philistines
2chr267 and god helped him against the philistines and against the arabians that dwelt in gurbaal and the mehunims
2chr268 and the ammonites gave gifts to uzziah and his name spread abroad even to the entering in of egypt for he strengthened himself exceedingly
2chr269 moreover uzziah built towers in jerusalem at the corner gate and at the valley gate and at the turning of the wall and fortified them
2chr2610 also he built towers in the desert and digged many wells for he had much cattle both in the low country and in the plains husbandmen also and vine dressers in the mountains and in carmel for he loved husbandry
2chr2611 moreover uzziah had an host of fighting men that went out to war by bands according to the number of their account by the hand of jeiel the scribe and maaseiah the ruler under the hand of hananiah one of the king's captains
2chr2612 the whole number of the chief of the fathers of the mighty men of valour were two thousand and six hundred
2chr2613 and under their hand was an army three hundred thousand and seven thousand and five hundred that made war with mighty power to help the king against the enemy
2chr2614 and uzziah prepared for them throughout all the host shields and spears and helmets and habergeons and bows and slings to cast stones
2chr2615 and he made in jerusalem engines invented by cunning men to be on the towers and upon the bulwarks to shoot arrows and great stones withal and his name spread far abroad for he was marvellously helped till he was strong
2chr2616 but when he was strong his heart was lifted up to his destruction for he transgressed against the lord his god and went into the temple of the lord to burn incense upon the altar of incense
2chr2617 and azariah the priest went in after him and with him fourscore priests of the lord that were valiant men
2chr2618 and they withstood uzziah the king and said unto him it appertaineth not unto thee uzziah to burn incense unto the lord but to the priests the sons of aaron that are consecrated to burn incense go out of the sanctuary for thou hast trespassed neither shall it be for thine honour from the lord god
2chr2619 then uzziah was wroth and had a censer in his hand to burn incense and while he was wroth with the priests the leprosy even rose up in his forehead before the priests in the house of the lord from beside the incense altar
2chr2620 and azariah the chief priest and all the priests looked upon him and behold he was leprous in his forehead and they thrust him out from thence yea himself hasted also to go out because the lord had smitten him
2chr2621 and uzziah the king was a leper unto the day of his death and dwelt in a several house being a leper for he was cut off from the house of the lord and jotham his son was over the king's house judging the people of the land
2chr2622 now the rest of the acts of uzziah first and last did isaiah the prophet the son of amoz write
2chr2623 so uzziah slept with his fathers and they buried him with his fathers in the field of the burial which belonged to the kings for they said he is a leper and jotham his son reigned in his stead
2chr271 jotham was twenty and five years old when he began to reign and he reigned sixteen years in jerusalem his mother's name also was jerushah the daughter of zadok
2chr272 and he did that which was right in the sight of the lord according to all that his father uzziah did howbeit he entered not into the temple of the lord and the people did yet corruptly
2chr273 he built the high gate of the house of the lord and on the wall of ophel he built much
2chr274 moreover he built cities in the mountains of judah and in the forests he built castles and towers
2chr275 he fought also with the king of the ammonites and prevailed against them and the children of ammon gave him the same year an hundred talents of silver and ten thousand measures of wheat and ten thousand of barley so much did the children of ammon pay unto him both the second year and the third
2chr276 so jotham became mighty because he prepared his ways before the lord his god
2chr277 now the rest of the acts of jotham and all his wars and his ways lo they are written in the book of the kings of israel and judah
2chr278 he was five and twenty years old when he began to reign and reigned sixteen years in jerusalem
2chr279 and jotham slept with his fathers and they buried him in the city of david and ahaz his son reigned in his stead
2chr281 ahaz was twenty years old when he began to reign and he reigned sixteen years in jerusalem but he did not that which was right in the sight of the lord like david his father
2chr282 for he walked in the ways of the kings of israel and made also molten images for baalim
2chr283 moreover he burnt incense in the valley of the son of hinnom and burnt his children in the fire after the abominations of the heathen whom the lord had cast out before the children of israel
2chr284 he sacrificed also and burnt incense in the high places and on the hills and under every green tree
2chr285 wherefore the lord his god delivered him into the hand of the king of syria and they smote him and carried away a great multitude of them captives and brought them to damascus and he was also delivered into the hand of the king of israel who smote him with a great slaughter
2chr286 for pekah the son of remaliah slew in judah an hundred and twenty thousand in one day which were all valiant men because they had forsaken the lord god of their fathers
2chr287 and zichri a mighty man of ephraim slew maaseiah the king's son and azrikam the governor of the house and elkanah that was next to the king
2chr288 and the children of israel carried away captive of their brethren two hundred thousand women sons and daughters and took also away much spoil from them and brought the spoil to samaria
2chr289 but a prophet of the lord was there whose name was oded and he went out before the host that came to samaria and said unto them behold because the lord god of your fathers was wroth with judah he hath delivered them into your hand and ye have slain them in a rage that reacheth up unto heaven
2chr2810 and now ye purpose to keep under the children of judah and jerusalem for bondmen and bondwomen unto you but are there not with you even with you sins against the lord your god
2chr2811 now hear me therefore and deliver the captives again which ye have taken captive of your brethren for the fierce wrath of the lord is upon you
2chr2812 then certain of the heads of the children of ephraim azariah the son of johanan berechiah the son of meshillemoth and jehizkiah the son of shallum and amasa the son of hadlai stood up against them that came from the war
2chr2813 and said unto them ye shall not bring in the captives hither for whereas we have offended against the lord already ye intend to add more to our sins and to our trespass for our trespass is great and there is fierce wrath against israel
2chr2814 so the armed men left the captives and the spoil before the princes and all the congregation
2chr2815 and the men which were expressed by name rose up and took the captives and with the spoil clothed all that were naked among them and arrayed them and shod them and gave them to eat and to drink and anointed them and carried all the feeble of them upon asses and brought them to jericho the city of palm trees to their brethren then they returned to samaria
2chr2816 at that time did king ahaz send unto the kings of assyria to help him
2chr2817 for again the edomites had come and smitten judah and carried away captives
2chr2818 the philistines also had invaded the cities of the low country and of the south of judah and had taken bethshemesh and ajalon and gederoth and shocho with the villages thereof and timnah with the villages thereof gimzo also and the villages thereof and they dwelt there
2chr2819 for the lord brought judah low because of ahaz king of israel for he made judah naked and transgressed sore against the lord
2chr2820 and tilgathpilneser king of assyria came unto him and distressed him but strengthened him not
2chr2821 for ahaz took away a portion out of the house of the lord and out of the house of the king and of the princes and gave it unto the king of assyria but he helped him not
2chr2822 and in the time of his distress did he trespass yet more against the lord this is that king ahaz
2chr2823 for he sacrificed unto the gods of damascus which smote him and he said because the gods of the kings of syria help them therefore will i sacrifice to them that they may help me but they were the ruin of him and of all israel
2chr2824 and ahaz gathered together the vessels of the house of god and cut in pieces the vessels of the house of god and shut up the doors of the house of the lord and he made him altars in every corner of jerusalem
2chr2825 and in every several city of judah he made high places to burn incense unto other gods and provoked to anger the lord god of his fathers
2chr2826 now the rest of his acts and of all his ways first and last behold they are written in the book of the kings of judah and israel
2chr2827 and ahaz slept with his fathers and they buried him in the city even in jerusalem but they brought him not into the sepulchres of the kings of israel and hezekiah his son reigned in his stead
2chr291 hezekiah began to reign when he was five and twenty years old and he reigned nine and twenty years in jerusalem and his mother's name was abijah the daughter of zechariah
2chr292 and he did that which was right in the sight of the lord according to all that david his father had done
2chr293 he in the first year of his reign in the first month opened the doors of the house of the lord and repaired them
2chr294 and he brought in the priests and the levites and gathered them together into the east street
2chr295 and said unto them hear me ye levites sanctify now yourselves and sanctify the house of the lord god of your fathers and carry forth the filthiness out of the holy place
2chr296 for our fathers have trespassed and done that which was evil in the eyes of the lord our god and have forsaken him and have turned away their faces from the habitation of the lord and turned their backs
