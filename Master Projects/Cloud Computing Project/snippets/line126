and when he heard of jesus he sent unto him the elders of the jews beseeching him that he would come and heal his servant
and when they came to jesus they besought him instantly saying that he was worthy for whom he should do this
for he loveth our nation and he hath built us a synagogue
then jesus went with them and when he was now not far from the house the centurion sent friends to him saying unto him lord trouble not thyself for i am not worthy that thou shouldest enter under my roof
wherefore neither thought i myself worthy to come unto thee but say in a word and my servant shall be healed
for i also am a man set under authority having under me soldiers and i say unto one go and he goeth and to another come and he cometh and to my servant do this and he doeth it
when jesus heard these things he marvelled at him and turned him about and said unto the people that followed him i say unto you i have not found so great faith no not in israel
and they that were sent returning to the house found the servant whole that had been sick
and it came to pass the day after that he went into a city called nain and many of his disciples went with him and much people
now when he came nigh to the gate of the city behold there was a dead man carried out the only son of his mother and she was a widow and much people of the city was with her
and when the lord saw her he had compassion on her and said unto her weep not
and he came and touched the bier and they that bare him stood still and he said young man i say unto thee arise
and he that was dead sat up and began to speak and he delivered him to his mother
and there came a fear on all and they glorified god saying that a great prophet is risen up among us and that god hath visited his people
and this rumour of him went forth throughout all judaea and throughout all the region round about
and the disciples of john shewed him of all these things
and john calling unto him two of his disciples sent them to jesus saying art thou he that should come or look we for another
when the men were come unto him they said john baptist hath sent us unto thee saying art thou he that should come or look we for another
and in that same hour he cured many of their infirmities and plagues and of evil spirits and unto many that were blind he gave sight
then jesus answering said unto them go your way and tell john what things ye have seen and heard how that the blind see the lame walk the lepers are cleansed the deaf hear the dead are raised to the poor the gospel is preached
and blessed is he whosoever shall not be offended in me
and when the messengers of john were departed he began to speak unto the people concerning john what went ye out into the wilderness for to see a reed shaken with the wind
but what went ye out for to see a man clothed in soft raiment behold they which are gorgeously apparelled and live delicately are in kings courts
but what went ye out for to see a prophet yea i say unto you and much more than a prophet
this is he of whom it is written behold i send my messenger before thy face which shall prepare thy way before thee
for i say unto you among those that are born of women there is not a greater prophet than john the baptist but he that is least in the kingdom of god is greater than he
and all the people that heard him and the publicans justified god being baptized with the baptism of john
but the pharisees and lawyers rejected the counsel of god against themselves being not baptized of him
and the lord said whereunto then shall i liken the men of this generation and to what are they like
they are like unto children sitting in the marketplace and calling one to another and saying we have piped unto you and ye have not danced we have mourned to you and ye have not wept
for john the baptist came neither eating bread nor drinking wine and ye say he hath a devil
the son of man is come eating and drinking and ye say behold a gluttonous man and a winebibber a friend of publicans and sinners
but wisdom is justified of all her children
and one of the pharisees desired him that he would eat with him and he went into the pharisee's house and sat down to meat
and behold a woman in the city which was a sinner when she knew that jesus sat at meat in the pharisee's house brought an alabaster box of ointment
and stood at his feet behind him weeping and began to wash his feet with tears and did wipe them with the hairs of her head and kissed his feet and anointed them with the ointment
now when the pharisee which had bidden him saw it he spake within himself saying this man if he were a prophet would have known who and what manner of woman this is that toucheth him for she is a sinner
and jesus answering said unto him simon i have somewhat to say unto thee and he saith master say on
there was a certain creditor which had two debtors the one owed five hundred pence and the other fifty
and when they had nothing to pay he frankly forgave them both tell me therefore which of them will love him most
simon answered and said i suppose that he to whom he forgave most and he said unto him thou hast rightly judged
and he turned to the woman and said unto simon seest thou this woman i entered into thine house thou gavest me no water for my feet but she hath washed my feet with tears and wiped them with the hairs of her head
thou gavest me no kiss but this woman since the time i came in hath not ceased to kiss my feet
my head with oil thou didst not anoint but this woman hath anointed my feet with ointment
wherefore i say unto thee her sins which are many are forgiven for she loved much but to whom little is forgiven the same loveth little
and he said unto her thy sins are forgiven
and they that sat at meat with him began to say within themselves who is this that forgiveth sins also
and he said to the woman thy faith hath saved thee go in peace
and it came to pass afterward that he went throughout every city and village preaching and shewing the glad tidings of the kingdom of god and the twelve were with him
and certain women which had been healed of evil spirits and infirmities mary called magdalene out of whom went seven devils
and joanna the wife of chuza herod's steward and susanna and many others which ministered unto him of their substance
and when much people were gathered together and were come to him out of every city he spake by a parable
a sower went out to sow his seed and as he sowed some fell by the way side and it was trodden down and the fowls of the air devoured it
and some fell upon a rock and as soon as it was sprung up it withered away because it lacked moisture
and some fell among thorns and the thorns sprang up with it and choked it
and other fell on good ground and sprang up and bare fruit an hundredfold and when he had said these things he cried he that hath ears to hear let him hear
and his disciples asked him saying what might this parable be
and he said unto you it is given to know the mysteries of the kingdom of god but to others in parables that seeing they might not see and hearing they might not understand
now the parable is this the seed is the word of god
those by the way side are they that hear then cometh the devil and taketh away the word out of their hearts lest they should believe and be saved
they on the rock are they which when they hear receive the word with joy and these have no root which for a while believe and in time of temptation fall away
and that which fell among thorns are they which when they have heard go forth and are choked with cares and riches and pleasures of this life and bring no fruit to perfection
but that on the good ground are they which in an honest and good heart having heard the word keep it and bring forth fruit with patience
no man when he hath lighted a candle covereth it with a vessel or putteth it under a bed but setteth it on a candlestick that they which enter in may see the light
for nothing is secret that shall not be made manifest neither any thing hid that shall not be known and come abroad
take heed therefore how ye hear for whosoever hath to him shall be given and whosoever hath not from him shall be taken even that which he seemeth to have
then came to him his mother and his brethren and could not come at him for the press
and it was told him by certain which said thy mother and thy brethren stand without desiring to see thee
and he answered and said unto them my mother and my brethren are these which hear the word of god and do it
now it came to pass on a certain day that he went into a ship with his disciples and he said unto them let us go over unto the other side of the lake and they launched forth
but as they sailed he fell asleep and there came down a storm of wind on the lake and they were filled with water and were in jeopardy
and they came to him and awoke him saying master master we perish then he arose and rebuked the wind and the raging of the water and they ceased and there was a calm
and he said unto them where is your faith and they being afraid wondered saying one to another what manner of man is this for he commandeth even the winds and water and they obey him
and they arrived at the country of the gadarenes which is over against galilee
and when he went forth to land there met him out of the city a certain man which had devils long time and ware no clothes neither abode in any house but in the tombs
when he saw jesus he cried out and fell down before him and with a loud voice said what have i to do with thee jesus thou son of god most high i beseech thee torment me not
for he had commanded the unclean spirit to come out of the man for oftentimes it had caught him and he was kept bound with chains and in fetters and he brake the bands and was driven of the devil into the wilderness
and jesus asked him saying what is thy name and he said legion because many devils were entered into him
and they besought him that he would not command them to go out into the deep
and there was there an herd of many swine feeding on the mountain and they besought him that he would suffer them to enter into them and he suffered them
then went the devils out of the man and entered into the swine and the herd ran violently down a steep place into the lake and were choked
when they that fed them saw what was done they fled and went and told it in the city and in the country
then they went out to see what was done and came to jesus and found the man out of whom the devils were departed sitting at the feet of jesus clothed and in his right mind and they were afraid
they also which saw it told them by what means he that was possessed of the devils was healed
then the whole multitude of the country of the gadarenes round about besought him to depart from them for they were taken with great fear and he went up into the ship and returned back again
now the man out of whom the devils were departed besought him that he might be with him but jesus sent him away saying
return to thine own house and shew how great things god hath done unto thee and he went his way and published throughout the whole city how great things jesus had done unto him
and it came to pass that when jesus was returned the people gladly received him for they were all waiting for him
and behold there came a man named jairus and he was a ruler of the synagogue and he fell down at jesus feet and besought him that he would come into his house
for he had one only daughter about twelve years of age and she lay a dying but as he went the people thronged him
and a woman having an issue of blood twelve years which had spent all her living upon physicians neither could be healed of any
came behind him and touched the border of his garment and immediately her issue of blood stanched
and jesus said who touched me when all denied peter and they that were with him said master the multitude throng thee and press thee and sayest thou who touched me
and jesus said somebody hath touched me for i perceive that virtue is gone out of me
and when the woman saw that she was not hid she came trembling and falling down before him she declared unto him before all the people for what cause she had touched him and how she was healed immediately
and he said unto her daughter be of good comfort thy faith hath made thee whole go in peace
while he yet spake there cometh one from the ruler of the synagogue's house saying to him thy daughter is dead trouble not the master
but when jesus heard it he answered him saying fear not believe only and she shall be made whole
and when he came into the house he suffered no man to go in save peter and james and john and the father and the mother of the maiden
and all wept and bewailed her but he said weep not she is not dead but sleepeth
and they laughed him to scorn knowing that she was dead
and he put them all out and took her by the hand and called saying maid arise
and her spirit came again and she arose straightway and he commanded to give her meat
and her parents were astonished but he charged them that they should tell no man what was done
then he called his twelve disciples together and gave them power and authority over all devils and to cure diseases
and he sent them to preach the kingdom of god and to heal the sick
and he said unto them take nothing for your journey neither staves nor scrip neither bread neither money neither have two coats apiece
and whatsoever house ye enter into there abide and thence depart
and whosoever will not receive you when ye go out of that city shake off the very dust from your feet for a testimony against them
and they departed and went through the towns preaching the gospel and healing every where
now herod the tetrarch heard of all that was done by him and he was perplexed because that it was said of some that john was risen from the dead
and of some that elias had appeared and of others that one of the old prophets was risen again
and herod said john have i beheaded but who is this of whom i hear such things and he desired to see him
and the apostles when they were returned told him all that they had done and he took them and went aside privately into a desert place belonging to the city called bethsaida
and the people when they knew it followed him and he received them and spake unto them of the kingdom of god and healed them that had need of healing
and when the day began to wear away then came the twelve and said unto him send the multitude away that they may go into the towns and country round about and lodge and get victuals for we are here in a desert place
but he said unto them give ye them to eat and they said we have no more but five loaves and two fishes except we should go and buy meat for all this people
for they were about five thousand men and he said to his disciples make them sit down by fifties in a company
and they did so and made them all sit down
then he took the five loaves and the two fishes and looking up to heaven he blessed them and brake and gave to the disciples to set before the multitude
and they did eat and were all filled and there was taken up of fragments that remained to them twelve baskets
and it came to pass as he was alone praying his disciples were with him and he asked them saying whom say the people that i am
they answering said john the baptist but some say elias and others say that one of the old prophets is risen again
he said unto them but whom say ye that i am peter answering said the christ of god
and he straitly charged them and commanded them to tell no man that thing
saying the son of man must suffer many things and be rejected of the elders and chief priests and scribes and be slain and be raised the third day
and he said to them all if any man will come after me let him deny himself and take up his cross daily and follow me
for whosoever will save his life shall lose it but whosoever will lose his life for my sake the same shall save it
for what is a man advantaged if he gain the whole world and lose himself or be cast away
for whosoever shall be ashamed of me and of my words of him shall the son of man be ashamed when he shall come in his own glory and in his father's and of the holy angels
but i tell you of a truth there be some standing here which shall not taste of death till they see the kingdom of god
and it came to pass about an eight days after these sayings he took peter and john and james and went up into a mountain to pray
and as he prayed the fashion of his countenance was altered and his raiment was white and glistering
and behold there talked with him two men which were moses and elias
who appeared in glory and spake of his decease which he should accomplish at jerusalem
but peter and they that were with him were heavy with sleep and when they were awake they saw his glory and the two men that stood with him
and it came to pass as they departed from him peter said unto jesus master it is good for us to be here and let us make three tabernacles one for thee and one for moses and one for elias not knowing what he said
while he thus spake there came a cloud and overshadowed them and they feared as they entered into the cloud
and there came a voice out of the cloud saying this is my beloved son hear him
and when the voice was past jesus was found alone and they kept it close and told no man in those days any of those things which they had seen
and it came to pass that on the next day when they were come down from the hill much people met him
and behold a man of the company cried out saying master i beseech thee look upon my son for he is mine only child
and lo a spirit taketh him and he suddenly crieth out and it teareth him that he foameth again and bruising him hardly departeth from him
and i besought thy disciples to cast him out and they could not
and jesus answering said o faithless and perverse generation how long shall i be with you and suffer you bring thy son hither
and as he was yet a coming the devil threw him down and tare him and jesus rebuked the unclean spirit and healed the child and delivered him again to his father
and they were all amazed at the mighty power of god but while they wondered every one at all things which jesus did he said unto his disciples
let these sayings sink down into your ears for the son of man shall be delivered into the hands of men
but they understood not this saying and it was hid from them that they perceived it not and they feared to ask him of that saying
then there arose a reasoning among them which of them should be greatest
and jesus perceiving the thought of their heart took a child and set him by him
and said unto them whosoever shall receive this child in my name receiveth me and whosoever shall receive me receiveth him that sent me for he that is least among you all the same shall be great
and john answered and said master we saw one casting out devils in thy name and we forbad him because he followeth not with us
and jesus said unto him forbid him not for he that is not against us is for us
and it came to pass when the time was come that he should be received up he stedfastly set his face to go to jerusalem
and sent messengers before his face and they went and entered into a village of the samaritans to make ready for him
and they did not receive him because his face was as though he would go to jerusalem
and when his disciples james and john saw this they said lord wilt thou that we command fire to come down from heaven and consume them even as elias did
but he turned and rebuked them and said ye know not what manner of spirit ye are of
for the son of man is not come to destroy men's lives but to save them and they went to another village
and it came to pass that as they went in the way a certain man said unto him lord i will follow thee whithersoever thou goest
and jesus said unto him foxes have holes and birds of the air have nests but the son of man hath not where to lay his head
and he said unto another follow me but he said lord suffer me first to go and bury my father
jesus said unto him let the dead bury their dead but go thou and preach the kingdom of god
and another also said lord i will follow thee but let me first go bid them farewell which are at home at my house
and jesus said unto him no man having put his hand to the plough and looking back is fit for the kingdom of god
after these things the lord appointed other seventy also and sent them two and two before his face into every city and place whither he himself would come
therefore said he unto them the harvest truly is great but the labourers are few pray ye therefore the lord of the harvest that he would send forth labourers into his harvest
go your ways behold i send you forth as lambs among wolves
carry neither purse nor scrip nor shoes and salute no man by the way
and into whatsoever house ye enter first say peace be to this house
and if the son of peace be there your peace shall rest upon it if not it shall turn to you again
and in the same house remain eating and drinking such things as they give for the labourer is worthy of his hire go not from house to house
and into whatsoever city ye enter and they receive you eat such things as are set before you
and heal the sick that are therein and say unto them the kingdom of god is come nigh unto you
but into whatsoever city ye enter and they receive you not go your ways out into the streets of the same and say
even the very dust of your city which cleaveth on us we do wipe off against you notwithstanding be ye sure of this that the kingdom of god is come nigh unto you
but i say unto you that it shall be more tolerable in that day for sodom than for that city
woe unto thee chorazin woe unto thee bethsaida for if the mighty works had been done in tyre and sidon which have been done in you they had a great while ago repented sitting in sackcloth and ashes
but it shall be more tolerable for tyre and sidon at the judgment than for you
and thou capernaum which art exalted to heaven shalt be thrust down to hell
he that heareth you heareth me and he that despiseth you despiseth me and he that despiseth me despiseth him that sent me
and the seventy returned again with joy saying lord even the devils are subject unto us through thy name
and he said unto them i beheld satan as lightning fall from heaven
behold i give unto you power to tread on serpents and scorpions and over all the power of the enemy and nothing shall by any means hurt you
notwithstanding in this rejoice not that the spirits are subject unto you but rather rejoice because your names are written in heaven
in that hour jesus rejoiced in spirit and said i thank thee o father lord of heaven and earth that thou hast hid these things from the wise and prudent and hast revealed them unto babes even so father for so it seemed good in thy sight
all things are delivered to me of my father and no man knoweth who the son is but the father and who the father is but the son and he to whom the son will reveal him
and he turned him unto his disciples and said privately blessed are the eyes which see the things that ye see
for i tell you that many prophets and kings have desired to see those things which ye see and have not seen them and to hear those things which ye hear and have not heard them
and behold a certain lawyer stood up and tempted him saying master what shall i do to inherit eternal life
he said unto him what is written in the law how readest thou
and he answering said thou shalt love the lord thy god with all thy heart and with all thy soul and with all thy strength and with all thy mind and thy neighbour as thyself
and he said unto him thou hast answered right this do and thou shalt live
but he willing to justify himself said unto jesus and who is my neighbour
and jesus answering said a certain man went down from jerusalem to jericho and fell among thieves which stripped him of his raiment and wounded him and departed leaving him half dead
and by chance there came down a certain priest that way and when he saw him he passed by on the other side
and likewise a levite when he was at the place came and looked on him and passed by on the other side
but a certain samaritan as he journeyed came where he was and when he saw him he had compassion on him
and went to him and bound up his wounds pouring in oil and wine and set him on his own beast and brought him to an inn and took care of him
