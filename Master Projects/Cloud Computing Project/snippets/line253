 the thane of cawdor began a dismal conflict
 till that bellona's bridegroom lapp'd in proof
 confronted him with selfcomparisons
 point against point rebellious arm gainst arm
 curbing his lavish spirit and to conclude
 the victory fell on us
duncan great happiness
ross that now
 sweno the norways king craves composition
 nor would we deign him burial of his men
 till he disbursed at saint colme's inch
 ten thousand dollars to our general use
duncan no more that thane of cawdor shall deceive
 our bosom interest go pronounce his present death
 and with his former title greet macbeth
ross i'll see it done
duncan what he hath lost noble macbeth hath won

 macbeth
act i
scene iii a heath near forres
 thunder enter the three witches
first witch where hast thou been sister
second witch killing swine
third witch sister where thou
first witch a sailor's wife had chestnuts in her lap
 and munch'd and munch'd and munch'd
 give me quoth i
 aroint thee witch the rumpfed ronyon cries
 her husband's to aleppo gone master o the tiger
 but in a sieve i'll thither sail
 and like a rat without a tail
 i'll do i'll do and i'll do
second witch i'll give thee a wind
first witch thou'rt kind
third witch and i another
first witch i myself have all the other
 and the very ports they blow
 all the quarters that they know
 i the shipman's card
 i will drain him dry as hay
 sleep shall neither night nor day
 hang upon his penthouse lid
 he shall live a man forbid
 weary se'nnights nine times nine
 shall he dwindle peak and pine
 though his bark cannot be lost
 yet it shall be tempesttost
 look what i have
second witch show me show me
first witch here i have a pilot's thumb
 wreck'd as homeward he did come
 drum within
third witch a drum a drum
 macbeth doth come
all the weird sisters hand in hand
 posters of the sea and land
 thus do go about about
 thrice to thine and thrice to mine
 and thrice again to make up nine
 peace the charm's wound up
 enter macbeth and banquo
macbeth so foul and fair a day i have not seen
banquo how far is't call'd to forres what are these
 so wither'd and so wild in their attire
 that look not like the inhabitants o the earth
 and yet are on't live you or are you aught
 that man may question you seem to understand me
 by each at once her chappy finger laying
 upon her skinny lips you should be women
 and yet your beards forbid me to interpret
 that you are so
macbeth speak if you can what are you
first witch all hail macbeth hail to thee thane of glamis
second witch all hail macbeth hail to thee thane of cawdor
third witch all hail macbeth thou shalt be king hereafter
banquo good sir why do you start and seem to fear
 things that do sound so fair i the name of truth
 are ye fantastical or that indeed
 which outwardly ye show my noble partner
 you greet with present grace and great prediction
 of noble having and of royal hope
 that he seems rapt withal to me you speak not
 if you can look into the seeds of time
 and say which grain will grow and which will not
 speak then to me who neither beg nor fear
 your favours nor your hate
first witch hail
second witch hail
third witch hail
first witch lesser than macbeth and greater
second witch not so happy yet much happier
third witch thou shalt get kings though thou be none
 so all hail macbeth and banquo
first witch banquo and macbeth all hail
macbeth stay you imperfect speakers tell me more
 by sinel's death i know i am thane of glamis
 but how of cawdor the thane of cawdor lives
 a prosperous gentleman and to be king
 stands not within the prospect of belief
 no more than to be cawdor say from whence
 you owe this strange intelligence or why
 upon this blasted heath you stop our way
 with such prophetic greeting speak i charge you
 witches vanish
banquo the earth hath bubbles as the water has
 and these are of them whither are they vanish'd
macbeth into the air and what seem'd corporal melted
 as breath into the wind would they had stay'd
banquo were such things here as we do speak about
 or have we eaten on the insane root
 that takes the reason prisoner
macbeth your children shall be kings
banquo you shall be king
macbeth and thane of cawdor too went it not so
banquo to the selfsame tune and words who's here
 enter ross and angus
ross the king hath happily received macbeth
 the news of thy success and when he reads
 thy personal venture in the rebels fight
 his wonders and his praises do contend
 which should be thine or his silenced with that
 in viewing o'er the rest o the selfsame day
 he finds thee in the stout norweyan ranks
 nothing afeard of what thyself didst make
 strange images of death as thick as hail
 came post with post and every one did bear
 thy praises in his kingdom's great defence
 and pour'd them down before him
angus we are sent
 to give thee from our royal master thanks
 only to herald thee into his sight
 not pay thee
ross and for an earnest of a greater honour
 he bade me from him call thee thane of cawdor
 in which addition hail most worthy thane
 for it is thine
banquo what can the devil speak true
macbeth the thane of cawdor lives why do you dress me
 in borrow'd robes
angus who was the thane lives yet
 but under heavy judgment bears that life
 which he deserves to lose whether he was combined
 with those of norway or did line the rebel
 with hidden help and vantage or that with both
 he labour'd in his country's wreck i know not
 but treasons capital confess'd and proved
 have overthrown him
macbeth aside glamis and thane of cawdor
 the greatest is behind
 to ross and angus
 thanks for your pains
 to banquo
 do you not hope your children shall be kings
 when those that gave the thane of cawdor to me
 promised no less to them
banquo that trusted home
 might yet enkindle you unto the crown
 besides the thane of cawdor but tis strange
 and oftentimes to win us to our harm
 the instruments of darkness tell us truths
 win us with honest trifles to betray's
 in deepest consequence
 cousins a word i pray you
macbeth aside two truths are told
 as happy prologues to the swelling act
 of the imperial themei thank you gentlemen
 aside this supernatural soliciting
 cannot be ill cannot be good if ill
 why hath it given me earnest of success
 commencing in a truth i am thane of cawdor
 if good why do i yield to that suggestion
 whose horrid image doth unfix my hair
 and make my seated heart knock at my ribs
 against the use of nature present fears
 are less than horrible imaginings
 my thought whose murder yet is but fantastical
 shakes so my single state of man that function
 is smother'd in surmise and nothing is
 but what is not
banquo look how our partner's rapt
macbeth aside if chance will have me king why chance may crown me
 without my stir
banquo new horrors come upon him
 like our strange garments cleave not to their mould
 but with the aid of use
macbeth aside come what come may
 time and the hour runs through the roughest day
banquo worthy macbeth we stay upon your leisure
macbeth give me your favour my dull brain was wrought
 with things forgotten kind gentlemen your pains
 are register'd where every day i turn
 the leaf to read them let us toward the king
 think upon what hath chanced and at more time
 the interim having weigh'd it let us speak
 our free hearts each to other
banquo very gladly
macbeth till then enough come friends
 exeunt
 macbeth
