for with the heart man believeth unto righteousness and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation
for the scripture saith whosoever believeth on him shall not be ashamed
for there is no difference between the jew and the greek for the same lord over all is rich unto all that call upon him
for whosoever shall call upon the name of the lord shall be saved
how then shall they call on him in whom they have not believed and how shall they believe in him of whom they have not heard and how shall they hear without a preacher
and how shall they preach except they be sent as it is written how beautiful are the feet of them that preach the gospel of peace and bring glad tidings of good things
but they have not all obeyed the gospel for esaias saith lord who hath believed our report
so then faith cometh by hearing and hearing by the word of god
but i say have they not heard yes verily their sound went into all the earth and their words unto the ends of the world
but i say did not israel know first moses saith i will provoke you to jealousy by them that are no people and by a foolish nation i will anger you
but esaias is very bold and saith i was found of them that sought me not i was made manifest unto them that asked not after me
but to israel he saith all day long i have stretched forth my hands unto a disobedient and gainsaying people
i say then hath god cast away his people god forbid for i also am an israelite of the seed of abraham of the tribe of benjamin
god hath not cast away his people which he foreknew wot ye not what the scripture saith of elias how he maketh intercession to god against israel saying
lord they have killed thy prophets and digged down thine altars and i am left alone and they seek my life
but what saith the answer of god unto him i have reserved to myself seven thousand men who have not bowed the knee to the image of baal
even so then at this present time also there is a remnant according to the election of grace
and if by grace then is it no more of works otherwise grace is no more grace but if it be of works then is it no more grace otherwise work is no more work
what then israel hath not obtained that which he seeketh for but the election hath obtained it and the rest were blinded
according as it is written god hath given them the spirit of slumber eyes that they should not see and ears that they should not hear unto this day
and david saith let their table be made a snare and a trap and a stumblingblock and a recompence unto them
let their eyes be darkened that they may not see and bow down their back alway
i say then have they stumbled that they should fall god forbid but rather through their fall salvation is come unto the gentiles for to provoke them to jealousy
now if the fall of them be the riches of the world and the diminishing of them the riches of the gentiles how much more their fulness
for i speak to you gentiles inasmuch as i am the apostle of the gentiles i magnify mine office
if by any means i may provoke to emulation them which are my flesh and might save some of them
for if the casting away of them be the reconciling of the world what shall the receiving of them be but life from the dead
for if the firstfruit be holy the lump is also holy and if the root be holy so are the branches
and if some of the branches be broken off and thou being a wild olive tree wert graffed in among them and with them partakest of the root and fatness of the olive tree
boast not against the branches but if thou boast thou bearest not the root but the root thee
thou wilt say then the branches were broken off that i might be graffed in
well because of unbelief they were broken off and thou standest by faith be not highminded but fear
for if god spared not the natural branches take heed lest he also spare not thee
behold therefore the goodness and severity of god on them which fell severity but toward thee goodness if thou continue in his goodness otherwise thou also shalt be cut off
and they also if they abide not still in unbelief shall be graffed in for god is able to graff them in again
for if thou wert cut out of the olive tree which is wild by nature and wert graffed contrary to nature into a good olive tree how much more shall these which be the natural branches be graffed into their own olive tree
for i would not brethren that ye should be ignorant of this mystery lest ye should be wise in your own conceits that blindness in part is happened to israel until the fulness of the gentiles be come in
and so all israel shall be saved as it is written there shall come out of sion the deliverer and shall turn away ungodliness from jacob
for this is my covenant unto them when i shall take away their sins
as concerning the gospel they are enemies for your sakes but as touching the election they are beloved for the fathers sakes
for the gifts and calling of god are without repentance
for as ye in times past have not believed god yet have now obtained mercy through their unbelief
even so have these also now not believed that through your mercy they also may obtain mercy
for god hath concluded them all in unbelief that he might have mercy upon all
o the depth of the riches both of the wisdom and knowledge of god how unsearchable are his judgments and his ways past finding out
for who hath known the mind of the lord or who hath been his counsellor
or who hath first given to him and it shall be recompensed unto him again
for of him and through him and to him are all things to whom be glory for ever amen
i beseech you therefore brethren by the mercies of god that ye present your bodies a living sacrifice holy acceptable unto god which is your reasonable service
and be not conformed to this world but be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind that ye may prove what is that good and acceptable and perfect will of god
for i say through the grace given unto me to every man that is among you not to think of himself more highly than he ought to think but to think soberly according as god hath dealt to every man the measure of faith
for as we have many members in one body and all members have not the same office
so we being many are one body in christ and every one members one of another
having then gifts differing according to the grace that is given to us whether prophecy let us prophesy according to the proportion of faith
or ministry let us wait on our ministering or he that teacheth on teaching
or he that exhorteth on exhortation he that giveth let him do it with simplicity he that ruleth with diligence he that sheweth mercy with cheerfulness
let love be without dissimulation abhor that which is evil cleave to that which is good
be kindly affectioned one to another with brotherly love in honour preferring one another
not slothful in business fervent in spirit serving the lord
rejoicing in hope patient in tribulation continuing instant in prayer
distributing to the necessity of saints given to hospitality
bless them which persecute you bless and curse not
rejoice with them that do rejoice and weep with them that weep
be of the same mind one toward another mind not high things but condescend to men of low estate be not wise in your own conceits
recompense to no man evil for evil provide things honest in the sight of all men
if it be possible as much as lieth in you live peaceably with all men
dearly beloved avenge not yourselves but rather give place unto wrath for it is written vengeance is mine i will repay saith the lord
therefore if thine enemy hunger feed him if he thirst give him drink for in so doing thou shalt heap coals of fire on his head
be not overcome of evil but overcome evil with good
let every soul be subject unto the higher powers for there is no power but of god the powers that be are ordained of god
whosoever therefore resisteth the power resisteth the ordinance of god and they that resist shall receive to themselves damnation
for rulers are not a terror to good works but to the evil wilt thou then not be afraid of the power do that which is good and thou shalt have praise of the same
for he is the minister of god to thee for good but if thou do that which is evil be afraid for he beareth not the sword in vain for he is the minister of god a revenger to execute wrath upon him that doeth evil
wherefore ye must needs be subject not only for wrath but also for conscience sake
for for this cause pay ye tribute also for they are god's ministers attending continually upon this very thing
render therefore to all their dues tribute to whom tribute is due custom to whom custom fear to whom fear honour to whom honour
owe no man any thing but to love one another for he that loveth another hath fulfilled the law
for this thou shalt not commit adultery thou shalt not kill thou shalt not steal thou shalt not bear false witness thou shalt not covet and if there be any other commandment it is briefly comprehended in this saying namely thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself
love worketh no ill to his neighbour therefore love is the fulfilling of the law
and that knowing the time that now it is high time to awake out of sleep for now is our salvation nearer than when we believed
the night is far spent the day is at hand let us therefore cast off the works of darkness and let us put on the armour of light
let us walk honestly as in the day not in rioting and drunkenness not in chambering and wantonness not in strife and envying
but put ye on the lord jesus christ and make not provision for the flesh to fulfil the lusts thereof
him that is weak in the faith receive ye but not to doubtful disputations
for one believeth that he may eat all things another who is weak eateth herbs
let not him that eateth despise him that eateth not and let not him which eateth not judge him that eateth for god hath received him
who art thou that judgest another man's servant to his own master he standeth or falleth yea he shall be holden up for god is able to make him stand
one man esteemeth one day above another another esteemeth every day alike let every man be fully persuaded in his own mind
he that regardeth the day regardeth it unto the lord and he that regardeth not the day to the lord he doth not regard it he that eateth eateth to the lord for he giveth god thanks and he that eateth not to the lord he eateth not and giveth god thanks
for none of us liveth to himself and no man dieth to himself
for whether we live we live unto the lord and whether we die we die unto the lord whether we live therefore or die we are the lord's
for to this end christ both died and rose and revived that he might be lord both of the dead and living
but why dost thou judge thy brother or why dost thou set at nought thy brother for we shall all stand before the judgment seat of christ
for it is written as i live saith the lord every knee shall bow to me and every tongue shall confess to god
so then every one of us shall give account of himself to god
let us not therefore judge one another any more but judge this rather that no man put a stumblingblock or an occasion to fall in his brother's way
i know and am persuaded by the lord jesus that there is nothing unclean of itself but to him that esteemeth any thing to be unclean to him it is unclean
but if thy brother be grieved with thy meat now walkest thou not charitably destroy not him with thy meat for whom christ died
let not then your good be evil spoken of
for the kingdom of god is not meat and drink but righteousness and peace and joy in the holy ghost
for he that in these things serveth christ is acceptable to god and approved of men
let us therefore follow after the things which make for peace and things wherewith one may edify another
for meat destroy not the work of god all things indeed are pure but it is evil for that man who eateth with offence
it is good neither to eat flesh nor to drink wine nor any thing whereby thy brother stumbleth or is offended or is made weak
hast thou faith have it to thyself before god happy is he that condemneth not himself in that thing which he alloweth
and he that doubteth is damned if he eat because he eateth not of faith for whatsoever is not of faith is sin
we then that are strong ought to bear the infirmities of the weak and not to please ourselves
let every one of us please his neighbour for his good to edification
for even christ pleased not himself but as it is written the reproaches of them that reproached thee fell on me
for whatsoever things were written aforetime were written for our learning that we through patience and comfort of the scriptures might have hope
now the god of patience and consolation grant you to be likeminded one toward another according to christ jesus
that ye may with one mind and one mouth glorify god even the father of our lord jesus christ
wherefore receive ye one another as christ also received us to the glory of god
now i say that jesus christ was a minister of the circumcision for the truth of god to confirm the promises made unto the fathers
and that the gentiles might glorify god for his mercy as it is written for this cause i will confess to thee among the gentiles and sing unto thy name
and again he saith rejoice ye gentiles with his people
and again praise the lord all ye gentiles and laud him all ye people
and again esaias saith there shall be a root of jesse and he that shall rise to reign over the gentiles in him shall the gentiles trust
now the god of hope fill you with all joy and peace in believing that ye may abound in hope through the power of the holy ghost
and i myself also am persuaded of you my brethren that ye also are full of goodness filled with all knowledge able also to admonish one another
nevertheless brethren i have written the more boldly unto you in some sort as putting you in mind because of the grace that is given to me of god
that i should be the minister of jesus christ to the gentiles ministering the gospel of god that the offering up of the gentiles might be acceptable being sanctified by the holy ghost
i have therefore whereof i may glory through jesus christ in those things which pertain to god
for i will not dare to speak of any of those things which christ hath not wrought by me to make the gentiles obedient by word and deed
through mighty signs and wonders by the power of the spirit of god so that from jerusalem and round about unto illyricum i have fully preached the gospel of christ
yea so have i strived to preach the gospel not where christ was named lest i should build upon another man's foundation
but as it is written to whom he was not spoken of they shall see and they that have not heard shall understand
for which cause also i have been much hindered from coming to you
but now having no more place in these parts and having a great desire these many years to come unto you
whensoever i take my journey into spain i will come to you for i trust to see you in my journey and to be brought on my way thitherward by you if first i be somewhat filled with your company
but now i go unto jerusalem to minister unto the saints
for it hath pleased them of macedonia and achaia to make a certain contribution for the poor saints which are at jerusalem
it hath pleased them verily and their debtors they are for if the gentiles have been made partakers of their spiritual things their duty is also to minister unto them in carnal things
when therefore i have performed this and have sealed to them this fruit i will come by you into spain
and i am sure that when i come unto you i shall come in the fulness of the blessing of the gospel of christ
now i beseech you brethren for the lord jesus christ's sake and for the love of the spirit that ye strive together with me in your prayers to god for me
that i may be delivered from them that do not believe in judaea and that my service which i have for jerusalem may be accepted of the saints
that i may come unto you with joy by the will of god and may with you be refreshed
now the god of peace be with you all amen
i commend unto you phebe our sister which is a servant of the church which is at cenchrea
that ye receive her in the lord as becometh saints and that ye assist her in whatsoever business she hath need of you for she hath been a succourer of many and of myself also
greet priscilla and aquila my helpers in christ jesus
who have for my life laid down their own necks unto whom not only i give thanks but also all the churches of the gentiles
likewise greet the church that is in their house salute my wellbeloved epaenetus who is the firstfruits of achaia unto christ
greet mary who bestowed much labour on us
salute andronicus and junia my kinsmen and my fellowprisoners who are of note among the apostles who also were in christ before me
greet amplias my beloved in the lord
salute urbane our helper in christ and stachys my beloved
salute apelles approved in christ salute them which are of aristobulus household
salute herodion my kinsman greet them that be of the household of narcissus which are in the lord
salute tryphena and tryphosa who labour in the lord salute the beloved persis which laboured much in the lord
salute rufus chosen in the lord and his mother and mine
salute asyncritus phlegon hermas patrobas hermes and the brethren which are with them
salute philologus and julia nereus and his sister and olympas and all the saints which are with them
salute one another with an holy kiss the churches of christ salute you
now i beseech you brethren mark them which cause divisions and offences contrary to the doctrine which ye have learned and avoid them
for they that are such serve not our lord jesus christ but their own belly and by good words and fair speeches deceive the hearts of the simple
for your obedience is come abroad unto all men i am glad therefore on your behalf but yet i would have you wise unto that which is good and simple concerning evil
and the god of peace shall bruise satan under your feet shortly the grace of our lord jesus christ be with you amen
timotheus my workfellow and lucius and jason and sosipater my kinsmen salute you
i tertius who wrote this epistle salute you in the lord
gaius mine host and of the whole church saluteth you erastus the chamberlain of the city saluteth you and quartus a brother
the grace of our lord jesus christ be with you all amen
now to him that is of power to stablish you according to my gospel and the preaching of jesus christ according to the revelation of the mystery which was kept secret since the world began
but now is made manifest and by the scriptures of the prophets according to the commandment of the everlasting god made known to all nations for the obedience of faith
to god only wise be glory through jesus christ for ever amen
1cor11 paul called to be an apostle of jesus christ through the will of god and sosthenes our brother
1cor12 unto the church of god which is at corinth to them that are sanctified in christ jesus called to be saints with all that in every place call upon the name of jesus christ our lord both theirs and ours
1cor13 grace be unto you and peace from god our father and from the lord jesus christ
1cor14 i thank my god always on your behalf for the grace of god which is given you by jesus christ
1cor15 that in every thing ye are enriched by him in all utterance and in all knowledge
1cor16 even as the testimony of christ was confirmed in you
1cor17 so that ye come behind in no gift waiting for the coming of our lord jesus christ
1cor18 who shall also confirm you unto the end that ye may be blameless in the day of our lord jesus christ
1cor19 god is faithful by whom ye were called unto the fellowship of his son jesus christ our lord
1cor110 now i beseech you brethren by the name of our lord jesus christ that ye all speak the same thing and that there be no divisions among you but that ye be perfectly joined together in the same mind and in the same judgment
1cor111 for it hath been declared unto me of you my brethren by them which are of the house of chloe that there are contentions among you
1cor112 now this i say that every one of you saith i am of paul and i of apollos and i of cephas and i of christ
1cor113 is christ divided was paul crucified for you or were ye baptized in the name of paul
1cor114 i thank god that i baptized none of you but crispus and gaius
1cor115 lest any should say that i had baptized in mine own name
1cor116 and i baptized also the household of stephanas besides i know not whether i baptized any other
1cor117 for christ sent me not to baptize but to preach the gospel not with wisdom of words lest the cross of christ should be made of none effect
1cor118 for the preaching of the cross is to them that perish foolishness but unto us which are saved it is the power of god
1cor119 for it is written i will destroy the wisdom of the wise and will bring to nothing the understanding of the prudent
1cor120 where is the wise where is the scribe where is the disputer of this world hath not god made foolish the wisdom of this world
1cor121 for after that in the wisdom of god the world by wisdom knew not god it pleased god by the foolishness of preaching to save them that believe
1cor122 for the jews require a sign and the greeks seek after wisdom
1cor123 but we preach christ crucified unto the jews a stumblingblock and unto the greeks foolishness
1cor124 but unto them which are called both jews and greeks christ the power of god and the wisdom of god
1cor125 because the foolishness of god is wiser than men and the weakness of god is stronger than men
1cor126 for ye see your calling brethren how that not many wise men after the flesh not many mighty not many noble are called
1cor127 but god hath chosen the foolish things of the world to confound the wise and god hath chosen the weak things of the world to confound the things which are mighty
1cor128 and base things of the world and things which are despised hath god chosen yea and things which are not to bring to nought things that are
1cor129 that no flesh should glory in his presence
1cor130 but of him are ye in christ jesus who of god is made unto us wisdom and righteousness and sanctification and redemption
1cor131 that according as it is written he that glorieth let him glory in the lord
1cor21 and i brethren when i came to you came not with excellency of speech or of wisdom declaring unto you the testimony of god
1cor22 for i determined not to know any thing among you save jesus christ and him crucified
1cor23 and i was with you in weakness and in fear and in much trembling
