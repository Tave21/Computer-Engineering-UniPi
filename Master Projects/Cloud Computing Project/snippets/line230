 and by that order of proscription
 had you your letters from your wife my lord
brutus no messala
messala nor nothing in your letters writ of her
brutus nothing messala
messala that methinks is strange
brutus why ask you hear you aught of her in yours
messala no my lord
brutus now as you are a roman tell me true
messala then like a roman bear the truth i tell
 for certain she is dead and by strange manner
brutus why farewell portia we must die messala
 with meditating that she must die once
 i have the patience to endure it now
messala even so great men great losses should endure
cassius i have as much of this in art as you
 but yet my nature could not bear it so
brutus well to our work alive what do you think
 of marching to philippi presently
cassius i do not think it good
brutus your reason
cassius this it is
 tis better that the enemy seek us
 so shall he waste his means weary his soldiers
 doing himself offence whilst we lying still
 are full of rest defense and nimbleness
brutus good reasons must of force give place to better
 the people twixt philippi and this ground
 do stand but in a forced affection
 for they have grudged us contribution
 the enemy marching along by them
 by them shall make a fuller number up
 come on refresh'd newadded and encouraged
 from which advantage shall we cut him off
 if at philippi we do face him there
 these people at our back
cassius hear me good brother
brutus under your pardon you must note beside
 that we have tried the utmost of our friends
 our legions are brimfull our cause is ripe
 the enemy increaseth every day
 we at the height are ready to decline
 there is a tide in the affairs of men
 which taken at the flood leads on to fortune
 omitted all the voyage of their life
 is bound in shallows and in miseries
 on such a full sea are we now afloat
 and we must take the current when it serves
 or lose our ventures
cassius then with your will go on
 we'll along ourselves and meet them at philippi
brutus the deep of night is crept upon our talk
 and nature must obey necessity
 which we will niggard with a little rest
 there is no more to say
cassius no more good night
 early tomorrow will we rise and hence
brutus lucius
 enter lucius

 exit lucius

 this is a sleepy tune o murderous slumber
 lay'st thou thy leaden mace upon my boy

 if thou dost nod thou break'st thy instrument
 i'll take it from thee and good boy good night
 let me see let me see is not the leaf turn'd down
 where i left reading here it is i think

act v
scene i the plains of philippi
 enter octavius antony and their army
octavius now antony our hopes are answered
 you said the enemy would not come down
 but keep the hills and upper regions
 it proves not so their battles are at hand
 they mean to warn us at philippi here
 answering before we do demand of them
antony tut i am in their bosoms and i know
 wherefore they do it they could be content
 to visit other places and come down
 with fearful bravery thinking by this face
 to fasten in our thoughts that they have courage
 but tis not so
 enter a messenger
messenger prepare you generals
 the enemy comes on in gallant show
 their bloody sign of battle is hung out
 and something to be done immediately
antony octavius lead your battle softly on
 upon the left hand of the even field
octavius upon the right hand i keep thou the left
antony why do you cross me in this exigent
octavius i do not cross you but i will do so
 march
 drum enter brutus cassius and their army
 lucilius titinius messala and others
brutus they stand and would have parley
cassius stand fast titinius we must out and talk
octavius mark antony shall we give sign of battle
antony no caesar we will answer on their charge
 make forth the generals would have some words
octavius stir not until the signal
brutus words before blows is it so countrymen
octavius not that we love words better as you do
