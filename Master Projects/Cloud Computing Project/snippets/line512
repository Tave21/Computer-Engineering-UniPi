 beggars were whipped i would wish no better office
 than to be beadle but master i'll go draw up the
 net

first fisherman why i'll tell you this is called pentapolis and
 our king the good simonides
pericles the good king simonides do you call him
first fisherman ay sir and he deserves so to be called for his
 peaceable reign and good government
pericles he is a happy king since he gains from his subjects
 the name of good by his government how far is his
 court distant from this shore
first fisherman marry sir half a day's journey and i'll tell
 you he hath a fair daughter and tomorrow is her
 birthday and there are princes and knights come
 from all parts of the world to just and tourney for her love
pericles were my fortunes equal to my desires i could wish
 to make one there
first fisherman o sir things must be as they may and what a man
 cannot get he may lawfully deal forhis wife's soul
 reenter second and third fishermen drawing up a net
second fisherman help master help here's a fish hangs in the net
 like a poor man's right in the law twill hardly
 come out ha bots on't tis come at last and
 tis turned to a rusty armour
pericles an armour friends i pray you let me see it
 thanks fortune yet that after all my crosses
 thou givest me somewhat to repair myself
 and though it was mine own part of my heritage
 which my dead father did bequeath to me
 with this strict charge even as he left his life
 keep it my pericles it hath been a shield
 twixt me and death'and pointed to this brace
 for that it saved me keep it in like necessity
 the which the gods protect thee frommay
 defend thee'
 it kept where i kept i so dearly loved it
 till the rough seas that spare not any man
 took it in rage though calm'd have given't again
 i thank thee for't my shipwreck now's no ill
 since i have here my father's gift in's will
first fisherman what mean you sir
pericles to beg of you kind friends this coat of worth
 for it was sometime target to a king
 i know it by this mark he loved me dearly
 and for his sake i wish the having of it
 and that you'ld guide me to your sovereign's court
 where with it i may appear a gentleman
 and if that ever my low fortune's better
 i'll pay your bounties till then rest your debtor
first fisherman why wilt thou tourney for the lady
pericles i'll show the virtue i have borne in arms
first fisherman why do e take it and the gods give thee good on't
second fisherman ay but hark you my friend twas we that made up
 this garment through the rough seams of the waters
 there are certain condolements certain vails i
 hope sir if you thrive you'll remember from
 whence you had it
pericles believe t i will
 by your furtherance i am clothed in steel
 and spite of all the rapture of the sea
 this jewel holds his building on my arm
 unto thy value i will mount myself
 upon a courser whose delightful steps
 shall make the gazer joy to see him tread
 only my friend i yet am unprovided
 of a pair of bases
second fisherman we'll sure provide thou shalt have my best gown to
 make thee a pair and i'll bring thee to the court myself
pericles then honour be but a goal to my will
 this day i'll rise or else add ill to ill

scene ii the same a public way or platform leading to the
 lists a pavilion by the side of it for the
 reception of king princess lords &c
 enter simonides thaisa lords and attendants
simonides are the knights ready to begin the triumph
first lord they are my liege
 and stay your coming to present themselves
simonides return them we are ready and our daughter
 in honour of whose birth these triumphs are
 sits here like beauty's child whom nature gat
 for men to see and seeing wonder at
 exit a lord
thaisa it pleaseth you my royal father to express
 my commendations great whose merit's less
simonides it's fit it should be so for princes are
 a model which heaven makes like to itself
 as jewels lose their glory if neglected
 so princes their renowns if not respected
 tis now your honour daughter to explain
 the labour of each knight in his device
thaisa which to preserve mine honour i'll perform
 enter a knight he passes over and his squire
 presents his shield to the princess
simonides who is the first that doth prefer himself
thaisa a knight of sparta my renowned father
 and the device he bears upon his shield
 is a black ethiope reaching at the sun
 the word lux tua vita mihi'
simonides he loves you well that holds his life of you
 the second knight passes over
 who is the second that presents himself
thaisa a prince of macedon my royal father
 and the device he bears upon his shield
 is an arm'd knight that's conquer'd by a lady
 the motto thus in spanish piu por dulzura que por fuerza'
 the third knight passes over
simonides and what's the third
thaisa the third of antioch
 and his device a wreath of chivalry
 the word me pompae provexit apex'
 the fourth knight passes over
simonides what is the fourth
thaisa a burning torch that's turned upside down
 the word quod me alit me extinguit'
simonides which shows that beauty hath his power and will
 which can as well inflame as it can kill
 the fifth knight passes over
thaisa the fifth an hand environed with clouds
 holding out gold that's by the touchstone tried
 the motto thus sic spectanda fides'
 the sixth knight pericles passes over
simonides and what's
 the sixth and last the which the knight himself
 with such a graceful courtesy deliver'd
thaisa he seems to be a stranger but his present is
 a wither'd branch that's only green at top
 the motto in hac spe vivo'
simonides a pretty moral
 from the dejected state wherein he is
 he hopes by you his fortunes yet may flourish
first lord he had need mean better than his outward show
 can any way speak in his just commend
 for by his rusty outside he appears
 to have practised more the whipstock than the lance
second lord he well may be a stranger for he comes
 to an honour'd triumph strangely furnished
third lord and on set purpose let his armour rust
 until this day to scour it in the dust
simonides opinion's but a fool that makes us scan
 the outward habit by the inward man
 but stay the knights are coming we will withdraw
 into the gallery
 exeunt
 great shouts within and all cry the mean knight'

act ii
scene iii the same a hall of state a banquet prepared
 enter simonides thaisa lords attendants and
 knights from tilting
simonides knights
 to say you're welcome were superfluous
 to place upon the volume of your deeds
 as in a titlepage your worth in arms
 were more than you expect or more than's fit
 since every worth in show commends itself
 prepare for mirth for mirth becomes a feast
 you are princes and my guests
thaisa but you my knight and guest
 to whom this wreath of victory i give
 and crown you king of this day's happiness
pericles tis more by fortune lady than by merit
simonides call it by what you will the day is yours
 and here i hope is none that envies it
 in framing an artist art hath thus decreed
 to make some good but others to exceed
 and you are her labour'd scholar come queen o'
 the feast
 for daughter so you arehere take your place
 marshal the rest as they deserve their grace
knights we are honour'd much by good simonides
simonides your presence glads our days honour we love
 for who hates honour hates the gods above
marshal sir yonder is your place
pericles some other is more fit
first knight contend not sir for we are gentlemen
 that neither in our hearts nor outward eyes
 envy the great nor do the low despise
pericles you are right courteous knights
simonides sit sir sit
pericles by jove i wonder that is king of thoughts
 these cates resist me she but thought upon
thaisa by juno that is queen of marriage
 all viands that i eat do seem unsavoury
