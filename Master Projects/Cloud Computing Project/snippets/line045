1ki813 i have surely built thee an house to dwell in a settled place for thee to abide in for ever
1ki814 and the king turned his face about and blessed all the congregation of israel and all the congregation of israel stood
1ki815 and he said blessed be the lord god of israel which spake with his mouth unto david my father and hath with his hand fulfilled it saying
1ki816 since the day that i brought forth my people israel out of egypt i chose no city out of all the tribes of israel to build an house that my name might be therein but i chose david to be over my people israel
1ki817 and it was in the heart of david my father to build an house for the name of the lord god of israel
1ki818 and the lord said unto david my father whereas it was in thine heart to build an house unto my name thou didst well that it was in thine heart
1ki819 nevertheless thou shalt not build the house but thy son that shall come forth out of thy loins he shall build the house unto my name
1ki820 and the lord hath performed his word that he spake and i am risen up in the room of david my father and sit on the throne of israel as the lord promised and have built an house for the name of the lord god of israel
1ki821 and i have set there a place for the ark wherein is the covenant of the lord which he made with our fathers when he brought them out of the land of egypt
1ki822 and solomon stood before the altar of the lord in the presence of all the congregation of israel and spread forth his hands toward heaven
1ki823 and he said lord god of israel there is no god like thee in heaven above or on earth beneath who keepest covenant and mercy with thy servants that walk before thee with all their heart
1ki824 who hast kept with thy servant david my father that thou promisedst him thou spakest also with thy mouth and hast fulfilled it with thine hand as it is this day
1ki825 therefore now lord god of israel keep with thy servant david my father that thou promisedst him saying there shall not fail thee a man in my sight to sit on the throne of israel so that thy children take heed to their way that they walk before me as thou hast walked before me
1ki826 and now o god of israel let thy word i pray thee be verified which thou spakest unto thy servant david my father
1ki827 but will god indeed dwell on the earth behold the heaven and heaven of heavens cannot contain thee how much less this house that i have builded
1ki828 yet have thou respect unto the prayer of thy servant and to his supplication o lord my god to hearken unto the cry and to the prayer which thy servant prayeth before thee to day
1ki829 that thine eyes may be open toward this house night and day even toward the place of which thou hast said my name shall be there that thou mayest hearken unto the prayer which thy servant shall make toward this place
1ki830 and hearken thou to the supplication of thy servant and of thy people israel when they shall pray toward this place and hear thou in heaven thy dwelling place and when thou hearest forgive
1ki831 if any man trespass against his neighbour and an oath be laid upon him to cause him to swear and the oath come before thine altar in this house
1ki832 then hear thou in heaven and do and judge thy servants condemning the wicked to bring his way upon his head and justifying the righteous to give him according to his righteousness
1ki833 when thy people israel be smitten down before the enemy because they have sinned against thee and shall turn again to thee and confess thy name and pray and make supplication unto thee in this house
1ki834 then hear thou in heaven and forgive the sin of thy people israel and bring them again unto the land which thou gavest unto their fathers
1ki835 when heaven is shut up and there is no rain because they have sinned against thee if they pray toward this place and confess thy name and turn from their sin when thou afflictest them
1ki836 then hear thou in heaven and forgive the sin of thy servants and of thy people israel that thou teach them the good way wherein they should walk and give rain upon thy land which thou hast given to thy people for an inheritance
1ki837 if there be in the land famine if there be pestilence blasting mildew locust or if there be caterpiller if their enemy besiege them in the land of their cities whatsoever plague whatsoever sickness there be
1ki838 what prayer and supplication soever be made by any man or by all thy people israel which shall know every man the plague of his own heart and spread forth his hands toward this house
1ki839 then hear thou in heaven thy dwelling place and forgive and do and give to every man according to his ways whose heart thou knowest for thou even thou only knowest the hearts of all the children of men
1ki840 that they may fear thee all the days that they live in the land which thou gavest unto our fathers
1ki841 moreover concerning a stranger that is not of thy people israel but cometh out of a far country for thy name's sake
1ki842 for they shall hear of thy great name and of thy strong hand and of thy stretched out arm when he shall come and pray toward this house
1ki843 hear thou in heaven thy dwelling place and do according to all that the stranger calleth to thee for that all people of the earth may know thy name to fear thee as do thy people israel and that they may know that this house which i have builded is called by thy name
1ki844 if thy people go out to battle against their enemy whithersoever thou shalt send them and shall pray unto the lord toward the city which thou hast chosen and toward the house that i have built for thy name
1ki845 then hear thou in heaven their prayer and their supplication and maintain their cause
1ki846 if they sin against thee for there is no man that sinneth not and thou be angry with them and deliver them to the enemy so that they carry them away captives unto the land of the enemy far or near
1ki847 yet if they shall bethink themselves in the land whither they were carried captives and repent and make supplication unto thee in the land of them that carried them captives saying we have sinned and have done perversely we have committed wickedness
1ki848 and so return unto thee with all their heart and with all their soul in the land of their enemies which led them away captive and pray unto thee toward their land which thou gavest unto their fathers the city which thou hast chosen and the house which i have built for thy name
1ki849 then hear thou their prayer and their supplication in heaven thy dwelling place and maintain their cause
1ki850 and forgive thy people that have sinned against thee and all their transgressions wherein they have transgressed against thee and give them compassion before them who carried them captive that they may have compassion on them
1ki851 for they be thy people and thine inheritance which thou broughtest forth out of egypt from the midst of the furnace of iron
1ki852 that thine eyes may be open unto the supplication of thy servant and unto the supplication of thy people israel to hearken unto them in all that they call for unto thee
1ki853 for thou didst separate them from among all the people of the earth to be thine inheritance as thou spakest by the hand of moses thy servant when thou broughtest our fathers out of egypt o lord god
1ki854 and it was so that when solomon had made an end of praying all this prayer and supplication unto the lord he arose from before the altar of the lord from kneeling on his knees with his hands spread up to heaven
1ki855 and he stood and blessed all the congregation of israel with a loud voice saying
1ki856 blessed be the lord that hath given rest unto his people israel according to all that he promised there hath not failed one word of all his good promise which he promised by the hand of moses his servant
1ki857 the lord our god be with us as he was with our fathers let him not leave us nor forsake us
1ki858 that he may incline our hearts unto him to walk in all his ways and to keep his commandments and his statutes and his judgments which he commanded our fathers
1ki859 and let these my words wherewith i have made supplication before the lord be nigh unto the lord our god day and night that he maintain the cause of his servant and the cause of his people israel at all times as the matter shall require
1ki860 that all the people of the earth may know that the lord is god and that there is none else
1ki861 let your heart therefore be perfect with the lord our god to walk in his statutes and to keep his commandments as at this day
1ki862 and the king and all israel with him offered sacrifice before the lord
1ki863 and solomon offered a sacrifice of peace offerings which he offered unto the lord two and twenty thousand oxen and an hundred and twenty thousand sheep so the king and all the children of israel dedicated the house of the lord
1ki864 the same day did the king hallow the middle of the court that was before the house of the lord for there he offered burnt offerings and meat offerings and the fat of the peace offerings because the brasen altar that was before the lord was too little to receive the burnt offerings and meat offerings and the fat of the peace offerings
1ki865 and at that time solomon held a feast and all israel with him a great congregation from the entering in of hamath unto the river of egypt before the lord our god seven days and seven days even fourteen days
1ki866 on the eighth day he sent the people away and they blessed the king and went unto their tents joyful and glad of heart for all the goodness that the lord had done for david his servant and for israel his people
1ki91 and it came to pass when solomon had finished the building of the house of the lord and the king's house and all solomon's desire which he was pleased to do
1ki92 that the lord appeared to solomon the second time as he had appeared unto him at gibeon
1ki93 and the lord said unto him i have heard thy prayer and thy supplication that thou hast made before me i have hallowed this house which thou hast built to put my name there for ever and mine eyes and mine heart shall be there perpetually
1ki94 and if thou wilt walk before me as david thy father walked in integrity of heart and in uprightness to do according to all that i have commanded thee and wilt keep my statutes and my judgments
1ki95 then i will establish the throne of thy kingdom upon israel for ever as i promised to david thy father saying there shall not fail thee a man upon the throne of israel
1ki96 but if ye shall at all turn from following me ye or your children and will not keep my commandments and my statutes which i have set before you but go and serve other gods and worship them
1ki97 then will i cut off israel out of the land which i have given them and this house which i have hallowed for my name will i cast out of my sight and israel shall be a proverb and a byword among all people
1ki98 and at this house which is high every one that passeth by it shall be astonished and shall hiss and they shall say why hath the lord done thus unto this land and to this house
1ki99 and they shall answer because they forsook the lord their god who brought forth their fathers out of the land of egypt and have taken hold upon other gods and have worshipped them and served them therefore hath the lord brought upon them all this evil
1ki910 and it came to pass at the end of twenty years when solomon had built the two houses the house of the lord and the king's house
1ki911 now hiram the king of tyre had furnished solomon with cedar trees and fir trees and with gold according to all his desire that then king solomon gave hiram twenty cities in the land of galilee
1ki912 and hiram came out from tyre to see the cities which solomon had given him and they pleased him not
1ki913 and he said what cities are these which thou hast given me my brother and he called them the land of cabul unto this day
1ki914 and hiram sent to the king sixscore talents of gold
1ki915 and this is the reason of the levy which king solomon raised for to build the house of the lord and his own house and millo and the wall of jerusalem and hazor and megiddo and gezer
1ki916 for pharaoh king of egypt had gone up and taken gezer and burnt it with fire and slain the canaanites that dwelt in the city and given it for a present unto his daughter solomon's wife
1ki917 and solomon built gezer and bethhoron the nether
1ki918 and baalath and tadmor in the wilderness in the land
1ki919 and all the cities of store that solomon had and cities for his chariots and cities for his horsemen and that which solomon desired to build in jerusalem and in lebanon and in all the land of his dominion
1ki920 and all the people that were left of the amorites hittites perizzites hivites and jebusites which were not of the children of israel
1ki921 their children that were left after them in the land whom the children of israel also were not able utterly to destroy upon those did solomon levy a tribute of bondservice unto this day
1ki922 but of the children of israel did solomon make no bondmen but they were men of war and his servants and his princes and his captains and rulers of his chariots and his horsemen
1ki923 these were the chief of the officers that were over solomon's work five hundred and fifty which bare rule over the people that wrought in the work
1ki924 but pharaoh's daughter came up out of the city of david unto her house which solomon had built for her then did he build millo
1ki925 and three times in a year did solomon offer burnt offerings and peace offerings upon the altar which he built unto the lord and he burnt incense upon the altar that was before the lord so he finished the house
1ki926 and king solomon made a navy of ships in eziongeber which is beside eloth on the shore of the red sea in the land of edom
1ki927 and hiram sent in the navy his servants shipmen that had knowledge of the sea with the servants of solomon
1ki928 and they came to ophir and fetched from thence gold four hundred and twenty talents and brought it to king solomon
1ki101 and when the queen of sheba heard of the fame of solomon concerning the name of the lord she came to prove him with hard questions
1ki102 and she came to jerusalem with a very great train with camels that bare spices and very much gold and precious stones and when she was come to solomon she communed with him of all that was in her heart
1ki103 and solomon told her all her questions there was not any thing hid from the king which he told her not
1ki104 and when the queen of sheba had seen all solomon's wisdom and the house that he had built
1ki105 and the meat of his table and the sitting of his servants and the attendance of his ministers and their apparel and his cupbearers and his ascent by which he went up unto the house of the lord there was no more spirit in her
1ki106 and she said to the king it was a true report that i heard in mine own land of thy acts and of thy wisdom
1ki107 howbeit i believed not the words until i came and mine eyes had seen it and behold the half was not told me thy wisdom and prosperity exceedeth the fame which i heard
1ki108 happy are thy men happy are these thy servants which stand continually before thee and that hear thy wisdom
1ki109 blessed be the lord thy god which delighted in thee to set thee on the throne of israel because the lord loved israel for ever therefore made he thee king to do judgment and justice
1ki1010 and she gave the king an hundred and twenty talents of gold and of spices very great store and precious stones there came no more such abundance of spices as these which the queen of sheba gave to king solomon
1ki1011 and the navy also of hiram that brought gold from ophir brought in from ophir great plenty of almug trees and precious stones
1ki1012 and the king made of the almug trees pillars for the house of the lord and for the king's house harps also and psalteries for singers there came no such almug trees nor were seen unto this day
1ki1013 and king solomon gave unto the queen of sheba all her desire whatsoever she asked beside that which solomon gave her of his royal bounty so she turned and went to her own country she and her servants
1ki1014 now the weight of gold that came to solomon in one year was six hundred threescore and six talents of gold
1ki1015 beside that he had of the merchantmen and of the traffick of the spice merchants and of all the kings of arabia and of the governors of the country
1ki1016 and king solomon made two hundred targets of beaten gold six hundred shekels of gold went to one target
1ki1017 and he made three hundred shields of beaten gold three pound of gold went to one shield and the king put them in the house of the forest of lebanon
1ki1018 moreover the king made a great throne of ivory and overlaid it with the best gold
1ki1019 the throne had six steps and the top of the throne was round behind and there were stays on either side on the place of the seat and two lions stood beside the stays
1ki1020 and twelve lions stood there on the one side and on the other upon the six steps there was not the like made in any kingdom
1ki1021 and all king solomon's drinking vessels were of gold and all the vessels of the house of the forest of lebanon were of pure gold none were of silver it was nothing accounted of in the days of solomon
1ki1022 for the king had at sea a navy of tharshish with the navy of hiram once in three years came the navy of tharshish bringing gold and silver ivory and apes and peacocks
1ki1023 so king solomon exceeded all the kings of the earth for riches and for wisdom
1ki1024 and all the earth sought to solomon to hear his wisdom which god had put in his heart
1ki1025 and they brought every man his present vessels of silver and vessels of gold and garments and armour and spices horses and mules a rate year by year
1ki1026 and solomon gathered together chariots and horsemen and he had a thousand and four hundred chariots and twelve thousand horsemen whom he bestowed in the cities for chariots and with the king at jerusalem
1ki1027 and the king made silver to be in jerusalem as stones and cedars made he to be as the sycomore trees that are in the vale for abundance
1ki1028 and solomon had horses brought out of egypt and linen yarn the king's merchants received the linen yarn at a price
1ki1029 and a chariot came up and went out of egypt for six hundred shekels of silver and an horse for an hundred and fifty and so for all the kings of the hittites and for the kings of syria did they bring them out by their means
1ki111 but king solomon loved many strange women together with the daughter of pharaoh women of the moabites ammonites edomites zidonians and hittites
1ki112 of the nations concerning which the lord said unto the children of israel ye shall not go in to them neither shall they come in unto you for surely they will turn away your heart after their gods solomon clave unto these in love
1ki113 and he had seven hundred wives princesses and three hundred concubines and his wives turned away his heart
1ki114 for it came to pass when solomon was old that his wives turned away his heart after other gods and his heart was not perfect with the lord his god as was the heart of david his father
1ki115 for solomon went after ashtoreth the goddess of the zidonians and after milcom the abomination of the ammonites
1ki116 and solomon did evil in the sight of the lord and went not fully after the lord as did david his father
1ki117 then did solomon build an high place for chemosh the abomination of moab in the hill that is before jerusalem and for molech the abomination of the children of ammon
1ki118 and likewise did he for all his strange wives which burnt incense and sacrificed unto their gods
1ki119 and the lord was angry with solomon because his heart was turned from the lord god of israel which had appeared unto him twice
1ki1110 and had commanded him concerning this thing that he should not go after other gods but he kept not that which the lord commanded
1ki1111 wherefore the lord said unto solomon forasmuch as this is done of thee and thou hast not kept my covenant and my statutes which i have commanded thee i will surely rend the kingdom from thee and will give it to thy servant
1ki1112 notwithstanding in thy days i will not do it for david thy father's sake but i will rend it out of the hand of thy son
1ki1113 howbeit i will not rend away all the kingdom but will give one tribe to thy son for david my servant's sake and for jerusalem's sake which i have chosen
1ki1114 and the lord stirred up an adversary unto solomon hadad the edomite he was of the king's seed in edom
1ki1115 for it came to pass when david was in edom and joab the captain of the host was gone up to bury the slain after he had smitten every male in edom
1ki1116 for six months did joab remain there with all israel until he had cut off every male in edom
1ki1117 that hadad fled he and certain edomites of his father's servants with him to go into egypt hadad being yet a little child
1ki1118 and they arose out of midian and came to paran and they took men with them out of paran and they came to egypt unto pharaoh king of egypt which gave him an house and appointed him victuals and gave him land
1ki1119 and hadad found great favour in the sight of pharaoh so that he gave him to wife the sister of his own wife the sister of tahpenes the queen
1ki1120 and the sister of tahpenes bare him genubath his son whom tahpenes weaned in pharaoh's house and genubath was in pharaoh's household among the sons of pharaoh
1ki1121 and when hadad heard in egypt that david slept with his fathers and that joab the captain of the host was dead hadad said to pharaoh let me depart that i may go to mine own country
1ki1122 then pharaoh said unto him but what hast thou lacked with me that behold thou seekest to go to thine own country and he answered nothing howbeit let me go in any wise
1ki1123 and god stirred him up another adversary rezon the son of eliadah which fled from his lord hadadezer king of zobah
1ki1124 and he gathered men unto him and became captain over a band when david slew them of zobah and they went to damascus and dwelt therein and reigned in damascus
1ki1125 and he was an adversary to israel all the days of solomon beside the mischief that hadad did and he abhorred israel and reigned over syria
1ki1126 and jeroboam the son of nebat an ephrathite of zereda solomon's servant whose mother's name was zeruah a widow woman even he lifted up his hand against the king
1ki1127 and this was the cause that he lifted up his hand against the king solomon built millo and repaired the breaches of the city of david his father
1ki1128 and the man jeroboam was a mighty man of valour and solomon seeing the young man that he was industrious he made him ruler over all the charge of the house of joseph
1ki1129 and it came to pass at that time when jeroboam went out of jerusalem that the prophet ahijah the shilonite found him in the way and he had clad himself with a new garment and they two were alone in the field
1ki1130 and ahijah caught the new garment that was on him and rent it in twelve pieces
1ki1131 and he said to jeroboam take thee ten pieces for thus saith the lord the god of israel behold i will rend the kingdom out of the hand of solomon and will give ten tribes to thee
1ki1132 but he shall have one tribe for my servant david's sake and for jerusalem's sake the city which i have chosen out of all the tribes of israel
1ki1133 because that they have forsaken me and have worshipped ashtoreth the goddess of the zidonians chemosh the god of the moabites and milcom the god of the children of ammon and have not walked in my ways to do that which is right in mine eyes and to keep my statutes and my judgments as did david his father
1ki1134 howbeit i will not take the whole kingdom out of his hand but i will make him prince all the days of his life for david my servant's sake whom i chose because he kept my commandments and my statutes
1ki1135 but i will take the kingdom out of his son's hand and will give it unto thee even ten tribes
1ki1136 and unto his son will i give one tribe that david my servant may have a light alway before me in jerusalem the city which i have chosen me to put my name there
1ki1137 and i will take thee and thou shalt reign according to all that thy soul desireth and shalt be king over israel
1ki1138 and it shall be if thou wilt hearken unto all that i command thee and wilt walk in my ways and do that is right in my sight to keep my statutes and my commandments as david my servant did that i will be with thee and build thee a sure house as i built for david and will give israel unto thee
1ki1139 and i will for this afflict the seed of david but not for ever
1ki1140 solomon sought therefore to kill jeroboam and jeroboam arose and fled into egypt unto shishak king of egypt and was in egypt until the death of solomon
1ki1141 and the rest of the acts of solomon and all that he did and his wisdom are they not written in the book of the acts of solomon
1ki1142 and the time that solomon reigned in jerusalem over all israel was forty years
1ki1143 and solomon slept with his fathers and was buried in the city of david his father and rehoboam his son reigned in his stead
1ki121 and rehoboam went to shechem for all israel were come to shechem to make him king
1ki122 and it came to pass when jeroboam the son of nebat who was yet in egypt heard of it for he was fled from the presence of king solomon and jeroboam dwelt in egypt
1ki123 that they sent and called him and jeroboam and all the congregation of israel came and spake unto rehoboam saying
1ki124 thy father made our yoke grievous now therefore make thou the grievous service of thy father and his heavy yoke which he put upon us lighter and we will serve thee
1ki125 and he said unto them depart yet for three days then come again to me and the people departed
1ki126 and king rehoboam consulted with the old men that stood before solomon his father while he yet lived and said how do ye advise that i may answer this people
1ki127 and they spake unto him saying if thou wilt be a servant unto this people this day and wilt serve them and answer them and speak good words to them then they will be thy servants for ever
1ki128 but he forsook the counsel of the old men which they had given him and consulted with the young men that were grown up with him and which stood before him
1ki129 and he said unto them what counsel give ye that we may answer this people who have spoken to me saying make the yoke which thy father did put upon us lighter
1ki1210 and the young men that were grown up with him spake unto him saying thus shalt thou speak unto this people that spake unto thee saying thy father made our yoke heavy but make thou it lighter unto us thus shalt thou say unto them my little finger shall be thicker than my father's loins
1ki1211 and now whereas my father did lade you with a heavy yoke i will add to your yoke my father hath chastised you with whips but i will chastise you with scorpions
1ki1212 so jeroboam and all the people came to rehoboam the third day as the king had appointed saying come to me again the third day
1ki1213 and the king answered the people roughly and forsook the old men's counsel that they gave him
1ki1214 and spake to them after the counsel of the young men saying my father made your yoke heavy and i will add to your yoke my father also chastised you with whips but i will chastise you with scorpions
1ki1215 wherefore the king hearkened not unto the people for the cause was from the lord that he might perform his saying which the lord spake by ahijah the shilonite unto jeroboam the son of nebat
1ki1216 so when all israel saw that the king hearkened not unto them the people answered the king saying what portion have we in david neither have we inheritance in the son of jesse to your tents o israel now see to thine own house david so israel departed unto their tents
1ki1217 but as for the children of israel which dwelt in the cities of judah rehoboam reigned over them
1ki1218 then king rehoboam sent adoram who was over the tribute and all israel stoned him with stones that he died therefore king rehoboam made speed to get him up to his chariot to flee to jerusalem
1ki1219 so israel rebelled against the house of david unto this day
1ki1220 and it came to pass when all israel heard that jeroboam was come again that they sent and called him unto the congregation and made him king over all israel there was none that followed the house of david but the tribe of judah only
1ki1221 and when rehoboam was come to jerusalem he assembled all the house of judah with the tribe of benjamin an hundred and fourscore thousand chosen men which were warriors to fight against the house of israel to bring the kingdom again to rehoboam the son of solomon
1ki1222 but the word of god came unto shemaiah the man of god saying
1ki1223 speak unto rehoboam the son of solomon king of judah and unto all the house of judah and benjamin and to the remnant of the people saying
1ki1224 thus saith the lord ye shall not go up nor fight against your brethren the children of israel return every man to his house for this thing is from me they hearkened therefore to the word of the lord and returned to depart according to the word of the lord
1ki1225 then jeroboam built shechem in mount ephraim and dwelt therein and went out from thence and built penuel
1ki1226 and jeroboam said in his heart now shall the kingdom return to the house of david
1ki1227 if this people go up to do sacrifice in the house of the lord at jerusalem then shall the heart of this people turn again unto their lord even unto rehoboam king of judah and they shall kill me and go again to rehoboam king of judah
1ki1228 whereupon the king took counsel and made two calves of gold and said unto them it is too much for you to go up to jerusalem behold thy gods o israel which brought thee up out of the land of egypt
1ki1229 and he set the one in bethel and the other put he in dan
1ki1230 and this thing became a sin for the people went to worship before the one even unto dan
1ki1231 and he made an house of high places and made priests of the lowest of the people which were not of the sons of levi
1ki1232 and jeroboam ordained a feast in the eighth month on the fifteenth day of the month like unto the feast that is in judah and he offered upon the altar so did he in bethel sacrificing unto the calves that he had made and he placed in bethel the priests of the high places which he had made
1ki1233 so he offered upon the altar which he had made in bethel the fifteenth day of the eighth month even in the month which he had devised of his own heart and ordained a feast unto the children of israel and he offered upon the altar and burnt incense
1ki131 and behold there came a man of god out of judah by the word of the lord unto bethel and jeroboam stood by the altar to burn incense
1ki132 and he cried against the altar in the word of the lord and said o altar altar thus saith the lord behold a child shall be born unto the house of david josiah by name and upon thee shall he offer the priests of the high places that burn incense upon thee and men's bones shall be burnt upon thee
1ki133 and he gave a sign the same day saying this is the sign which the lord hath spoken behold the altar shall be rent and the ashes that are upon it shall be poured out
1ki134 and it came to pass when king jeroboam heard the saying of the man of god which had cried against the altar in bethel that he put forth his hand from the altar saying lay hold on him and his hand which he put forth against him dried up so that he could not pull it in again to him
1ki135 the altar also was rent and the ashes poured out from the altar according to the sign which the man of god had given by the word of the lord
1ki136 and the king answered and said unto the man of god intreat now the face of the lord thy god and pray for me that my hand may be restored me again and the man of god besought the lord and the king's hand was restored him again and became as it was before
1ki137 and the king said unto the man of god come home with me and refresh thyself and i will give thee a reward
1ki138 and the man of god said unto the king if thou wilt give me half thine house i will not go in with thee neither will i eat bread nor drink water in this place
1ki139 for so was it charged me by the word of the lord saying eat no bread nor drink water nor turn again by the same way that thou camest
1ki1310 so he went another way and returned not by the way that he came to bethel
1ki1311 now there dwelt an old prophet in bethel and his sons came and told him all the works that the man of god had done that day in bethel the words which he had spoken unto the king them they told also to their father
1ki1312 and their father said unto them what way went he for his sons had seen what way the man of god went which came from judah
1ki1313 and he said unto his sons saddle me the ass so they saddled him the ass and he rode thereon
