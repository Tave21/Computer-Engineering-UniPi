moreover the multitude of thy strangers shall be like small dust and the multitude of the terrible ones shall be as chaff that passeth away yea it shall be at an instant suddenly
thou shalt be visited of the lord of hosts with thunder and with earthquake and great noise with storm and tempest and the flame of devouring fire
and the multitude of all the nations that fight against ariel even all that fight against her and her munition and that distress her shall be as a dream of a night vision
it shall even be as when an hungry man dreameth and behold he eateth but he awaketh and his soul is empty or as when a thirsty man dreameth and behold he drinketh but he awaketh and behold he is faint and his soul hath appetite so shall the multitude of all the nations be that fight against mount zion
stay yourselves and wonder cry ye out and cry they are drunken but not with wine they stagger but not with strong drink
for the lord hath poured out upon you the spirit of deep sleep and hath closed your eyes the prophets and your rulers the seers hath he covered
and the vision of all is become unto you as the words of a book that is sealed which men deliver to one that is learned saying read this i pray thee and he saith i cannot for it is sealed
and the book is delivered to him that is not learned saying read this i pray thee and he saith i am not learned
wherefore the lord said forasmuch as this people draw near me with their mouth and with their lips do honour me but have removed their heart far from me and their fear toward me is taught by the precept of men
therefore behold i will proceed to do a marvellous work among this people even a marvellous work and a wonder for the wisdom of their wise men shall perish and the understanding of their prudent men shall be hid
woe unto them that seek deep to hide their counsel from the lord and their works are in the dark and they say who seeth us and who knoweth us
surely your turning of things upside down shall be esteemed as the potter's clay for shall the work say of him that made it he made me not or shall the thing framed say of him that framed it he had no understanding
is it not yet a very little while and lebanon shall be turned into a fruitful field and the fruitful field shall be esteemed as a forest
and in that day shall the deaf hear the words of the book and the eyes of the blind shall see out of obscurity and out of darkness
the meek also shall increase their joy in the lord and the poor among men shall rejoice in the holy one of israel
for the terrible one is brought to nought and the scorner is consumed and all that watch for iniquity are cut off
that make a man an offender for a word and lay a snare for him that reproveth in the gate and turn aside the just for a thing of nought
therefore thus saith the lord who redeemed abraham concerning the house of jacob jacob shall not now be ashamed neither shall his face now wax pale
but when he seeth his children the work of mine hands in the midst of him they shall sanctify my name and sanctify the holy one of jacob and shall fear the god of israel
they also that erred in spirit shall come to understanding and they that murmured shall learn doctrine
woe to the rebellious children saith the lord that take counsel but not of me and that cover with a covering but not of my spirit that they may add sin to sin
that walk to go down into egypt and have not asked at my mouth to strengthen themselves in the strength of pharaoh and to trust in the shadow of egypt
therefore shall the strength of pharaoh be your shame and the trust in the shadow of egypt your confusion
for his princes were at zoan and his ambassadors came to hanes
they were all ashamed of a people that could not profit them nor be an help nor profit but a shame and also a reproach
the burden of the beasts of the south into the land of trouble and anguish from whence come the young and old lion the viper and fiery flying serpent they will carry their riches upon the shoulders of young asses and their treasures upon the bunches of camels to a people that shall not profit them
for the egyptians shall help in vain and to no purpose therefore have i cried concerning this their strength is to sit still
now go write it before them in a table and note it in a book that it may be for the time to come for ever and ever
that this is a rebellious people lying children children that will not hear the law of the lord
which say to the seers see not and to the prophets prophesy not unto us right things speak unto us smooth things prophesy deceits
get you out of the way turn aside out of the path cause the holy one of israel to cease from before us
wherefore thus saith the holy one of israel because ye despise this word and trust in oppression and perverseness and stay thereon
therefore this iniquity shall be to you as a breach ready to fall swelling out in a high wall whose breaking cometh suddenly at an instant
and he shall break it as the breaking of the potters vessel that is broken in pieces he shall not spare so that there shall not be found in the bursting of it a sherd to take fire from the hearth or to take water withal out of the pit
for thus saith the lord god the holy one of israel in returning and rest shall ye be saved in quietness and in confidence shall be your strength and ye would not
but ye said no for we will flee upon horses therefore shall ye flee and we will ride upon the swift therefore shall they that pursue you be swift
one thousand shall flee at the rebuke of one at the rebuke of five shall ye flee till ye be left as a beacon upon the top of a mountain and as an ensign on an hill
and therefore will the lord wait that he may be gracious unto you and therefore will he be exalted that he may have mercy upon you for the lord is a god of judgment blessed are all they that wait for him
for the people shall dwell in zion at jerusalem thou shalt weep no more he will be very gracious unto thee at the voice of thy cry when he shall hear it he will answer thee
and though the lord give you the bread of adversity and the water of affliction yet shall not thy teachers be removed into a corner any more but thine eyes shall see thy teachers
and thine ears shall hear a word behind thee saying this is the way walk ye in it when ye turn to the right hand and when ye turn to the left
ye shall defile also the covering of thy graven images of silver and the ornament of thy molten images of gold thou shalt cast them away as a menstruous cloth thou shalt say unto it get thee hence
then shall he give the rain of thy seed that thou shalt sow the ground withal and bread of the increase of the earth and it shall be fat and plenteous in that day shall thy cattle feed in large pastures
the oxen likewise and the young asses that ear the ground shall eat clean provender which hath been winnowed with the shovel and with the fan
and there shall be upon every high mountain and upon every high hill rivers and streams of waters in the day of the great slaughter when the towers fall
moreover the light of the moon shall be as the light of the sun and the light of the sun shall be sevenfold as the light of seven days in the day that the lord bindeth up the breach of his people and healeth the stroke of their wound
behold the name of the lord cometh from far burning with his anger and the burden thereof is heavy his lips are full of indignation and his tongue as a devouring fire
and his breath as an overflowing stream shall reach to the midst of the neck to sift the nations with the sieve of vanity and there shall be a bridle in the jaws of the people causing them to err
ye shall have a song as in the night when a holy solemnity is kept and gladness of heart as when one goeth with a pipe to come into the mountain of the lord to the mighty one of israel
and the lord shall cause his glorious voice to be heard and shall shew the lighting down of his arm with the indignation of his anger and with the flame of a devouring fire with scattering and tempest and hailstones
for through the voice of the lord shall the assyrian be beaten down which smote with a rod
and in every place where the grounded staff shall pass which the lord shall lay upon him it shall be with tabrets and harps and in battles of shaking will he fight with it
for tophet is ordained of old yea for the king it is prepared he hath made it deep and large the pile thereof is fire and much wood the breath of the lord like a stream of brimstone doth kindle it
woe to them that go down to egypt for help and stay on horses and trust in chariots because they are many and in horsemen because they are very strong but they look not unto the holy one of israel neither seek the lord
yet he also is wise and will bring evil and will not call back his words but will arise against the house of the evildoers and against the help of them that work iniquity
now the egyptians are men and not god and their horses flesh and not spirit when the lord shall stretch out his hand both he that helpeth shall fall and he that is holpen shall fall down and they all shall fail together
for thus hath the lord spoken unto me like as the lion and the young lion roaring on his prey when a multitude of shepherds is called forth against him he will not be afraid of their voice nor abase himself for the noise of them so shall the lord of hosts come down to fight for mount zion and for the hill thereof
as birds flying so will the lord of hosts defend jerusalem defending also he will deliver it and passing over he will preserve it
turn ye unto him from whom the children of israel have deeply revolted
for in that day every man shall cast away his idols of silver and his idols of gold which your own hands have made unto you for a sin
then shall the assyrian fall with the sword not of a mighty man and the sword not of a mean man shall devour him but he shall flee from the sword and his young men shall be discomfited
and he shall pass over to his strong hold for fear and his princes shall be afraid of the ensign saith the lord whose fire is in zion and his furnace in jerusalem
behold a king shall reign in righteousness and princes shall rule in judgment
and a man shall be as an hiding place from the wind and a covert from the tempest as rivers of water in a dry place as the shadow of a great rock in a weary land
and the eyes of them that see shall not be dim and the ears of them that hear shall hearken
the heart also of the rash shall understand knowledge and the tongue of the stammerers shall be ready to speak plainly
the vile person shall be no more called liberal nor the churl said to be bountiful
for the vile person will speak villany and his heart will work iniquity to practise hypocrisy and to utter error against the lord to make empty the soul of the hungry and he will cause the drink of the thirsty to fail
the instruments also of the churl are evil he deviseth wicked devices to destroy the poor with lying words even when the needy speaketh right
but the liberal deviseth liberal things and by liberal things shall he stand
rise up ye women that are at ease hear my voice ye careless daughters give ear unto my speech
many days and years shall ye be troubled ye careless women for the vintage shall fail the gathering shall not come
tremble ye women that are at ease be troubled ye careless ones strip you and make you bare and gird sackcloth upon your loins
they shall lament for the teats for the pleasant fields for the fruitful vine
upon the land of my people shall come up thorns and briers yea upon all the houses of joy in the joyous city
because the palaces shall be forsaken the multitude of the city shall be left the forts and towers shall be for dens for ever a joy of wild asses a pasture of flocks
until the spirit be poured upon us from on high and the wilderness be a fruitful field and the fruitful field be counted for a forest
then judgment shall dwell in the wilderness and righteousness remain in the fruitful field
and the work of righteousness shall be peace and the effect of righteousness quietness and assurance for ever
and my people shall dwell in a peaceable habitation and in sure dwellings and in quiet resting places
when it shall hail coming down on the forest and the city shall be low in a low place
blessed are ye that sow beside all waters that send forth thither the feet of the ox and the ass
woe to thee that spoilest and thou wast not spoiled and dealest treacherously and they dealt not treacherously with thee when thou shalt cease to spoil thou shalt be spoiled and when thou shalt make an end to deal treacherously they shall deal treacherously with thee
o lord be gracious unto us we have waited for thee be thou their arm every morning our salvation also in the time of trouble
at the noise of the tumult the people fled at the lifting up of thyself the nations were scattered
and your spoil shall be gathered like the gathering of the caterpiller as the running to and fro of locusts shall he run upon them
the lord is exalted for he dwelleth on high he hath filled zion with judgment and righteousness
and wisdom and knowledge shall be the stability of thy times and strength of salvation the fear of the lord is his treasure
behold their valiant ones shall cry without the ambassadors of peace shall weep bitterly
the highways lie waste the wayfaring man ceaseth he hath broken the covenant he hath despised the cities he regardeth no man
the earth mourneth and languisheth lebanon is ashamed and hewn down sharon is like a wilderness and bashan and carmel shake off their fruits
now will i rise saith the lord now will i be exalted now will i lift up myself
ye shall conceive chaff ye shall bring forth stubble your breath as fire shall devour you
and the people shall be as the burnings of lime as thorns cut up shall they be burned in the fire
hear ye that are far off what i have done and ye that are near acknowledge my might
the sinners in zion are afraid fearfulness hath surprised the hypocrites who among us shall dwell with the devouring fire who among us shall dwell with everlasting burnings
he that walketh righteously and speaketh uprightly he that despiseth the gain of oppressions that shaketh his hands from holding of bribes that stoppeth his ears from hearing of blood and shutteth his eyes from seeing evil
he shall dwell on high his place of defence shall be the munitions of rocks bread shall be given him his waters shall be sure
thine eyes shall see the king in his beauty they shall behold the land that is very far off
thine heart shall meditate terror where is the scribe where is the receiver where is he that counted the towers
thou shalt not see a fierce people a people of a deeper speech than thou canst perceive of a stammering tongue that thou canst not understand
look upon zion the city of our solemnities thine eyes shall see jerusalem a quiet habitation a tabernacle that shall not be taken down not one of the stakes thereof shall ever be removed neither shall any of the cords thereof be broken
but there the glorious lord will be unto us a place of broad rivers and streams wherein shall go no galley with oars neither shall gallant ship pass thereby
for the lord is our judge the lord is our lawgiver the lord is our king he will save us
thy tacklings are loosed they could not well strengthen their mast they could not spread the sail then is the prey of a great spoil divided the lame take the prey
and the inhabitant shall not say i am sick the people that dwell therein shall be forgiven their iniquity
come near ye nations to hear and hearken ye people let the earth hear and all that is therein the world and all things that come forth of it
for the indignation of the lord is upon all nations and his fury upon all their armies he hath utterly destroyed them he hath delivered them to the slaughter
their slain also shall be cast out and their stink shall come up out of their carcases and the mountains shall be melted with their blood
and all the host of heaven shall be dissolved and the heavens shall be rolled together as a scroll and all their host shall fall down as the leaf falleth off from the vine and as a falling fig from the fig tree
for my sword shall be bathed in heaven behold it shall come down upon idumea and upon the people of my curse to judgment
the sword of the lord is filled with blood it is made fat with fatness and with the blood of lambs and goats with the fat of the kidneys of rams for the lord hath a sacrifice in bozrah and a great slaughter in the land of idumea
and the unicorns shall come down with them and the bullocks with the bulls and their land shall be soaked with blood and their dust made fat with fatness
for it is the day of the lord's vengeance and the year of recompences for the controversy of zion
and the streams thereof shall be turned into pitch and the dust thereof into brimstone and the land thereof shall become burning pitch
it shall not be quenched night nor day the smoke thereof shall go up for ever from generation to generation it shall lie waste none shall pass through it for ever and ever
but the cormorant and the bittern shall possess it the owl also and the raven shall dwell in it and he shall stretch out upon it the line of confusion and the stones of emptiness
they shall call the nobles thereof to the kingdom but none shall be there and all her princes shall be nothing
and thorns shall come up in her palaces nettles and brambles in the fortresses thereof and it shall be an habitation of dragons and a court for owls
the wild beasts of the desert shall also meet with the wild beasts of the island and the satyr shall cry to his fellow the screech owl also shall rest there and find for herself a place of rest
there shall the great owl make her nest and lay and hatch and gather under her shadow there shall the vultures also be gathered every one with her mate
seek ye out of the book of the lord and read no one of these shall fail none shall want her mate for my mouth it hath commanded and his spirit it hath gathered them
and he hath cast the lot for them and his hand hath divided it unto them by line they shall possess it for ever from generation to generation shall they dwell therein
the wilderness and the solitary place shall be glad for them and the desert shall rejoice and blossom as the rose
it shall blossom abundantly and rejoice even with joy and singing the glory of lebanon shall be given unto it the excellency of carmel and sharon they shall see the glory of the lord and the excellency of our god
strengthen ye the weak hands and confirm the feeble knees
say to them that are of a fearful heart be strong fear not behold your god will come with vengeance even god with a recompence he will come and save you
then the eyes of the blind shall be opened and the ears of the deaf shall be unstopped
then shall the lame man leap as an hart and the tongue of the dumb sing for in the wilderness shall waters break out and streams in the desert
and the parched ground shall become a pool and the thirsty land springs of water in the habitation of dragons where each lay shall be grass with reeds and rushes
and an highway shall be there and a way and it shall be called the way of holiness the unclean shall not pass over it but it shall be for those the wayfaring men though fools shall not err therein
no lion shall be there nor any ravenous beast shall go up thereon it shall not be found there but the redeemed shall walk there
and the ransomed of the lord shall return and come to zion with songs and everlasting joy upon their heads they shall obtain joy and gladness and sorrow and sighing shall flee away
now it came to pass in the fourteenth year of king hezekiah that sennacherib king of assyria came up against all the defenced cities of judah and took them
and the king of assyria sent rabshakeh from lachish to jerusalem unto king hezekiah with a great army and he stood by the conduit of the upper pool in the highway of the fuller's field
then came forth unto him eliakim hilkiah's son which was over the house and shebna the scribe and joah asaph's son the recorder
and rabshakeh said unto them say ye now to hezekiah thus saith the great king the king of assyria what confidence is this wherein thou trustest
i say sayest thou but they are but vain words i have counsel and strength for war now on whom dost thou trust that thou rebellest against me
lo thou trustest in the staff of this broken reed on egypt whereon if a man lean it will go into his hand and pierce it so is pharaoh king of egypt to all that trust in him
but if thou say to me we trust in the lord our god is it not he whose high places and whose altars hezekiah hath taken away and said to judah and to jerusalem ye shall worship before this altar
now therefore give pledges i pray thee to my master the king of assyria and i will give thee two thousand horses if thou be able on thy part to set riders upon them
how then wilt thou turn away the face of one captain of the least of my master's servants and put thy trust on egypt for chariots and for horsemen
and am i now come up without the lord against this land to destroy it the lord said unto me go up against this land and destroy it
then said eliakim and shebna and joah unto rabshakeh speak i pray thee unto thy servants in the syrian language for we understand it and speak not to us in the jews language in the ears of the people that are on the wall
but rabshakeh said hath my master sent me to thy master and to thee to speak these words hath he not sent me to the men that sit upon the wall that they may eat their own dung and drink their own piss with you
then rabshakeh stood and cried with a loud voice in the jews language and said hear ye the words of the great king the king of assyria
thus saith the king let not hezekiah deceive you for he shall not be able to deliver you
neither let hezekiah make you trust in the lord saying the lord will surely deliver us this city shall not be delivered into the hand of the king of assyria
hearken not to hezekiah for thus saith the king of assyria make an agreement with me by a present and come out to me and eat ye every one of his vine and every one of his fig tree and drink ye every one the waters of his own cistern
until i come and take you away to a land like your own land a land of corn and wine a land of bread and vineyards
beware lest hezekiah persuade you saying the lord will deliver us hath any of the gods of the nations delivered his land out of the hand of the king of assyria
where are the gods of hamath and arphad where are the gods of sepharvaim and have they delivered samaria out of my hand
who are they among all the gods of these lands that have delivered their land out of my hand that the lord should deliver jerusalem out of my hand
but they held their peace and answered him not a word for the king's commandment was saying answer him not
then came eliakim the son of hilkiah that was over the household and shebna the scribe and joah the son of asaph the recorder to hezekiah with their clothes rent and told him the words of rabshakeh
and it came to pass when king hezekiah heard it that he rent his clothes and covered himself with sackcloth and went into the house of the lord
and he sent eliakim who was over the household and shebna the scribe and the elders of the priests covered with sackcloth unto isaiah the prophet the son of amoz
and they said unto him thus saith hezekiah this day is a day of trouble and of rebuke and of blasphemy for the children are come to the birth and there is not strength to bring forth
it may be the lord thy god will hear the words of rabshakeh whom the king of assyria his master hath sent to reproach the living god and will reprove the words which the lord thy god hath heard wherefore lift up thy prayer for the remnant that is left
so the servants of king hezekiah came to isaiah
and isaiah said unto them thus shall ye say unto your master thus saith the lord be not afraid of the words that thou hast heard wherewith the servants of the king of assyria have blasphemed me
behold i will send a blast upon him and he shall hear a rumour and return to his own land and i will cause him to fall by the sword in his own land
so rabshakeh returned and found the king of assyria warring against libnah for he had heard that he was departed from lachish
and he heard say concerning tirhakah king of ethiopia he is come forth to make war with thee and when he heard it he sent messengers to hezekiah saying
thus shall ye speak to hezekiah king of judah saying let not thy god in whom thou trustest deceive thee saying jerusalem shall not be given into the hand of the king of assyria
behold thou hast heard what the kings of assyria have done to all lands by destroying them utterly and shalt thou be delivered
have the gods of the nations delivered them which my fathers have destroyed as gozan and haran and rezeph and the children of eden which were in telassar
where is the king of hamath and the king of arphad and the king of the city of sepharvaim hena and ivah
and hezekiah received the letter from the hand of the messengers and read it and hezekiah went up unto the house of the lord and spread it before the lord
and hezekiah prayed unto the lord saying
o lord of hosts god of israel that dwellest between the cherubims thou art the god even thou alone of all the kingdoms of the earth thou hast made heaven and earth
incline thine ear o lord and hear open thine eyes o lord and see and hear all the words of sennacherib which hath sent to reproach the living god
of a truth lord the kings of assyria have laid waste all the nations and their countries
and have cast their gods into the fire for they were no gods but the work of men's hands wood and stone therefore they have destroyed them
now therefore o lord our god save us from his hand that all the kingdoms of the earth may know that thou art the lord even thou only
then isaiah the son of amoz sent unto hezekiah saying thus saith the lord god of israel whereas thou hast prayed to me against sennacherib king of assyria
this is the word which the lord hath spoken concerning him the virgin the daughter of zion hath despised thee and laughed thee to scorn the daughter of jerusalem hath shaken her head at thee
whom hast thou reproached and blasphemed and against whom hast thou exalted thy voice and lifted up thine eyes on high even against the holy one of israel
by thy servants hast thou reproached the lord and hast said by the multitude of my chariots am i come up to the height of the mountains to the sides of lebanon and i will cut down the tall cedars thereof and the choice fir trees thereof and i will enter into the height of his border and the forest of his carmel
i have digged and drunk water and with the sole of my feet have i dried up all the rivers of the besieged places
hast thou not heard long ago how i have done it and of ancient times that i have formed it now have i brought it to pass that thou shouldest be to lay waste defenced cities into ruinous heaps
therefore their inhabitants were of small power they were dismayed and confounded they were as the grass of the field and as the green herb as the grass on the housetops and as corn blasted before it be grown up
but i know thy abode and thy going out and thy coming in and thy rage against me
because thy rage against me and thy tumult is come up into mine ears therefore will i put my hook in thy nose and my bridle in thy lips and i will turn thee back by the way by which thou camest
and this shall be a sign unto thee ye shall eat this year such as groweth of itself and the second year that which springeth of the same and in the third year sow ye and reap and plant vineyards and eat the fruit thereof
and the remnant that is escaped of the house of judah shall again take root downward and bear fruit upward
for out of jerusalem shall go forth a remnant and they that escape out of mount zion the zeal of the lord of hosts shall do this
therefore thus saith the lord concerning the king of assyria he shall not come into this city nor shoot an arrow there nor come before it with shields nor cast a bank against it
by the way that he came by the same shall he return and shall not come into this city saith the lord
for i will defend this city to save it for mine own sake and for my servant david's sake
then the angel of the lord went forth and smote in the camp of the assyrians a hundred and fourscore and five thousand and when they arose early in the morning behold they were all dead corpses
so sennacherib king of assyria departed and went and returned and dwelt at nineveh
and it came to pass as he was worshipping in the house of nisroch his god that adrammelech and sharezer his sons smote him with the sword and they escaped into the land of armenia and esarhaddon his son reigned in his stead
in those days was hezekiah sick unto death and isaiah the prophet the son of amoz came unto him and said unto him thus saith the lord set thine house in order for thou shalt die and not live
then hezekiah turned his face toward the wall and prayed unto the lord
and said remember now o lord i beseech thee how i have walked before thee in truth and with a perfect heart and have done that which is good in thy sight and hezekiah wept sore
then came the word of the lord to isaiah saying
go and say to hezekiah thus saith the lord the god of david thy father i have heard thy prayer i have seen thy tears behold i will add unto thy days fifteen years
and i will deliver thee and this city out of the hand of the king of assyria and i will defend this city
and this shall be a sign unto thee from the lord that the lord will do this thing that he hath spoken
