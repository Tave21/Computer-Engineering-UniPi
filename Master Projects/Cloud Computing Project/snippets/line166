 and as the president of my kingdom will
 appear there for a man speak not against it
 i will not stay behind
domitius enobarbus nay i have done
 here comes the emperor
 enter mark antony and canidius
mark antony is it not strange canidius
 that from tarentum and brundusium
 he could so quickly cut the ionian sea
 and take in toryne you have heard on't sweet
cleopatra celerity is never more admired
 than by the negligent
mark antony a good rebuke
 which might have well becomed the best of men
 to taunt at slackness canidius we
 will fight with him by sea
cleopatra by sea what else
canidius why will my lord do so
mark antony for that he dares us to't
domitius enobarbus so hath my lord dared him to single fight
canidius ay and to wage this battle at pharsalia
 where caesar fought with pompey but these offers
 which serve not for his vantage be shakes off
 and so should you
domitius enobarbus your ships are not well mann'd
 your mariners are muleters reapers people
 ingross'd by swift impress in caesar's fleet
 are those that often have gainst pompey fought
 their ships are yare yours heavy no disgrace
 shall fall you for refusing him at sea
 being prepared for land
mark antony by sea by sea
domitius enobarbus most worthy sir you therein throw away
 the absolute soldiership you have by land
 distract your army which doth most consist
 of warmark'd footmen leave unexecuted
 your own renowned knowledge quite forego
 the way which promises assurance and
 give up yourself merely to chance and hazard
 from firm security
mark antony i'll fight at sea
cleopatra i have sixty sails caesar none better
mark antony our overplus of shipping will we burn
 and with the rest fullmann'd from the head of actium
 beat the approaching caesar but if we fail
 we then can do't at land
 enter a messenger
 thy business
messenger the news is true my lord he is descried
 caesar has taken toryne
mark antony can he be there in person tis impossible
 strange that power should be canidius
 our nineteen legions thou shalt hold by land
 and our twelve thousand horse we'll to our ship
 away my thetis
 enter a soldier
 how now worthy soldier
soldier o noble emperor do not fight by sea
 trust not to rotten planks do you misdoubt
 this sword and these my wounds let the egyptians
 and the phoenicians go aducking we
 have used to conquer standing on the earth
 and fighting foot to foot
mark antony well well away
 exeunt mark antony queen cleopatra and domitius
 enobarbus
soldier by hercules i think i am i the right
canidius soldier thou art but his whole action grows
 not in the power on't so our leader's led
 and we are women's men
soldier you keep by land
 the legions and the horse whole do you not
canidius marcus octavius marcus justeius
 publicola and caelius are for sea
 but we keep whole by land this speed of caesar's
 carries beyond belief
soldier while he was yet in rome
 his power went out in such distractions as
 beguiled all spies
canidius who's his lieutenant hear you
soldier they say one taurus
canidius well i know the man
 enter a messenger
messenger the emperor calls canidius
canidius with news the time's with labour and throes forth
 each minute some
 exeunt
 antony and cleopatra
act iii
scene viii a plain near actium
 enter octavius caesar and taurus with his army marching
octavius caesar taurus
taurus my lord
octavius caesar strike not by land keep whole provoke not battle
 till we have done at sea do not exceed
 the prescript of this scroll our fortune lies
 upon this jump
 exeunt
 antony and cleopatra
act iii
scene ix another part of the plain
 enter mark antony and domitius enobarbus
mark antony set we our squadrons on yond side o the hill
 in eye of caesar's battle from which place
 we may the number of the ships behold
 and so proceed accordingly
 exeunt
 antony and cleopatra
act iii
scene x another part of the plain
 canidius marcheth with his land army one way over
 the stage and taurus the lieutenant of octavius
 caesar the other way after their going in is
 heard the noise of a seafight
 alarum enter domitius enobarbus
domitius enobarbus naught naught all naught i can behold no longer
 the antoniad the egyptian admiral
 with all their sixty fly and turn the rudder
 to see't mine eyes are blasted
 enter scarus
scarus gods and goddesses
 all the whole synod of them
domitius enobarbus what's thy passion
scarus the greater cantle of the world is lost
 with very ignorance we have kiss'd away
 kingdoms and provinces
domitius enobarbus how appears the fight
scarus on our side like the token'd pestilence
 where death is sure yon ribaudred nag of egypt
 whom leprosy o'ertakei the midst o the fight
 when vantage like a pair of twins appear'd
 both as the same or rather ours the elder
 the breese upon her like a cow in june
 hoists sails and flies
domitius enobarbus that i beheld
 mine eyes did sicken at the sight and could not
 endure a further view
scarus she once being loof'd
 the noble ruin of her magic antony
 claps on his seawing and like a doting mallard
 leaving the fight in height flies after her
 i never saw an action of such shame
 experience manhood honour ne'er before
 did violate so itself
domitius enobarbus alack alack
 enter canidius
canidius our fortune on the sea is out of breath
 and sinks most lamentably had our general
 been what he knew himself it had gone well
 o he has given example for our flight
 most grossly by his own
domitius enobarbus ay are you thereabouts
 why then good night indeed
canidius toward peloponnesus are they fled
scarus tis easy to't and there i will attend
 what further comes
canidius to caesar will i render
 my legions and my horse six kings already
 show me the way of yielding
domitius enobarbus i'll yet follow
 the wounded chance of antony though my reason
 sits in the wind against me
 exeunt
 antony and cleopatra
act iii
scene xi alexandria cleopatra's palace
 enter mark antony with attendants
mark antony hark the land bids me tread no more upon't
 it is ashamed to bear me friends come hither
 i am so lated in the world that i
 have lost my way for ever i have a ship
 laden with gold take that divide it fly
 and make your peace with caesar
all fly not we
mark antony i have fled myself and have instructed cowards
 to run and show their shoulders friends be gone
 i have myself resolved upon a course
 which has no need of you be gone
 my treasure's in the harbour take it o
 i follow'd that i blush to look upon
 my very hairs do mutiny for the white
 reprove the brown for rashness and they them
 for fear and doting friends be gone you shall
 have letters from me to some friends that will
 sweep your way for you pray you look not sad
 nor make replies of loathness take the hint
 which my despair proclaims let that be left
 which leaves itself to the seaside straightway
 i will possess you of that ship and treasure
 leave me i pray a little pray you now
 nay do so for indeed i have lost command
 therefore i pray you i'll see you by and by
 sits down
 enter cleopatra led by charmian and iras eros
 following
eros nay gentle madam to him comfort him
iras do most dear queen
charmian do why what else
cleopatra let me sit down o juno
mark antony no no no no no
