mercutio nay an there were two such we should have none
 shortly for one would kill the other thou why
 thou wilt quarrel with a man that hath a hair more
 or a hair less in his beard than thou hast thou
 wilt quarrel with a man for cracking nuts having no
 other reason but because thou hast hazel eyes what
 eye but such an eye would spy out such a quarrel
 thy head is as fun of quarrels as an egg is full of
 meat and yet thy head hath been beaten as addle as
 an egg for quarrelling thou hast quarrelled with a
 man for coughing in the street because he hath
 wakened thy dog that hath lain asleep in the sun
 didst thou not fall out with a tailor for wearing
 his new doublet before easter with another for
 tying his new shoes with old riband and yet thou
 wilt tutor me from quarrelling

 hath been my kinsman o sweet juliet
 thy beauty hath made me effeminate
 and in my temper soften'd valour's steel
 reenter benvolio
benvolio o romeo romeo brave mercutio's dead
 that gallant spirit hath aspired the clouds
 which too untimely here did scorn the earth
romeo this day's black fate on more days doth depend
 this but begins the woe others must end
benvolio here comes the furious tybalt back again
romeo alive in triumph and mercutio slain
 away to heaven respective lenity
 and fireeyed fury be my conduct now
 reenter tybalt
 now tybalt take the villain back again
 that late thou gavest me for mercutio's soul
 is but a little way above our heads
 staying for thine to keep him company
 either thou or i or both must go with him
tybalt thou wretched boy that didst consort him here
 shalt with him hence
romeo this shall determine that
 they fight tybalt falls
benvolio romeo away be gone

 stand not amazed the prince will doom thee death
 if thou art taken hence be gone away

 exit romeo
 enter citizens &c
first citizen which way ran he that kill'd mercutio
 tybalt that murderer which way ran he
benvolio there lies that tybalt
first citizen up sir go with me
 i charge thee in the princes name obey
 enter prince attended montague capulet their
 wives and others
prince where are the vile beginners of this fray
benvolio o noble prince i can discover all
 the unlucky manage of this fatal brawl
 there lies the man slain by young romeo
 that slew thy kinsman brave mercutio
lady capulet tybalt my cousin o my brother's child
 o prince o cousin husband o the blood is spilt
 o my dear kinsman prince as thou art true
 for blood of ours shed blood of montague
 o cousin cousin
prince benvolio who began this bloody fray
benvolio tybalt here slain whom romeo's hand did slay
 romeo that spoke him fair bade him bethink
 how nice the quarrel was and urged withal
 your high displeasure all this uttered
 with gentle breath calm look knees humbly bow'd
 could not take truce with the unruly spleen
 of tybalt deaf to peace but that he tilts
 with piercing steel at bold mercutio's breast
 who all as hot turns deadly point to point
 and with a martial scorn with one hand beats
 cold death aside and with the other sends
 it back to tybalt whose dexterity
 retorts it romeo he cries aloud
 hold friends friends part and swifter than
 his tongue
 his agile arm beats down their fatal points
 and twixt them rushes underneath whose arm
 an envious thrust from tybalt hit the life
 of stout mercutio and then tybalt fled
 but by and by comes back to romeo
 who had but newly entertain'd revenge
 and to t they go like lightning for ere i
 could draw to part them was stout tybalt slain
 and as he fell did romeo turn and fly
 this is the truth or let benvolio die
lady capulet he is a kinsman to the montague
 affection makes him false he speaks not true
 some twenty of them fought in this black strife
 and all those twenty could but kill one life
 i beg for justice which thou prince must give
 romeo slew tybalt romeo must not live
prince romeo slew him he slew mercutio
 who now the price of his dear blood doth owe
montague not romeo prince he was mercutio's friend
 his fault concludes but what the law should end
 the life of tybalt
prince and for that offence
 immediately we do exile him hence
 i have an interest in your hate's proceeding
 my blood for your rude brawls doth lie ableeding
 but i'll amerce you with so strong a fine
 that you shall all repent the loss of mine
 i will be deaf to pleading and excuses
