 why then thou art an executioner
gloucester thy son i kill'd for his presumption
king henry vi hadst thou been kill'd when first thou didst presume
 thou hadst not lived to kill a son of mine
 and thus i prophesy that many a thousand
 which now mistrust no parcel of my fear
 and many an old man's sigh and many a widow's
 and many an orphan's waterstanding eye
 men for their sons wives for their husbands
 and orphans for their parents timeless death
 shall rue the hour that ever thou wast born
 the owl shriek'd at thy birthan evil sign
 the nightcrow cried aboding luckless time
 dogs howl'd and hideous tempest shook down trees
 the raven rook'd her on the chimney's top
 and chattering pies in dismal discords sung
 thy mother felt more than a mother's pain
 and yet brought forth less than a mother's hope
 to wit an indigested and deformed lump
 not like the fruit of such a goodly tree
 teeth hadst thou in thy head when thou wast born
 to signify thou camest to bite the world
 and if the rest be true which i have heard
 thou camest
gloucester i'll hear no more die prophet in thy speech
 stabs him
 for this amongst the rest was i ordain'd
king henry vi ay and for much more slaughter after this
 god forgive my sins and pardon thee
 dies
gloucester what will the aspiring blood of lancaster
 sink in the ground i thought it would have mounted
 see how my sword weeps for the poor king's death
 o may such purple tears be alway shed
 from those that wish the downfall of our house
 if any spark of life be yet remaining
 down down to hell and say i sent thee thither
 stabs him again
 i that have neither pity love nor fear
 indeed tis true that henry told me of
 for i have often heard my mother say
 i came into the world with my legs forward
 had i not reason think ye to make haste
 and seek their ruin that usurp'd our right
 the midwife wonder'd and the women cried
 o jesus bless us he is born with teeth'
 and so i was which plainly signified
 that i should snarl and bite and play the dog
 then since the heavens have shaped my body so
 let hell make crook'd my mind to answer it
 i have no brother i am like no brother
 and this word love which graybeards call divine
 be resident in men like one another
 and not in me i am myself alone
 clarence beware thou keep'st me from the light
 but i will sort a pitchy day for thee
 for i will buz abroad such prophecies
 that edward shall be fearful of his life
 and then to purge his fear i'll be thy death
 king henry and the prince his son are gone
 clarence thy turn is next and then the rest
 counting myself but bad till i be best
 i'll throw thy body in another room
 and triumph henry in thy day of doom
 exit with the body

scene vii london the palace
 flourish enter king edward iv queen elizabeth
 clarence gloucester hastings a nurse with the
 young prince and attendants
king edward iv once more we sit in england's royal throne
 repurchased with the blood of enemies
 what valiant foemen like to autumn's corn
 have we mow'd down in tops of all their pride
 three dukes of somerset threefold renown'd
 for hardy and undoubted champions
 two cliffords as the father and the son
 and two northumberlands two braver men
 ne'er spurr'd their coursers at the trumpet's sound
 with them the two brave bears warwick and montague
 that in their chains fetter'd the kingly lion
 and made the forest tremble when they roar'd
 thus have we swept suspicion from our seat
 and made our footstool of security
 come hither bess and let me kiss my boy
 young ned for thee thine uncles and myself
 have in our armours watch'd the winter's night
 went all afoot in summer's scalding heat
 that thou mightst repossess the crown in peace
 and of our labours thou shalt reap the gain
gloucester aside i'll blast his harvest if your head were laid
 for yet i am not look'd on in the world
 this shoulder was ordain'd so thick to heave
 and heave it shall some weight or break my back
 work thou the wayand thou shalt execute
king edward iv clarence and gloucester love my lovely queen
 and kiss your princely nephew brothers both
clarence the duty that i owe unto your majesty
 i seal upon the lips of this sweet babe
queen elizabeth thanks noble clarence worthy brother thanks
gloucester and that i love the tree from whence thou sprang'st
 witness the loving kiss i give the fruit
 aside to say the truth so judas kiss'd his master
 and cried all hail when as he meant all harm
king edward iv now am i seated as my soul delights
 having my country's peace and brothers loves
clarence what will your grace have done with margaret
 reignier her father to the king of france
 hath pawn'd the sicils and jerusalem
 and hither have they sent it for her ransom
king edward iv away with her and waft her hence to france
 and now what rests but that we spend the time
 with stately triumphs mirthful comic shows
 such as befits the pleasure of the court
 sound drums and trumpets farewell sour annoy
 for here i hope begins our lasting joy
