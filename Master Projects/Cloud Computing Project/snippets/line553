 that knows his valour and knows not his fear
 that loves his mistress more than in confession
 with truant vows to her own lips he loves
 and dare avow her beauty and her worth
 in other arms than hersto him this challenge
 hector in view of trojans and of greeks
 shall make it good or do his best to do it
 he hath a lady wiser fairer truer
 than ever greek did compass in his arms
 and will tomorrow with his trumpet call
 midway between your tents and walls of troy
 to rouse a grecian that is true in love
 if any come hector shall honour him
 if none he'll say in troy when he retires
 the grecian dames are sunburnt and not worth
 the splinter of a lance even so much
agamemnon this shall be told our lovers lord aeneas
 if none of them have soul in such a kind
 we left them all at home but we are soldiers
 and may that soldier a mere recreant prove
 that means not hath not or is not in love
 if then one is or hath or means to be
 that one meets hector if none else i am he
nestor tell him of nestor one that was a man
 when hector's grandsire suck'd he is old now
 but if there be not in our grecian host
 one noble man that hath one spark of fire
 to answer for his love tell him from me
 i'll hide my silver beard in a gold beaver
 and in my vantbrace put this wither'd brawn
 and meeting him will tell him that my lady
 was fairer than his grandam and as chaste
 as may be in the world his youth in flood
 i'll prove this truth with my three drops of blood
aeneas now heavens forbid such scarcity of youth
ulysses amen
agamemnon fair lord aeneas let me touch your hand
 to our pavilion shall i lead you sir
 achilles shall have word of this intent
 so shall each lord of greece from tent to tent
 yourself shall feast with us before you go
 and find the welcome of a noble foe
 exeunt all but ulysses and nestor
ulysses nestor
nestor what says ulysses
ulysses i have a young conception in my brain
 be you my time to bring it to some shape
nestor what is't
ulysses this tis
 blunt wedges rive hard knots the seeded pride
 that hath to this maturity blown up
 in rank achilles must or now be cropp'd
 or shedding breed a nursery of like evil
 to overbulk us all
nestor well and how
ulysses this challenge that the gallant hector sends
 however it is spread in general name
 relates in purpose only to achilles
nestor the purpose is perspicuous even as substance
 whose grossness little characters sum up
 and in the publication make no strain
 but that achilles were his brain as barren
 as banks of libyathough apollo knows
 tis dry enoughwill with great speed of judgment
 ay with celerity find hector's purpose
 pointing on him
ulysses and wake him to the answer think you
nestor yes tis most meet whom may you else oppose
 that can from hector bring his honour off
 if not achilles though't be a sportful combat
 yet in the trial much opinion dwells
 for here the trojans taste our dear'st repute
 with their finest palate and trust to me ulysses
 our imputation shall be oddly poised
 in this wild action for the success
 although particular shall give a scantling
 of good or bad unto the general
 and in such indexes although small pricks
 to their subsequent volumes there is seen
 the baby figure of the giant mass
 of things to come at large it is supposed
 he that meets hector issues from our choice
 and choice being mutual act of all our souls
 makes merit her election and doth boil
 as twere from us all a man distill'd
 out of our virtues who miscarrying
 what heart receives from hence the conquering part
 to steel a strong opinion to themselves
 which entertain'd limbs are his instruments
 in no less working than are swords and bows
 directive by the limbs
ulysses give pardon to my speech
 therefore tis meet achilles meet not hector
 let us like merchants show our foulest wares
 and think perchance they'll sell if not
 the lustre of the better yet to show
 shall show the better do not consent
 that ever hector and achilles meet
 for both our honour and our shame in this
 are dogg'd with two strange followers
nestor i see them not with my old eyes what are they
ulysses what glory our achilles shares from hector
 were he not proud we all should share with him
 but he already is too insolent
 and we were better parch in afric sun
 than in the pride and salt scorn of his eyes
 should he scape hector fair if he were foil'd
 why then we did our main opinion crush
 in taint of our best man no make a lottery
 and by device let blockish ajax draw
 the sort to fight with hector among ourselves
 give him allowance for the better man
 for that will physic the great myrmidon
 who broils in loud applause and make him fall
 his crest that prouder than blue iris bends
 if the dull brainless ajax come safe off
 we'll dress him up in voices if he fail
 yet go we under our opinion still
 that we have better men but hit or miss
 our project's life this shape of sense assumes
 ajax employ'd plucks down achilles plumes
nestor ulysses
 now i begin to relish thy advice
 and i will give a taste of it forthwith
 to agamemnon go we to him straight
 two curs shall tame each other pride alone
 must tarre the mastiffs on as twere their bone
 exeunt
 troilus and cressida

 the scratching of thee i would make thee the
 loathsomest scab in greece when thou art forth in
 the incursions thou strikest as slow as another
ajax i say the proclamation
thersites thou grumblest and railest every hour on achilles
 and thou art as full of envy at his greatness as
 cerberus is at proserpine's beauty ay that thou
 barkest at him
ajax mistress thersites
thersites thou shouldest strike him
ajax cobloaf
thersites he would pun thee into shivers with his fist as a
 sailor breaks a biscuit
ajax beating him you whoreson cur
thersites do do
ajax thou stool for a witch
thersites ay do do thou soddenwitted lord thou hast no
 more brain than i have in mine elbows an assinego
 may tutor thee thou scurvyvaliant ass thou art
 here but to thrash trojans and thou art bought and
 sold among those of any wit like a barbarian slave
 if thou use to beat me i will begin at thy heel and
 tell what thou art by inches thou thing of no
 bowels thou
ajax you dog

achilles so i do what's the matter
thersites nay but regard him well
achilles well why i do so
thersites but yet you look not well upon him for whosoever you
 take him to be he is ajax
achilles i know that fool
thersites ay but that fool knows not himself
ajax therefore i beat thee
thersites lo lo lo lo what modicums of wit he utters his
