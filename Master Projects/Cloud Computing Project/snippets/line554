 exeunt
 troilus and cressida
act ii
scene ii troy a room in priam's palace
 enter priam hector troilus paris and helenus
priam after so many hours lives speeches spent
 thus once again says nestor from the greeks
 deliver helen and all damage else
 as honour loss of time travail expense
 wounds friends and what else dear that is consumed
 in hot digestion of this cormorant war
 shall be struck off hector what say you to't
hector though no man lesser fears the greeks than i
 as far as toucheth my particular
 yet dread priam
 there is no lady of more softer bowels
 more spongy to suck in the sense of fear
 more ready to cry out who knows what follows'
 than hector is the wound of peace is surety
 surety secure but modest doubt is call'd
 the beacon of the wise the tent that searches
 to the bottom of the worst let helen go
 since the first sword was drawn about this question
 every tithe soul mongst many thousand dismes
 hath been as dear as helen i mean of ours
 if we have lost so many tenths of ours
 to guard a thing not ours nor worth to us
 had it our name the value of one ten
 what merit's in that reason which denies
 the yielding of her up
troilus fie fie my brother
 weigh you the worth and honour of a king
 so great as our dread father in a scale
 of common ounces will you with counters sum
 the past proportion of his infinite
 and buckle in a waist most fathomless
 with spans and inches so diminutive
 as fears and reasons fie for godly shame
helenus no marvel though you bite so sharp at reasons
 you are so empty of them should not our father
 bear the great sway of his affairs with reasons
 because your speech hath none that tells him so
troilus you are for dreams and slumbers brother priest
 you fur your gloves with reason here are
 your reasons
 you know an enemy intends you harm
 you know a sword employ'd is perilous
 and reason flies the object of all harm
 who marvels then when helenus beholds
 a grecian and his sword if he do set
 the very wings of reason to his heels
 and fly like chidden mercury from jove
 or like a star disorb'd nay if we talk of reason
 let's shut our gates and sleep manhood and honour
 should have harehearts would they but fat
 their thoughts
 with this cramm'd reason reason and respect
 make livers pale and lustihood deject
hector brother she is not worth what she doth cost
 the holding
troilus what is aught but as tis valued
hector but value dwells not in particular will
 it holds his estimate and dignity
 as well wherein tis precious of itself
 as in the prizer tis mad idolatry
 to make the service greater than the god
 and the will dotes that is attributive
 to what infectiously itself affects
 without some image of the affected merit
troilus i take today a wife and my election
 is led on in the conduct of my will
 my will enkindled by mine eyes and ears
 two traded pilots twixt the dangerous shores
 of will and judgment how may i avoid
 although my will distaste what it elected
 the wife i chose there can be no evasion
 to blench from this and to stand firm by honour
 we turn not back the silks upon the merchant
 when we have soil'd them nor the remainder viands
 we do not throw in unrespective sieve
 because we now are full it was thought meet
 paris should do some vengeance on the greeks
 your breath of full consent bellied his sails
 the seas and winds old wranglers took a truce
 and did him service he touch'd the ports desired
 and for an old aunt whom the greeks held captive
 he brought a grecian queen whose youth and freshness
 wrinkles apollo's and makes stale the morning
 why keep we her the grecians keep our aunt
 is she worth keeping why she is a pearl
 whose price hath launch'd above a thousand ships
 and turn'd crown'd kings to merchants
 if you'll avouch twas wisdom paris went
 as you must needs for you all cried go go'
 if you'll confess he brought home noble prize
 as you must needs for you all clapp'd your hands
 and cried inestimable'why do you now
 the issue of your proper wisdoms rate
 and do a deed that fortune never did
 beggar the estimation which you prized
 richer than sea and land o theft most base
 that we have stol'n what we do fear to keep
 but thieves unworthy of a thing so stol'n
 that in their country did them that disgrace
 we fear to warrant in our native place
cassandra within cry trojans cry
priam what noise what shriek is this
troilus tis our mad sister i do know her voice
cassandra within cry trojans
hector it is cassandra
 enter cassandra raving
cassandra cry trojans cry lend me ten thousand eyes
 and i will fill them with prophetic tears
hector peace sister peace
cassandra virgins and boys midage and wrinkled eld
 soft infancy that nothing canst but cry
 add to my clamours let us pay betimes
 a moiety of that mass of moan to come
 cry trojans cry practise your eyes with tears
 troy must not be nor goodly ilion stand
 our firebrand brother paris burns us all
 cry trojans cry a helen and a woe
 cry cry troy burns or else let helen go
 exit
hector now youthful troilus do not these high strains
 of divination in our sister work
 some touches of remorse or is your blood
 so madly hot that no discourse of reason
 nor fear of bad success in a bad cause
 can qualify the same
troilus why brother hector
 we may not think the justness of each act
 such and no other than event doth form it
 nor once deject the courage of our minds
 because cassandra's mad her brainsick raptures
 cannot distaste the goodness of a quarrel
 which hath our several honours all engaged
 to make it gracious for my private part
