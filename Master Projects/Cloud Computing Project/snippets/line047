1ki1911 and he said go forth and stand upon the mount before the lord and behold the lord passed by and a great and strong wind rent the mountains and brake in pieces the rocks before the lord but the lord was not in the wind and after the wind an earthquake but the lord was not in the earthquake
1ki1912 and after the earthquake a fire but the lord was not in the fire and after the fire a still small voice
1ki1913 and it was so when elijah heard it that he wrapped his face in his mantle and went out and stood in the entering in of the cave and behold there came a voice unto him and said what doest thou here elijah
1ki1914 and he said i have been very jealous for the lord god of hosts because the children of israel have forsaken thy covenant thrown down thine altars and slain thy prophets with the sword and i even i only am left and they seek my life to take it away
1ki1915 and the lord said unto him go return on thy way to the wilderness of damascus and when thou comest anoint hazael to be king over syria
1ki1916 and jehu the son of nimshi shalt thou anoint to be king over israel and elisha the son of shaphat of abelmeholah shalt thou anoint to be prophet in thy room
1ki1917 and it shall come to pass that him that escapeth the sword of hazael shall jehu slay and him that escapeth from the sword of jehu shall elisha slay
1ki1918 yet i have left me seven thousand in israel all the knees which have not bowed unto baal and every mouth which hath not kissed him
1ki1919 so he departed thence and found elisha the son of shaphat who was plowing with twelve yoke of oxen before him and he with the twelfth and elijah passed by him and cast his mantle upon him
1ki1920 and he left the oxen and ran after elijah and said let me i pray thee kiss my father and my mother and then i will follow thee and he said unto him go back again for what have i done to thee
1ki1921 and he returned back from him and took a yoke of oxen and slew them and boiled their flesh with the instruments of the oxen and gave unto the people and they did eat then he arose and went after elijah and ministered unto him
1ki201 and benhadad the king of syria gathered all his host together and there were thirty and two kings with him and horses and chariots and he went up and besieged samaria and warred against it
1ki202 and he sent messengers to ahab king of israel into the city and said unto him thus saith benhadad
1ki203 thy silver and thy gold is mine thy wives also and thy children even the goodliest are mine
1ki204 and the king of israel answered and said my lord o king according to thy saying i am thine and all that i have
1ki205 and the messengers came again and said thus speaketh benhadad saying although i have sent unto thee saying thou shalt deliver me thy silver and thy gold and thy wives and thy children
1ki206 yet i will send my servants unto thee to morrow about this time and they shall search thine house and the houses of thy servants and it shall be that whatsoever is pleasant in thine eyes they shall put it in their hand and take it away
1ki207 then the king of israel called all the elders of the land and said mark i pray you and see how this man seeketh mischief for he sent unto me for my wives and for my children and for my silver and for my gold and i denied him not
1ki208 and all the elders and all the people said unto him hearken not unto him nor consent
1ki209 wherefore he said unto the messengers of benhadad tell my lord the king all that thou didst send for to thy servant at the first i will do but this thing i may not do and the messengers departed and brought him word again
1ki2010 and benhadad sent unto him and said the gods do so unto me and more also if the dust of samaria shall suffice for handfuls for all the people that follow me
1ki2011 and the king of israel answered and said tell him let not him that girdeth on his harness boast himself as he that putteth it off
1ki2012 and it came to pass when benhadad heard this message as he was drinking he and the kings in the pavilions that he said unto his servants set yourselves in array and they set themselves in array against the city
1ki2013 and behold there came a prophet unto ahab king of israel saying thus saith the lord hast thou seen all this great multitude behold i will deliver it into thine hand this day and thou shalt know that i am the lord
1ki2014 and ahab said by whom and he said thus saith the lord even by the young men of the princes of the provinces then he said who shall order the battle and he answered thou
1ki2015 then he numbered the young men of the princes of the provinces and they were two hundred and thirty two and after them he numbered all the people even all the children of israel being seven thousand
1ki2016 and they went out at noon but benhadad was drinking himself drunk in the pavilions he and the kings the thirty and two kings that helped him
1ki2017 and the young men of the princes of the provinces went out first and benhadad sent out and they told him saying there are men come out of samaria
1ki2018 and he said whether they be come out for peace take them alive or whether they be come out for war take them alive
1ki2019 so these young men of the princes of the provinces came out of the city and the army which followed them
1ki2020 and they slew every one his man and the syrians fled and israel pursued them and benhadad the king of syria escaped on an horse with the horsemen
1ki2021 and the king of israel went out and smote the horses and chariots and slew the syrians with a great slaughter
1ki2022 and the prophet came to the king of israel and said unto him go strengthen thyself and mark and see what thou doest for at the return of the year the king of syria will come up against thee
1ki2023 and the servants of the king of syria said unto him their gods are gods of the hills therefore they were stronger than we but let us fight against them in the plain and surely we shall be stronger than they
1ki2024 and do this thing take the kings away every man out of his place and put captains in their rooms
1ki2025 and number thee an army like the army that thou hast lost horse for horse and chariot for chariot and we will fight against them in the plain and surely we shall be stronger than they and he hearkened unto their voice and did so
1ki2026 and it came to pass at the return of the year that benhadad numbered the syrians and went up to aphek to fight against israel
1ki2027 and the children of israel were numbered and were all present and went against them and the children of israel pitched before them like two little flocks of kids but the syrians filled the country
1ki2028 and there came a man of god and spake unto the king of israel and said thus saith the lord because the syrians have said the lord is god of the hills but he is not god of the valleys therefore will i deliver all this great multitude into thine hand and ye shall know that i am the lord
1ki2029 and they pitched one over against the other seven days and so it was that in the seventh day the battle was joined and the children of israel slew of the syrians an hundred thousand footmen in one day
1ki2030 but the rest fled to aphek into the city and there a wall fell upon twenty and seven thousand of the men that were left and benhadad fled and came into the city into an inner chamber
1ki2031 and his servants said unto him behold now we have heard that the kings of the house of israel are merciful kings let us i pray thee put sackcloth on our loins and ropes upon our heads and go out to the king of israel peradventure he will save thy life
1ki2032 so they girded sackcloth on their loins and put ropes on their heads and came to the king of israel and said thy servant benhadad saith i pray thee let me live and he said is he yet alive he is my brother
1ki2033 now the men did diligently observe whether any thing would come from him and did hastily catch it and they said thy brother benhadad then he said go ye bring him then benhadad came forth to him and he caused him to come up into the chariot
1ki2034 and benhadad said unto him the cities which my father took from thy father i will restore and thou shalt make streets for thee in damascus as my father made in samaria then said ahab i will send thee away with this covenant so he made a covenant with him and sent him away
1ki2035 and a certain man of the sons of the prophets said unto his neighbour in the word of the lord smite me i pray thee and the man refused to smite him
1ki2036 then said he unto him because thou hast not obeyed the voice of the lord behold as soon as thou art departed from me a lion shall slay thee and as soon as he was departed from him a lion found him and slew him
1ki2037 then he found another man and said smite me i pray thee and the man smote him so that in smiting he wounded him
1ki2038 so the prophet departed and waited for the king by the way and disguised himself with ashes upon his face
1ki2039 and as the king passed by he cried unto the king and he said thy servant went out into the midst of the battle and behold a man turned aside and brought a man unto me and said keep this man if by any means he be missing then shall thy life be for his life or else thou shalt pay a talent of silver
1ki2040 and as thy servant was busy here and there he was gone and the king of israel said unto him so shall thy judgment be thyself hast decided it
1ki2041 and he hasted and took the ashes away from his face and the king of israel discerned him that he was of the prophets
1ki2042 and he said unto him thus saith the lord because thou hast let go out of thy hand a man whom i appointed to utter destruction therefore thy life shall go for his life and thy people for his people
1ki2043 and the king of israel went to his house heavy and displeased and came to samaria
1ki211 and it came to pass after these things that naboth the jezreelite had a vineyard which was in jezreel hard by the palace of ahab king of samaria
1ki212 and ahab spake unto naboth saying give me thy vineyard that i may have it for a garden of herbs because it is near unto my house and i will give thee for it a better vineyard than it or if it seem good to thee i will give thee the worth of it in money
1ki213 and naboth said to ahab the lord forbid it me that i should give the inheritance of my fathers unto thee
1ki214 and ahab came into his house heavy and displeased because of the word which naboth the jezreelite had spoken to him for he had said i will not give thee the inheritance of my fathers and he laid him down upon his bed and turned away his face and would eat no bread
1ki215 but jezebel his wife came to him and said unto him why is thy spirit so sad that thou eatest no bread
1ki216 and he said unto her because i spake unto naboth the jezreelite and said unto him give me thy vineyard for money or else if it please thee i will give thee another vineyard for it and he answered i will not give thee my vineyard
1ki217 and jezebel his wife said unto him dost thou now govern the kingdom of israel arise and eat bread and let thine heart be merry i will give thee the vineyard of naboth the jezreelite
1ki218 so she wrote letters in ahab's name and sealed them with his seal and sent the letters unto the elders and to the nobles that were in his city dwelling with naboth
1ki219 and she wrote in the letters saying proclaim a fast and set naboth on high among the people
1ki2110 and set two men sons of belial before him to bear witness against him saying thou didst blaspheme god and the king and then carry him out and stone him that he may die
1ki2111 and the men of his city even the elders and the nobles who were the inhabitants in his city did as jezebel had sent unto them and as it was written in the letters which she had sent unto them
1ki2112 they proclaimed a fast and set naboth on high among the people
1ki2113 and there came in two men children of belial and sat before him and the men of belial witnessed against him even against naboth in the presence of the people saying naboth did blaspheme god and the king then they carried him forth out of the city and stoned him with stones that he died
1ki2114 then they sent to jezebel saying naboth is stoned and is dead
1ki2115 and it came to pass when jezebel heard that naboth was stoned and was dead that jezebel said to ahab arise take possession of the vineyard of naboth the jezreelite which he refused to give thee for money for naboth is not alive but dead
1ki2116 and it came to pass when ahab heard that naboth was dead that ahab rose up to go down to the vineyard of naboth the jezreelite to take possession of it
1ki2117 and the word of the lord came to elijah the tishbite saying
1ki2118 arise go down to meet ahab king of israel which is in samaria behold he is in the vineyard of naboth whither he is gone down to possess it
1ki2119 and thou shalt speak unto him saying thus saith the lord hast thou killed and also taken possession and thou shalt speak unto him saying thus saith the lord in the place where dogs licked the blood of naboth shall dogs lick thy blood even thine
1ki2120 and ahab said to elijah hast thou found me o mine enemy and he answered i have found thee because thou hast sold thyself to work evil in the sight of the lord
1ki2121 behold i will bring evil upon thee and will take away thy posterity and will cut off from ahab him that pisseth against the wall and him that is shut up and left in israel
1ki2122 and will make thine house like the house of jeroboam the son of nebat and like the house of baasha the son of ahijah for the provocation wherewith thou hast provoked me to anger and made israel to sin
1ki2123 and of jezebel also spake the lord saying the dogs shall eat jezebel by the wall of jezreel
1ki2124 him that dieth of ahab in the city the dogs shall eat and him that dieth in the field shall the fowls of the air eat
1ki2125 but there was none like unto ahab which did sell himself to work wickedness in the sight of the lord whom jezebel his wife stirred up
1ki2126 and he did very abominably in following idols according to all things as did the amorites whom the lord cast out before the children of israel
1ki2127 and it came to pass when ahab heard those words that he rent his clothes and put sackcloth upon his flesh and fasted and lay in sackcloth and went softly
1ki2128 and the word of the lord came to elijah the tishbite saying
1ki2129 seest thou how ahab humbleth himself before me because he humbleth himself before me i will not bring the evil in his days but in his son's days will i bring the evil upon his house
1ki221 and they continued three years without war between syria and israel
1ki222 and it came to pass in the third year that jehoshaphat the king of judah came down to the king of israel
1ki223 and the king of israel said unto his servants know ye that ramoth in gilead is ours and we be still and take it not out of the hand of the king of syria
1ki224 and he said unto jehoshaphat wilt thou go with me to battle to ramothgilead and jehoshaphat said to the king of israel i am as thou art my people as thy people my horses as thy horses
1ki225 and jehoshaphat said unto the king of israel enquire i pray thee at the word of the lord to day
1ki226 then the king of israel gathered the prophets together about four hundred men and said unto them shall i go against ramothgilead to battle or shall i forbear and they said go up for the lord shall deliver it into the hand of the king
1ki227 and jehoshaphat said is there not here a prophet of the lord besides that we might enquire of him
1ki228 and the king of israel said unto jehoshaphat there is yet one man micaiah the son of imlah by whom we may enquire of the lord but i hate him for he doth not prophesy good concerning me but evil and jehoshaphat said let not the king say so
1ki229 then the king of israel called an officer and said hasten hither micaiah the son of imlah
1ki2210 and the king of israel and jehoshaphat the king of judah sat each on his throne having put on their robes in a void place in the entrance of the gate of samaria and all the prophets prophesied before them
1ki2211 and zedekiah the son of chenaanah made him horns of iron and he said thus saith the lord with these shalt thou push the syrians until thou have consumed them
1ki2212 and all the prophets prophesied so saying go up to ramothgilead and prosper for the lord shall deliver it into the king's hand
1ki2213 and the messenger that was gone to call micaiah spake unto him saying behold now the words of the prophets declare good unto the king with one mouth let thy word i pray thee be like the word of one of them and speak that which is good
1ki2214 and micaiah said as the lord liveth what the lord saith unto me that will i speak
1ki2215 so he came to the king and the king said unto him micaiah shall we go against ramothgilead to battle or shall we forbear and he answered him go and prosper for the lord shall deliver it into the hand of the king
1ki2216 and the king said unto him how many times shall i adjure thee that thou tell me nothing but that which is true in the name of the lord
1ki2217 and he said i saw all israel scattered upon the hills as sheep that have not a shepherd and the lord said these have no master let them return every man to his house in peace
1ki2218 and the king of israel said unto jehoshaphat did i not tell thee that he would prophesy no good concerning me but evil
1ki2219 and he said hear thou therefore the word of the lord i saw the lord sitting on his throne and all the host of heaven standing by him on his right hand and on his left
1ki2220 and the lord said who shall persuade ahab that he may go up and fall at ramothgilead and one said on this manner and another said on that manner
1ki2221 and there came forth a spirit and stood before the lord and said i will persuade him
1ki2222 and the lord said unto him wherewith and he said i will go forth and i will be a lying spirit in the mouth of all his prophets and he said thou shalt persuade him and prevail also go forth and do so
1ki2223 now therefore behold the lord hath put a lying spirit in the mouth of all these thy prophets and the lord hath spoken evil concerning thee
1ki2224 but zedekiah the son of chenaanah went near and smote micaiah on the cheek and said which way went the spirit of the lord from me to speak unto thee
1ki2225 and micaiah said behold thou shalt see in that day when thou shalt go into an inner chamber to hide thyself
1ki2226 and the king of israel said take micaiah and carry him back unto amon the governor of the city and to joash the king's son
1ki2227 and say thus saith the king put this fellow in the prison and feed him with bread of affliction and with water of affliction until i come in peace
1ki2228 and micaiah said if thou return at all in peace the lord hath not spoken by me and he said hearken o people every one of you
1ki2229 so the king of israel and jehoshaphat the king of judah went up to ramothgilead
1ki2230 and the king of israel said unto jehoshaphat i will disguise myself and enter into the battle but put thou on thy robes and the king of israel disguised himself and went into the battle
1ki2231 but the king of syria commanded his thirty and two captains that had rule over his chariots saying fight neither with small nor great save only with the king of israel
1ki2232 and it came to pass when the captains of the chariots saw jehoshaphat that they said surely it is the king of israel and they turned aside to fight against him and jehoshaphat cried out
1ki2233 and it came to pass when the captains of the chariots perceived that it was not the king of israel that they turned back from pursuing him
1ki2234 and a certain man drew a bow at a venture and smote the king of israel between the joints of the harness wherefore he said unto the driver of his chariot turn thine hand and carry me out of the host for i am wounded
1ki2235 and the battle increased that day and the king was stayed up in his chariot against the syrians and died at even and the blood ran out of the wound into the midst of the chariot
1ki2236 and there went a proclamation throughout the host about the going down of the sun saying every man to his city and every man to his own country
1ki2237 so the king died and was brought to samaria and they buried the king in samaria
1ki2238 and one washed the chariot in the pool of samaria and the dogs licked up his blood and they washed his armour according unto the word of the lord which he spake
1ki2239 now the rest of the acts of ahab and all that he did and the ivory house which he made and all the cities that he built are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of israel
1ki2240 so ahab slept with his fathers and ahaziah his son reigned in his stead
1ki2241 and jehoshaphat the son of asa began to reign over judah in the fourth year of ahab king of israel
1ki2242 jehoshaphat was thirty and five years old when he began to reign and he reigned twenty and five years in jerusalem and his mother's name was azubah the daughter of shilhi
1ki2243 and he walked in all the ways of asa his father he turned not aside from it doing that which was right in the eyes of the lord nevertheless the high places were not taken away for the people offered and burnt incense yet in the high places
1ki2244 and jehoshaphat made peace with the king of israel
1ki2245 now the rest of the acts of jehoshaphat and his might that he shewed and how he warred are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of judah
1ki2246 and the remnant of the sodomites which remained in the days of his father asa he took out of the land
1ki2247 there was then no king in edom a deputy was king
1ki2248 jehoshaphat made ships of tharshish to go to ophir for gold but they went not for the ships were broken at eziongeber
1ki2249 then said ahaziah the son of ahab unto jehoshaphat let my servants go with thy servants in the ships but jehoshaphat would not
1ki2250 and jehoshaphat slept with his fathers and was buried with his fathers in the city of david his father and jehoram his son reigned in his stead
1ki2251 ahaziah the son of ahab began to reign over israel in samaria the seventeenth year of jehoshaphat king of judah and reigned two years over israel
1ki2252 and he did evil in the sight of the lord and walked in the way of his father and in the way of his mother and in the way of jeroboam the son of nebat who made israel to sin
1ki2253 for he served baal and worshipped him and provoked to anger the lord god of israel according to all that his father had done
2ki11 then moab rebelled against israel after the death of ahab
2ki12 and ahaziah fell down through a lattice in his upper chamber that was in samaria and was sick and he sent messengers and said unto them go enquire of baalzebub the god of ekron whether i shall recover of this disease
2ki13 but the angel of the lord said to elijah the tishbite arise go up to meet the messengers of the king of samaria and say unto them is it not because there is not a god in israel that ye go to enquire of baalzebub the god of ekron
2ki14 now therefore thus saith the lord thou shalt not come down from that bed on which thou art gone up but shalt surely die and elijah departed
2ki15 and when the messengers turned back unto him he said unto them why are ye now turned back
2ki16 and they said unto him there came a man up to meet us and said unto us go turn again unto the king that sent you and say unto him thus saith the lord is it not because there is not a god in israel that thou sendest to enquire of baalzebub the god of ekron therefore thou shalt not come down from that bed on which thou art gone up but shalt surely die
2ki17 and he said unto them what manner of man was he which came up to meet you and told you these words
2ki18 and they answered him he was an hairy man and girt with a girdle of leather about his loins and he said it is elijah the tishbite
2ki19 then the king sent unto him a captain of fifty with his fifty and he went up to him and behold he sat on the top of an hill and he spake unto him thou man of god the king hath said come down
2ki110 and elijah answered and said to the captain of fifty if i be a man of god then let fire come down from heaven and consume thee and thy fifty and there came down fire from heaven and consumed him and his fifty
2ki111 again also he sent unto him another captain of fifty with his fifty and he answered and said unto him o man of god thus hath the king said come down quickly
2ki112 and elijah answered and said unto them if i be a man of god let fire come down from heaven and consume thee and thy fifty and the fire of god came down from heaven and consumed him and his fifty
2ki113 and he sent again a captain of the third fifty with his fifty and the third captain of fifty went up and came and fell on his knees before elijah and besought him and said unto him o man of god i pray thee let my life and the life of these fifty thy servants be precious in thy sight
2ki114 behold there came fire down from heaven and burnt up the two captains of the former fifties with their fifties therefore let my life now be precious in thy sight
2ki115 and the angel of the lord said unto elijah go down with him be not afraid of him and he arose and went down with him unto the king
2ki116 and he said unto him thus saith the lord forasmuch as thou hast sent messengers to enquire of baalzebub the god of ekron is it not because there is no god in israel to enquire of his word therefore thou shalt not come down off that bed on which thou art gone up but shalt surely die
2ki117 so he died according to the word of the lord which elijah had spoken and jehoram reigned in his stead in the second year of jehoram the son of jehoshaphat king of judah because he had no son
2ki118 now the rest of the acts of ahaziah which he did are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of israel
2ki21 and it came to pass when the lord would take up elijah into heaven by a whirlwind that elijah went with elisha from gilgal
2ki22 and elijah said unto elisha tarry here i pray thee for the lord hath sent me to bethel and elisha said unto him as the lord liveth and as thy soul liveth i will not leave thee so they went down to bethel
2ki23 and the sons of the prophets that were at bethel came forth to elisha and said unto him knowest thou that the lord will take away thy master from thy head to day and he said yea i know it hold ye your peace
2ki24 and elijah said unto him elisha tarry here i pray thee for the lord hath sent me to jericho and he said as the lord liveth and as thy soul liveth i will not leave thee so they came to jericho
2ki25 and the sons of the prophets that were at jericho came to elisha and said unto him knowest thou that the lord will take away thy master from thy head to day and he answered yea i know it hold ye your peace
2ki26 and elijah said unto him tarry i pray thee here for the lord hath sent me to jordan and he said as the lord liveth and as thy soul liveth i will not leave thee and they two went on
2ki27 and fifty men of the sons of the prophets went and stood to view afar off and they two stood by jordan
2ki28 and elijah took his mantle and wrapped it together and smote the waters and they were divided hither and thither so that they two went over on dry ground
2ki29 and it came to pass when they were gone over that elijah said unto elisha ask what i shall do for thee before i be taken away from thee and elisha said i pray thee let a double portion of thy spirit be upon me
2ki210 and he said thou hast asked a hard thing nevertheless if thou see me when i am taken from thee it shall be so unto thee but if not it shall not be so
2ki211 and it came to pass as they still went on and talked that behold there appeared a chariot of fire and horses of fire and parted them both asunder and elijah went up by a whirlwind into heaven
2ki212 and elisha saw it and he cried my father my father the chariot of israel and the horsemen thereof and he saw him no more and he took hold of his own clothes and rent them in two pieces
2ki213 he took up also the mantle of elijah that fell from him and went back and stood by the bank of jordan
2ki214 and he took the mantle of elijah that fell from him and smote the waters and said where is the lord god of elijah and when he also had smitten the waters they parted hither and thither and elisha went over
2ki215 and when the sons of the prophets which were to view at jericho saw him they said the spirit of elijah doth rest on elisha and they came to meet him and bowed themselves to the ground before him
2ki216 and they said unto him behold now there be with thy servants fifty strong men let them go we pray thee and seek thy master lest peradventure the spirit of the lord hath taken him up and cast him upon some mountain or into some valley and he said ye shall not send
2ki217 and when they urged him till he was ashamed he said send they sent therefore fifty men and they sought three days but found him not
2ki218 and when they came again to him for he tarried at jericho he said unto them did i not say unto you go not
2ki219 and the men of the city said unto elisha behold i pray thee the situation of this city is pleasant as my lord seeth but the water is naught and the ground barren
2ki220 and he said bring me a new cruse and put salt therein and they brought it to him
2ki221 and he went forth unto the spring of the waters and cast the salt in there and said thus saith the lord i have healed these waters there shall not be from thence any more death or barren land
2ki222 so the waters were healed unto this day according to the saying of elisha which he spake
2ki223 and he went up from thence unto bethel and as he was going up by the way there came forth little children out of the city and mocked him and said unto him go up thou bald head go up thou bald head
2ki224 and he turned back and looked on them and cursed them in the name of the lord and there came forth two she bears out of the wood and tare forty and two children of them
2ki225 and he went from thence to mount carmel and from thence he returned to samaria
2ki31 now jehoram the son of ahab began to reign over israel in samaria the eighteenth year of jehoshaphat king of judah and reigned twelve years
2ki32 and he wrought evil in the sight of the lord but not like his father and like his mother for he put away the image of baal that his father had made
2ki33 nevertheless he cleaved unto the sins of jeroboam the son of nebat which made israel to sin he departed not therefrom
2ki34 and mesha king of moab was a sheepmaster and rendered unto the king of israel an hundred thousand lambs and an hundred thousand rams with the wool
2ki35 but it came to pass when ahab was dead that the king of moab rebelled against the king of israel
2ki36 and king jehoram went out of samaria the same time and numbered all israel
2ki37 and he went and sent to jehoshaphat the king of judah saying the king of moab hath rebelled against me wilt thou go with me against moab to battle and he said i will go up i am as thou art my people as thy people and my horses as thy horses
2ki38 and he said which way shall we go up and he answered the way through the wilderness of edom
2ki39 so the king of israel went and the king of judah and the king of edom and they fetched a compass of seven days journey and there was no water for the host and for the cattle that followed them
2ki310 and the king of israel said alas that the lord hath called these three kings together to deliver them into the hand of moab
2ki311 but jehoshaphat said is there not here a prophet of the lord that we may enquire of the lord by him and one of the king of israel's servants answered and said here is elisha the son of shaphat which poured water on the hands of elijah
2ki312 and jehoshaphat said the word of the lord is with him so the king of israel and jehoshaphat and the king of edom went down to him
2ki313 and elisha said unto the king of israel what have i to do with thee get thee to the prophets of thy father and to the prophets of thy mother and the king of israel said unto him nay for the lord hath called these three kings together to deliver them into the hand of moab
2ki314 and elisha said as the lord of hosts liveth before whom i stand surely were it not that i regard the presence of jehoshaphat the king of judah i would not look toward thee nor see thee
2ki315 but now bring me a minstrel and it came to pass when the minstrel played that the hand of the lord came upon him
2ki316 and he said thus saith the lord make this valley full of ditches
2ki317 for thus saith the lord ye shall not see wind neither shall ye see rain yet that valley shall be filled with water that ye may drink both ye and your cattle and your beasts
2ki318 and this is but a light thing in the sight of the lord he will deliver the moabites also into your hand
2ki319 and ye shall smite every fenced city and every choice city and shall fell every good tree and stop all wells of water and mar every good piece of land with stones
2ki320 and it came to pass in the morning when the meat offering was offered that behold there came water by the way of edom and the country was filled with water
2ki321 and when all the moabites heard that the kings were come up to fight against them they gathered all that were able to put on armour and upward and stood in the border
