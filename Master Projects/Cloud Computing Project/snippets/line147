but made himself of no reputation and took upon him the form of a servant and was made in the likeness of men
and being found in fashion as a man he humbled himself and became obedient unto death even the death of the cross
wherefore god also hath highly exalted him and given him a name which is above every name
that at the name of jesus every knee should bow of things in heaven and things in earth and things under the earth
and that every tongue should confess that jesus christ is lord to the glory of god the father
wherefore my beloved as ye have always obeyed not as in my presence only but now much more in my absence work out your own salvation with fear and trembling
for it is god which worketh in you both to will and to do of his good pleasure
do all things without murmurings and disputings
that ye may be blameless and harmless the sons of god without rebuke in the midst of a crooked and perverse nation among whom ye shine as lights in the world
holding forth the word of life that i may rejoice in the day of christ that i have not run in vain neither laboured in vain
yea and if i be offered upon the sacrifice and service of your faith i joy and rejoice with you all
for the same cause also do ye joy and rejoice with me
but i trust in the lord jesus to send timotheus shortly unto you that i also may be of good comfort when i know your state
for i have no man likeminded who will naturally care for your state
for all seek their own not the things which are jesus christ's
but ye know the proof of him that as a son with the father he hath served with me in the gospel
him therefore i hope to send presently so soon as i shall see how it will go with me
but i trust in the lord that i also myself shall come shortly
yet i supposed it necessary to send to you epaphroditus my brother and companion in labour and fellowsoldier but your messenger and he that ministered to my wants
for he longed after you all and was full of heaviness because that ye had heard that he had been sick
for indeed he was sick nigh unto death but god had mercy on him and not on him only but on me also lest i should have sorrow upon sorrow
i sent him therefore the more carefully that when ye see him again ye may rejoice and that i may be the less sorrowful
receive him therefore in the lord with all gladness and hold such in reputation
because for the work of christ he was nigh unto death not regarding his life to supply your lack of service toward me
finally my brethren rejoice in the lord to write the same things to you to me indeed is not grievous but for you it is safe
beware of dogs beware of evil workers beware of the concision
for we are the circumcision which worship god in the spirit and rejoice in christ jesus and have no confidence in the flesh
though i might also have confidence in the flesh if any other man thinketh that he hath whereof he might trust in the flesh i more
circumcised the eighth day of the stock of israel of the tribe of benjamin an hebrew of the hebrews as touching the law a pharisee
concerning zeal persecuting the church touching the righteousness which is in the law blameless
but what things were gain to me those i counted loss for christ
yea doubtless and i count all things but loss for the excellency of the knowledge of christ jesus my lord for whom i have suffered the loss of all things and do count them but dung that i may win christ
and be found in him not having mine own righteousness which is of the law but that which is through the faith of christ the righteousness which is of god by faith
that i may know him and the power of his resurrection and the fellowship of his sufferings being made conformable unto his death
if by any means i might attain unto the resurrection of the dead
not as though i had already attained either were already perfect but i follow after if that i may apprehend that for which also i am apprehended of christ jesus
brethren i count not myself to have apprehended but this one thing i do forgetting those things which are behind and reaching forth unto those things which are before
i press toward the mark for the prize of the high calling of god in christ jesus
let us therefore as many as be perfect be thus minded and if in any thing ye be otherwise minded god shall reveal even this unto you
nevertheless whereto we have already attained let us walk by the same rule let us mind the same thing
brethren be followers together of me and mark them which walk so as ye have us for an ensample
for many walk of whom i have told you often and now tell you even weeping that they are the enemies of the cross of christ
whose end is destruction whose god is their belly and whose glory is in their shame who mind earthly things
for our conversation is in heaven from whence also we look for the saviour the lord jesus christ
who shall change our vile body that it may be fashioned like unto his glorious body according to the working whereby he is able even to subdue all things unto himself
therefore my brethren dearly beloved and longed for my joy and crown so stand fast in the lord my dearly beloved
i beseech euodias and beseech syntyche that they be of the same mind in the lord
and i intreat thee also true yokefellow help those women which laboured with me in the gospel with clement also and with other my fellowlabourers whose names are in the book of life
rejoice in the lord alway and again i say rejoice
let your moderation be known unto all men the lord is at hand
be careful for nothing but in every thing by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving let your requests be made known unto god
and the peace of god which passeth all understanding shall keep your hearts and minds through christ jesus
finally brethren whatsoever things are true whatsoever things are honest whatsoever things are just whatsoever things are pure whatsoever things are lovely whatsoever things are of good report if there be any virtue and if there be any praise think on these things
those things which ye have both learned and received and heard and seen in me do and the god of peace shall be with you
but i rejoiced in the lord greatly that now at the last your care of me hath flourished again wherein ye were also careful but ye lacked opportunity
not that i speak in respect of want for i have learned in whatsoever state i am therewith to be content
i know both how to be abased and i know how to abound every where and in all things i am instructed both to be full and to be hungry both to abound and to suffer need
i can do all things through christ which strengtheneth me
notwithstanding ye have well done that ye did communicate with my affliction
now ye philippians know also that in the beginning of the gospel when i departed from macedonia no church communicated with me as concerning giving and receiving but ye only
for even in thessalonica ye sent once and again unto my necessity
not because i desire a gift but i desire fruit that may abound to your account
but i have all and abound i am full having received of epaphroditus the things which were sent from you an odour of a sweet smell a sacrifice acceptable wellpleasing to god
but my god shall supply all your need according to his riches in glory by christ jesus
now unto god and our father be glory for ever and ever amen
salute every saint in christ jesus the brethren which are with me greet you
all the saints salute you chiefly they that are of caesar's household
the grace of our lord jesus christ be with you all amen
paul an apostle of jesus christ by the will of god and timotheus our brother
to the saints and faithful brethren in christ which are at colosse grace be unto you and peace from god our father and the lord jesus christ
we give thanks to god and the father of our lord jesus christ praying always for you
since we heard of your faith in christ jesus and of the love which ye have to all the saints
for the hope which is laid up for you in heaven whereof ye heard before in the word of the truth of the gospel
which is come unto you as it is in all the world and bringeth forth fruit as it doth also in you since the day ye heard of it and knew the grace of god in truth
as ye also learned of epaphras our dear fellowservant who is for you a faithful minister of christ
who also declared unto us your love in the spirit
for this cause we also since the day we heard it do not cease to pray for you and to desire that ye might be filled with the knowledge of his will in all wisdom and spiritual understanding
that ye might walk worthy of the lord unto all pleasing being fruitful in every good work and increasing in the knowledge of god
strengthened with all might according to his glorious power unto all patience and longsuffering with joyfulness
giving thanks unto the father which hath made us meet to be partakers of the inheritance of the saints in light
who hath delivered us from the power of darkness and hath translated us into the kingdom of his dear son
in whom we have redemption through his blood even the forgiveness of sins
who is the image of the invisible god the firstborn of every creature
for by him were all things created that are in heaven and that are in earth visible and invisible whether they be thrones or dominions or principalities or powers all things were created by him and for him
and he is before all things and by him all things consist
and he is the head of the body the church who is the beginning the firstborn from the dead that in all things he might have the preeminence
for it pleased the father that in him should all fulness dwell
and having made peace through the blood of his cross by him to reconcile all things unto himself by him i say whether they be things in earth or things in heaven
and you that were sometime alienated and enemies in your mind by wicked works yet now hath he reconciled
in the body of his flesh through death to present you holy and unblameable and unreproveable in his sight
if ye continue in the faith grounded and settled and be not moved away from the hope of the gospel which ye have heard and which was preached to every creature which is under heaven whereof i paul am made a minister
who now rejoice in my sufferings for you and fill up that which is behind of the afflictions of christ in my flesh for his body's sake which is the church
whereof i am made a minister according to the dispensation of god which is given to me for you to fulfil the word of god
even the mystery which hath been hid from ages and from generations but now is made manifest to his saints
to whom god would make known what is the riches of the glory of this mystery among the gentiles which is christ in you the hope of glory
whom we preach warning every man and teaching every man in all wisdom that we may present every man perfect in christ jesus
whereunto i also labour striving according to his working which worketh in me mightily
for i would that ye knew what great conflict i have for you and for them at laodicea and for as many as have not seen my face in the flesh
that their hearts might be comforted being knit together in love and unto all riches of the full assurance of understanding to the acknowledgement of the mystery of god and of the father and of christ
in whom are hid all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge
and this i say lest any man should beguile you with enticing words
for though i be absent in the flesh yet am i with you in the spirit joying and beholding your order and the stedfastness of your faith in christ
as ye have therefore received christ jesus the lord so walk ye in him
rooted and built up in him and stablished in the faith as ye have been taught abounding therein with thanksgiving
beware lest any man spoil you through philosophy and vain deceit after the tradition of men after the rudiments of the world and not after christ
for in him dwelleth all the fulness of the godhead bodily
and ye are complete in him which is the head of all principality and power
in whom also ye are circumcised with the circumcision made without hands in putting off the body of the sins of the flesh by the circumcision of christ
buried with him in baptism wherein also ye are risen with him through the faith of the operation of god who hath raised him from the dead
and you being dead in your sins and the uncircumcision of your flesh hath he quickened together with him having forgiven you all trespasses
blotting out the handwriting of ordinances that was against us which was contrary to us and took it out of the way nailing it to his cross
and having spoiled principalities and powers he made a shew of them openly triumphing over them in it
let no man therefore judge you in meat or in drink or in respect of an holyday or of the new moon or of the sabbath days
which are a shadow of things to come but the body is of christ
let no man beguile you of your reward in a voluntary humility and worshipping of angels intruding into those things which he hath not seen vainly puffed up by his fleshly mind
and not holding the head from which all the body by joints and bands having nourishment ministered and knit together increaseth with the increase of god
wherefore if ye be dead with christ from the rudiments of the world why as though living in the world are ye subject to ordinances
touch not taste not handle not
which all are to perish with the using after the commandments and doctrines of men
which things have indeed a shew of wisdom in will worship and humility and neglecting of the body not in any honour to the satisfying of the flesh
if ye then be risen with christ seek those things which are above where christ sitteth on the right hand of god
set your affection on things above not on things on the earth
for ye are dead and your life is hid with christ in god
when christ who is our life shall appear then shall ye also appear with him in glory
mortify therefore your members which are upon the earth fornication uncleanness inordinate affection evil concupiscence and covetousness which is idolatry
for which things sake the wrath of god cometh on the children of disobedience
in the which ye also walked some time when ye lived in them
but now ye also put off all these anger wrath malice blasphemy filthy communication out of your mouth
lie not one to another seeing that ye have put off the old man with his deeds
and have put on the new man which is renewed in knowledge after the image of him that created him
where there is neither greek nor jew circumcision nor uncircumcision barbarian scythian bond nor free but christ is all and in all
put on therefore as the elect of god holy and beloved bowels of mercies kindness humbleness of mind meekness longsuffering
forbearing one another and forgiving one another if any man have a quarrel against any even as christ forgave you so also do ye
and above all these things put on charity which is the bond of perfectness
and let the peace of god rule in your hearts to the which also ye are called in one body and be ye thankful
let the word of christ dwell in you richly in all wisdom teaching and admonishing one another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs singing with grace in your hearts to the lord
and whatsoever ye do in word or deed do all in the name of the lord jesus giving thanks to god and the father by him
wives submit yourselves unto your own husbands as it is fit in the lord
husbands love your wives and be not bitter against them
children obey your parents in all things for this is well pleasing unto the lord
fathers provoke not your children to anger lest they be discouraged
servants obey in all things your masters according to the flesh not with eyeservice as menpleasers but in singleness of heart fearing god
and whatsoever ye do do it heartily as to the lord and not unto men
knowing that of the lord ye shall receive the reward of the inheritance for ye serve the lord christ
but he that doeth wrong shall receive for the wrong which he hath done and there is no respect of persons
masters give unto your servants that which is just and equal knowing that ye also have a master in heaven
continue in prayer and watch in the same with thanksgiving
withal praying also for us that god would open unto us a door of utterance to speak the mystery of christ for which i am also in bonds
that i may make it manifest as i ought to speak
walk in wisdom toward them that are without redeeming the time
let your speech be alway with grace seasoned with salt that ye may know how ye ought to answer every man
all my state shall tychicus declare unto you who is a beloved brother and a faithful minister and fellowservant in the lord
whom i have sent unto you for the same purpose that he might know your estate and comfort your hearts
with onesimus a faithful and beloved brother who is one of you they shall make known unto you all things which are done here
aristarchus my fellowprisoner saluteth you and marcus sister's son to barnabas touching whom ye received commandments if he come unto you receive him
and jesus which is called justus who are of the circumcision these only are my fellowworkers unto the kingdom of god which have been a comfort unto me
epaphras who is one of you a servant of christ saluteth you always labouring fervently for you in prayers that ye may stand perfect and complete in all the will of god
for i bear him record that he hath a great zeal for you and them that are in laodicea and them in hierapolis
luke the beloved physician and demas greet you
salute the brethren which are in laodicea and nymphas and the church which is in his house
and when this epistle is read among you cause that it be read also in the church of the laodiceans and that ye likewise read the epistle from laodicea
and say to archippus take heed to the ministry which thou hast received in the lord that thou fulfil it
the salutation by the hand of me paul remember my bonds grace be with you amen
1th11 paul and silvanus and timotheus unto the church of the thessalonians which is in god the father and in the lord jesus christ grace be unto you and peace from god our father and the lord jesus christ
1th12 we give thanks to god always for you all making mention of you in our prayers
1th13 remembering without ceasing your work of faith and labour of love and patience of hope in our lord jesus christ in the sight of god and our father
1th14 knowing brethren beloved your election of god
1th15 for our gospel came not unto you in word only but also in power and in the holy ghost and in much assurance as ye know what manner of men we were among you for your sake
1th16 and ye became followers of us and of the lord having received the word in much affliction with joy of the holy ghost
1th17 so that ye were ensamples to all that believe in macedonia and achaia
1th18 for from you sounded out the word of the lord not only in macedonia and achaia but also in every place your faith to godward is spread abroad so that we need not to speak any thing
1th19 for they themselves shew of us what manner of entering in we had unto you and how ye turned to god from idols to serve the living and true god
1th110 and to wait for his son from heaven whom he raised from the dead even jesus which delivered us from the wrath to come
1th21 for yourselves brethren know our entrance in unto you that it was not in vain
1th22 but even after that we had suffered before and were shamefully entreated as ye know at philippi we were bold in our god to speak unto you the gospel of god with much contention
1th23 for our exhortation was not of deceit nor of uncleanness nor in guile
1th24 but as we were allowed of god to be put in trust with the gospel even so we speak not as pleasing men but god which trieth our hearts
1th25 for neither at any time used we flattering words as ye know nor a cloke of covetousness god is witness
1th26 nor of men sought we glory neither of you nor yet of others when we might have been burdensome as the apostles of christ
1th27 but we were gentle among you even as a nurse cherisheth her children
1th28 so being affectionately desirous of you we were willing to have imparted unto you not the gospel of god only but also our own souls because ye were dear unto us
1th29 for ye remember brethren our labour and travail for labouring night and day because we would not be chargeable unto any of you we preached unto you the gospel of god
1th210 ye are witnesses and god also how holily and justly and unblameably we behaved ourselves among you that believe
1th211 as ye know how we exhorted and comforted and charged every one of you as a father doth his children
1th212 that ye would walk worthy of god who hath called you unto his kingdom and glory
1th213 for this cause also thank we god without ceasing because when ye received the word of god which ye heard of us ye received it not as the word of men but as it is in truth the word of god which effectually worketh also in you that believe
1th214 for ye brethren became followers of the churches of god which in judaea are in christ jesus for ye also have suffered like things of your own countrymen even as they have of the jews
1th215 who both killed the lord jesus and their own prophets and have persecuted us and they please not god and are contrary to all men
1th216 forbidding us to speak to the gentiles that they might be saved to fill up their sins alway for the wrath is come upon them to the uttermost
1th217 but we brethren being taken from you for a short time in presence not in heart endeavoured the more abundantly to see your face with great desire
1th218 wherefore we would have come unto you even i paul once and again but satan hindered us
1th219 for what is our hope or joy or crown of rejoicing are not even ye in the presence of our lord jesus christ at his coming
1th220 for ye are our glory and joy
1th31 wherefore when we could no longer forbear we thought it good to be left at athens alone
1th32 and sent timotheus our brother and minister of god and our fellowlabourer in the gospel of christ to establish you and to comfort you concerning your faith
1th33 that no man should be moved by these afflictions for yourselves know that we are appointed thereunto
1th34 for verily when we were with you we told you before that we should suffer tribulation even as it came to pass and ye know
1th35 for this cause when i could no longer forbear i sent to know your faith lest by some means the tempter have tempted you and our labour be in vain
1th36 but now when timotheus came from you unto us and brought us good tidings of your faith and charity and that ye have good remembrance of us always desiring greatly to see us as we also to see you
1th37 therefore brethren we were comforted over you in all our affliction and distress by your faith
