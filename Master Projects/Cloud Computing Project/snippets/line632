talbot well let them practise and converse with spirits
 god is our fortress in whose conquering name
 let us resolve to scale their flinty bulwarks
bedford ascend brave talbot we will follow thee
talbot not all together better far i guess
 that we do make our entrance several ways
 that if it chance the one of us do fail
 the other yet may rise against their force
bedford agreed i'll to yond corner
burgundy and i to this
talbot and here will talbot mount or make his grave
 now salisbury for thee and for the right
 of english henry shall this night appear
 how much in duty i am bound to both
sentinels arm arm the enemy doth make assault
 cry st george a talbot'
 the french leap over the walls in their shirts
 enter several ways the bastard of orleans
 alencon and reignier half ready and half unready
alencon how now my lords what all unready so
bastard of orleans unready ay and glad we scaped so well
reignier twas time i trow to wake and leave our beds
 hearing alarums at our chamberdoors
alencon of all exploits since first i follow'd arms
 ne'er heard i of a warlike enterprise
 more venturous or desperate than this
bastard of orleans i think this talbot be a fiend of hell
reignier if not of hell the heavens sure favour him
alencon here cometh charles i marvel how he sped
bastard of orleans tut holy joan was his defensive guard
 enter charles and joan la pucelle
charles is this thy cunning thou deceitful dame
 didst thou at first to flatter us withal
 make us partakers of a little gain
 that now our loss might be ten times so much
joan la pucelle wherefore is charles impatient with his friend
 at all times will you have my power alike
 sleeping or waking must i still prevail
 or will you blame and lay the fault on me
 improvident soldiers had your watch been good
 this sudden mischief never could have fall'n
charles duke of alencon this was your default
 that being captain of the watch tonight
 did look no better to that weighty charge
alencon had all your quarters been as safely kept
 as that whereof i had the government
 we had not been thus shamefully surprised
bastard of orleans mine was secure
reignier and so was mine my lord
charles and for myself most part of all this night
 within her quarter and mine own precinct
 i was employ'd in passing to and fro
 about relieving of the sentinels
 then how or which way should they first break in
joan la pucelle question my lords no further of the case
 how or which way tis sure they found some place
 but weakly guarded where the breach was made
 and now there rests no other shift but this
 to gather our soldiers scatter'd and dispersed
 and lay new platforms to endamage them
 alarum enter an english soldier crying a
 talbot a talbot they fly leaving their
 clothes behind
soldier i'll be so bold to take what they have left
 the cry of talbot serves me for a sword
 for i have loaden me with many spoils
 using no other weapon but his name

act ii
scene ii orleans within the town
 enter talbot bedford burgundy a captain and others
bedford the day begins to break and night is fled
 whose pitchy mantle overveil'd the earth
 here sound retreat and cease our hot pursuit
 retreat sounded
talbot bring forth the body of old salisbury
 and here advance it in the marketplace
 the middle centre of this cursed town
 now have i paid my vow unto his soul
 for every drop of blood was drawn from him
 there hath at least five frenchmen died tonight
 and that hereafter ages may behold
 what ruin happen'd in revenge of him
 within their chiefest temple i'll erect
 a tomb wherein his corpse shall be interr'd
 upon the which that every one may read
 shall be engraved the sack of orleans
 the treacherous manner of his mournful death
 and what a terror he had been to france
 but lords in all our bloody massacre
 i muse we met not with the dauphin's grace
 his newcome champion virtuous joan of arc
 nor any of his false confederates
bedford tis thought lord talbot when the fight began
 roused on the sudden from their drowsy beds
 they did amongst the troops of armed men
 leap o'er the walls for refuge in the field
burgundy myself as far as i could well discern
 for smoke and dusky vapours of the night
 am sure i scared the dauphin and his trull
 when arm in arm they both came swiftly running
 like to a pair of loving turtledoves
 that could not live asunder day or night
 after that things are set in order here
 we'll follow them with all the power we have
 enter a messenger
messenger all hail my lords which of this princely train
 call ye the warlike talbot for his acts
 so much applauded through the realm of france
talbot here is the talbot who would speak with him
messenger the virtuous lady countess of auvergne
 with modesty admiring thy renown
 by me entreats great lord thou wouldst vouchsafe
 to visit her poor castle where she lies
 that she may boast she hath beheld the man
 whose glory fills the world with loud report
burgundy is it even so nay then i see our wars
 will turn unto a peaceful comic sport
 when ladies crave to be encounter'd with
 you may not my lord despise her gentle suit
talbot ne'er trust me then for when a world of men
 could not prevail with all their oratory
 yet hath a woman's kindness overruled
 and therefore tell her i return great thanks
 and in submission will attend on her
 will not your honours bear me company
bedford no truly it is more than manners will
 and i have heard it said unbidden guests
 are often welcomest when they are gone
talbot well then alone since there's no remedy
 i mean to prove this lady's courtesy
 come hither captain
 whispers
 you perceive my mind
captain i do my lord and mean accordingly

 enter the countess and her porter
countess
of auvergne porter remember what i gave in charge
 and when you have done so bring the keys to me
porter madam i will
 exit
countess
of auvergne the plot is laid if all things fall out right
 i shall as famous be by this exploit
 as scythian tomyris by cyrus death
 great is the rumor of this dreadful knight
 and his achievements of no less account
 fain would mine eyes be witness with mine ears
 to give their censure of these rare reports
 enter messenger and talbot
messenger madam
 according as your ladyship desired
 by message craved so is lord talbot come
countess
of auvergne and he is welcome what is this the man
messenger madam it is
countess
of auvergne is this the scourge of france
 is this the talbot so much fear'd abroad
 that with his name the mothers still their babes
 i see report is fabulous and false
 i thought i should have seen some hercules
 a second hector for his grim aspect
 and large proportion of his strongknit limbs
 alas this is a child a silly dwarf
 it cannot be this weak and writhled shrimp
 should strike such terror to his enemies
talbot madam i have been bold to trouble you
 but since your ladyship is not at leisure
 i'll sort some other time to visit you
countess
of auvergne what means he now go ask him whither he goes
messenger stay my lord talbot for my lady craves
 to know the cause of your abrupt departure
talbot marry for that she's in a wrong belief
 i go to certify her talbot's here
 reenter porter with keys
countess
of auvergne if thou be he then art thou prisoner
talbot prisoner to whom
countess
of auvergne to me bloodthirsty lord
 and for that cause i trained thee to my house
 long time thy shadow hath been thrall to me
 for in my gallery thy picture hangs
 but now the substance shall endure the like
 and i will chain these legs and arms of thine
 that hast by tyranny these many years
 wasted our country slain our citizens
 and sent our sons and husbands captivate
talbot ha ha ha
countess
of auvergne laughest thou wretch thy mirth shall turn to moan
talbot i laugh to see your ladyship so fond
 to think that you have aught but talbot's shadow
