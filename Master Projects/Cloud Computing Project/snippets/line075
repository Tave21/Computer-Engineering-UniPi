i will also praise thee with the psaltery even thy truth o my god unto thee will i sing with the harp o thou holy one of israel
my lips shall greatly rejoice when i sing unto thee and my soul which thou hast redeemed
my tongue also shall talk of thy righteousness all the day long for they are confounded for they are brought unto shame that seek my hurt
give the king thy judgments o god and thy righteousness unto the king's son
he shall judge thy people with righteousness and thy poor with judgment
the mountains shall bring peace to the people and the little hills by righteousness
he shall judge the poor of the people he shall save the children of the needy and shall break in pieces the oppressor
they shall fear thee as long as the sun and moon endure throughout all generations
he shall come down like rain upon the mown grass as showers that water the earth
in his days shall the righteous flourish and abundance of peace so long as the moon endureth
he shall have dominion also from sea to sea and from the river unto the ends of the earth
they that dwell in the wilderness shall bow before him and his enemies shall lick the dust
the kings of tarshish and of the isles shall bring presents the kings of sheba and seba shall offer gifts
yea all kings shall fall down before him all nations shall serve him
for he shall deliver the needy when he crieth the poor also and him that hath no helper
he shall spare the poor and needy and shall save the souls of the needy
he shall redeem their soul from deceit and violence and precious shall their blood be in his sight
and he shall live and to him shall be given of the gold of sheba prayer also shall be made for him continually and daily shall he be praised
there shall be an handful of corn in the earth upon the top of the mountains the fruit thereof shall shake like lebanon and they of the city shall flourish like grass of the earth
his name shall endure for ever his name shall be continued as long as the sun and men shall be blessed in him all nations shall call him blessed
blessed be the lord god the god of israel who only doeth wondrous things
and blessed be his glorious name for ever and let the whole earth be filled with his glory amen and amen
the prayers of david the son of jesse are ended
truly god is good to israel even to such as are of a clean heart
but as for me my feet were almost gone my steps had well nigh slipped
for i was envious at the foolish when i saw the prosperity of the wicked
for there are no bands in their death but their strength is firm
they are not in trouble as other men neither are they plagued like other men
therefore pride compasseth them about as a chain violence covereth them as a garment
their eyes stand out with fatness they have more than heart could wish
they are corrupt and speak wickedly concerning oppression they speak loftily
they set their mouth against the heavens and their tongue walketh through the earth
therefore his people return hither and waters of a full cup are wrung out to them
and they say how doth god know and is there knowledge in the most high
behold these are the ungodly who prosper in the world they increase in riches
verily i have cleansed my heart in vain and washed my hands in innocency
for all the day long have i been plagued and chastened every morning
if i say i will speak thus behold i should offend against the generation of thy children
when i thought to know this it was too painful for me
until i went into the sanctuary of god then understood i their end
surely thou didst set them in slippery places thou castedst them down into destruction
how are they brought into desolation as in a moment they are utterly consumed with terrors
as a dream when one awaketh so o lord when thou awakest thou shalt despise their image
thus my heart was grieved and i was pricked in my reins
so foolish was i and ignorant i was as a beast before thee
nevertheless i am continually with thee thou hast holden me by my right hand
thou shalt guide me with thy counsel and afterward receive me to glory
whom have i in heaven but thee and there is none upon earth that i desire beside thee
my flesh and my heart faileth but god is the strength of my heart and my portion for ever
for lo they that are far from thee shall perish thou hast destroyed all them that go a whoring from thee
but it is good for me to draw near to god i have put my trust in the lord god that i may declare all thy works
o god why hast thou cast us off for ever why doth thine anger smoke against the sheep of thy pasture
remember thy congregation which thou hast purchased of old the rod of thine inheritance which thou hast redeemed this mount zion wherein thou hast dwelt
lift up thy feet unto the perpetual desolations even all that the enemy hath done wickedly in the sanctuary
thine enemies roar in the midst of thy congregations they set up their ensigns for signs
a man was famous according as he had lifted up axes upon the thick trees
but now they break down the carved work thereof at once with axes and hammers
they have cast fire into thy sanctuary they have defiled by casting down the dwelling place of thy name to the ground
they said in their hearts let us destroy them together they have burned up all the synagogues of god in the land
we see not our signs there is no more any prophet neither is there among us any that knoweth how long
o god how long shall the adversary reproach shall the enemy blaspheme thy name for ever
why withdrawest thou thy hand even thy right hand pluck it out of thy bosom
for god is my king of old working salvation in the midst of the earth
thou didst divide the sea by thy strength thou brakest the heads of the dragons in the waters
thou brakest the heads of leviathan in pieces and gavest him to be meat to the people inhabiting the wilderness
thou didst cleave the fountain and the flood thou driedst up mighty rivers
the day is thine the night also is thine thou hast prepared the light and the sun
thou hast set all the borders of the earth thou hast made summer and winter
remember this that the enemy hath reproached o lord and that the foolish people have blasphemed thy name
o deliver not the soul of thy turtledove unto the multitude of the wicked forget not the congregation of thy poor for ever
have respect unto the covenant for the dark places of the earth are full of the habitations of cruelty
o let not the oppressed return ashamed let the poor and needy praise thy name
arise o god plead thine own cause remember how the foolish man reproacheth thee daily
forget not the voice of thine enemies the tumult of those that rise up against thee increaseth continually
unto thee o god do we give thanks unto thee do we give thanks for that thy name is near thy wondrous works declare
when i shall receive the congregation i will judge uprightly
the earth and all the inhabitants thereof are dissolved i bear up the pillars of it selah
i said unto the fools deal not foolishly and to the wicked lift not up the horn
lift not up your horn on high speak not with a stiff neck
for promotion cometh neither from the east nor from the west nor from the south
but god is the judge he putteth down one and setteth up another
for in the hand of the lord there is a cup and the wine is red it is full of mixture and he poureth out of the same but the dregs thereof all the wicked of the earth shall wring them out and drink them
but i will declare for ever i will sing praises to the god of jacob
all the horns of the wicked also will i cut off but the horns of the righteous shall be exalted
in judah is god known his name is great in israel
in salem also is his tabernacle and his dwelling place in zion
there brake he the arrows of the bow the shield and the sword and the battle selah
thou art more glorious and excellent than the mountains of prey
the stouthearted are spoiled they have slept their sleep and none of the men of might have found their hands
at thy rebuke o god of jacob both the chariot and horse are cast into a dead sleep
thou even thou art to be feared and who may stand in thy sight when once thou art angry
thou didst cause judgment to be heard from heaven the earth feared and was still
when god arose to judgment to save all the meek of the earth selah
surely the wrath of man shall praise thee the remainder of wrath shalt thou restrain
vow and pay unto the lord your god let all that be round about him bring presents unto him that ought to be feared
he shall cut off the spirit of princes he is terrible to the kings of the earth
i cried unto god with my voice even unto god with my voice and he gave ear unto me
in the day of my trouble i sought the lord my sore ran in the night and ceased not my soul refused to be comforted
i remembered god and was troubled i complained and my spirit was overwhelmed selah
thou holdest mine eyes waking i am so troubled that i cannot speak
i have considered the days of old the years of ancient times
i call to remembrance my song in the night i commune with mine own heart and my spirit made diligent search
will the lord cast off for ever and will he be favourable no more
is his mercy clean gone for ever doth his promise fail for evermore
hath god forgotten to be gracious hath he in anger shut up his tender mercies selah
and i said this is my infirmity but i will remember the years of the right hand of the most high
i will remember the works of the lord surely i will remember thy wonders of old
i will meditate also of all thy work and talk of thy doings
thy way o god is in the sanctuary who is so great a god as our god
thou art the god that doest wonders thou hast declared thy strength among the people
thou hast with thine arm redeemed thy people the sons of jacob and joseph selah
the waters saw thee o god the waters saw thee they were afraid the depths also were troubled
the clouds poured out water the skies sent out a sound thine arrows also went abroad
the voice of thy thunder was in the heaven the lightnings lightened the world the earth trembled and shook
thy way is in the sea and thy path in the great waters and thy footsteps are not known
thou leddest thy people like a flock by the hand of moses and aaron
give ear o my people to my law incline your ears to the words of my mouth
i will open my mouth in a parable i will utter dark sayings of old
which we have heard and known and our fathers have told us
we will not hide them from their children shewing to the generation to come the praises of the lord and his strength and his wonderful works that he hath done
for he established a testimony in jacob and appointed a law in israel which he commanded our fathers that they should make them known to their children
that the generation to come might know them even the children which should be born who should arise and declare them to their children
that they might set their hope in god and not forget the works of god but keep his commandments
and might not be as their fathers a stubborn and rebellious generation a generation that set not their heart aright and whose spirit was not stedfast with god
the children of ephraim being armed and carrying bows turned back in the day of battle
they kept not the covenant of god and refused to walk in his law
and forgat his works and his wonders that he had shewed them
marvellous things did he in the sight of their fathers in the land of egypt in the field of zoan
he divided the sea and caused them to pass through and he made the waters to stand as an heap
in the daytime also he led them with a cloud and all the night with a light of fire
he clave the rocks in the wilderness and gave them drink as out of the great depths
he brought streams also out of the rock and caused waters to run down like rivers
and they sinned yet more against him by provoking the most high in the wilderness
and they tempted god in their heart by asking meat for their lust
yea they spake against god they said can god furnish a table in the wilderness
behold he smote the rock that the waters gushed out and the streams overflowed can he give bread also can he provide flesh for his people
therefore the lord heard this and was wroth so a fire was kindled against jacob and anger also came up against israel
because they believed not in god and trusted not in his salvation
though he had commanded the clouds from above and opened the doors of heaven
and had rained down manna upon them to eat and had given them of the corn of heaven
man did eat angels food he sent them meat to the full
he caused an east wind to blow in the heaven and by his power he brought in the south wind
he rained flesh also upon them as dust and feathered fowls like as the sand of the sea
and he let it fall in the midst of their camp round about their habitations
so they did eat and were well filled for he gave them their own desire
they were not estranged from their lust but while their meat was yet in their mouths
the wrath of god came upon them and slew the fattest of them and smote down the chosen men of israel
for all this they sinned still and believed not for his wondrous works
therefore their days did he consume in vanity and their years in trouble
when he slew them then they sought him and they returned and enquired early after god
and they remembered that god was their rock and the high god their redeemer
nevertheless they did flatter him with their mouth and they lied unto him with their tongues
for their heart was not right with him neither were they stedfast in his covenant
but he being full of compassion forgave their iniquity and destroyed them not yea many a time turned he his anger away and did not stir up all his wrath
for he remembered that they were but flesh a wind that passeth away and cometh not again
how oft did they provoke him in the wilderness and grieve him in the desert
yea they turned back and tempted god and limited the holy one of israel
they remembered not his hand nor the day when he delivered them from the enemy
how he had wrought his signs in egypt and his wonders in the field of zoan
and had turned their rivers into blood and their floods that they could not drink
he sent divers sorts of flies among them which devoured them and frogs which destroyed them
he gave also their increase unto the caterpiller and their labour unto the locust
he destroyed their vines with hail and their sycomore trees with frost
he gave up their cattle also to the hail and their flocks to hot thunderbolts
he cast upon them the fierceness of his anger wrath and indignation and trouble by sending evil angels among them
he made a way to his anger he spared not their soul from death but gave their life over to the pestilence
and smote all the firstborn in egypt the chief of their strength in the tabernacles of ham
but made his own people to go forth like sheep and guided them in the wilderness like a flock
and he led them on safely so that they feared not but the sea overwhelmed their enemies
and he brought them to the border of his sanctuary even to this mountain which his right hand had purchased
he cast out the heathen also before them and divided them an inheritance by line and made the tribes of israel to dwell in their tents
yet they tempted and provoked the most high god and kept not his testimonies
but turned back and dealt unfaithfully like their fathers they were turned aside like a deceitful bow
for they provoked him to anger with their high places and moved him to jealousy with their graven images
when god heard this he was wroth and greatly abhorred israel
so that he forsook the tabernacle of shiloh the tent which he placed among men
and delivered his strength into captivity and his glory into the enemy's hand
he gave his people over also unto the sword and was wroth with his inheritance
the fire consumed their young men and their maidens were not given to marriage
their priests fell by the sword and their widows made no lamentation
then the lord awaked as one out of sleep and like a mighty man that shouteth by reason of wine
and he smote his enemies in the hinder parts he put them to a perpetual reproach
moreover he refused the tabernacle of joseph and chose not the tribe of ephraim
but chose the tribe of judah the mount zion which he loved
and he built his sanctuary like high palaces like the earth which he hath established for ever
he chose david also his servant and took him from the sheepfolds
from following the ewes great with young he brought him to feed jacob his people and israel his inheritance
so he fed them according to the integrity of his heart and guided them by the skilfulness of his hands
o god the heathen are come into thine inheritance thy holy temple have they defiled they have laid jerusalem on heaps
the dead bodies of thy servants have they given to be meat unto the fowls of the heaven the flesh of thy saints unto the beasts of the earth
their blood have they shed like water round about jerusalem and there was none to bury them
we are become a reproach to our neighbours a scorn and derision to them that are round about us
how long lord wilt thou be angry for ever shall thy jealousy burn like fire
pour out thy wrath upon the heathen that have not known thee and upon the kingdoms that have not called upon thy name
for they have devoured jacob and laid waste his dwelling place
o remember not against us former iniquities let thy tender mercies speedily prevent us for we are brought very low
help us o god of our salvation for the glory of thy name and deliver us and purge away our sins for thy name's sake
wherefore should the heathen say where is their god let him be known among the heathen in our sight by the revenging of the blood of thy servants which is shed
let the sighing of the prisoner come before thee according to the greatness of thy power preserve thou those that are appointed to die
and render unto our neighbours sevenfold into their bosom their reproach wherewith they have reproached thee o lord
