so far from home into my deeds to pry
to find out shames and idle hours in me
the scope and tenor of thy jealousy
o no thy love though much is not so great
it is my love that keeps mine eye awake
mine own true love that doth my rest defeat
to play the watchman ever for thy sake
 for thee watch i whilst thou dost wake elsewhere
 from me far off with others all too near
lxii
sin of selflove possesseth all mine eye
and all my soul and all my every part
and for this sin there is no remedy
it is so grounded inward in my heart
methinks no face so gracious is as mine
no shape so true no truth of such account
and for myself mine own worth do define
as i all other in all worths surmount
but when my glass shows me myself indeed
beated and chopp'd with tann'd antiquity
mine own selflove quite contrary i read
self so selfloving were iniquity
 tis thee myself that for myself i praise
 painting my age with beauty of thy days
lxiii
against my love shall be as i am now
with time's injurious hand crush'd and o'erworn
when hours have drain'd his blood and fill'd his brow
with lines and wrinkles when his youthful morn
hath travell'd on to age's steepy night
and all those beauties whereof now he's king
are vanishing or vanish'd out of sight
stealing away the treasure of his spring
for such a time do i now fortify
against confounding age's cruel knife
that he shall never cut from memory
my sweet love's beauty though my lover's life
 his beauty shall in these black lines be seen
 and they shall live and he in them still green
lxiv
when i have seen by time's fell hand defaced
the rich proud cost of outworn buried age
when sometime lofty towers i see downrazed
and brass eternal slave to mortal rage
when i have seen the hungry ocean gain
advantage on the kingdom of the shore
and the firm soil win of the watery main
increasing store with loss and loss with store
when i have seen such interchange of state
or state itself confounded to decay
ruin hath taught me thus to ruminate
that time will come and take my love away
 this thought is as a death which cannot choose
 but weep to have that which it fears to lose
lxv
since brass nor stone nor earth nor boundless sea
but sad mortality o'ersways their power
how with this rage shall beauty hold a plea
whose action is no stronger than a flower
o how shall summer's honey breath hold out
against the wreckful siege of battering days
when rocks impregnable are not so stout
nor gates of steel so strong but time decays
o fearful meditation where alack
shall time's best jewel from time's chest lie hid
or what strong hand can hold his swift foot back
or who his spoil of beauty can forbid
 o none unless this miracle have might
 that in black ink my love may still shine bright
lxvi
tired with all these for restful death i cry
as to behold desert a beggar born
and needy nothing trimm'd in jollity
and purest faith unhappily forsworn
and guilded honour shamefully misplaced
and maiden virtue rudely strumpeted
and right perfection wrongfully disgraced
and strength by limping sway disabled
and art made tonguetied by authority
and folly doctorlike controlling skill
and simple truth miscall'd simplicity
and captive good attending captain ill
 tired with all these from these would i be gone
 save that to die i leave my love alone
lxvii
ah wherefore with infection should he live
and with his presence grace impiety
that sin by him advantage should achieve
and lace itself with his society
why should false painting imitate his cheek
and steal dead seeing of his living hue
why should poor beauty indirectly seek
roses of shadow since his rose is true
why should he live now nature bankrupt is
beggar'd of blood to blush through lively veins
for she hath no exchequer now but his
and proud of many lives upon his gains
 o him she stores to show what wealth she had
 in days long since before these last so bad
lxviii
thus is his cheek the map of days outworn
when beauty lived and died as flowers do now
before the bastard signs of fair were born
or durst inhabit on a living brow
before the golden tresses of the dead
the right of sepulchres were shorn away
to live a second life on second head
ere beauty's dead fleece made another gay
in him those holy antique hours are seen
without all ornament itself and true
making no summer of another's green
robbing no old to dress his beauty new
 and him as for a map doth nature store
 to show false art what beauty was of yore
lxix
those parts of thee that the world's eye doth view
want nothing that the thought of hearts can mend
all tongues the voice of souls give thee that due
uttering bare truth even so as foes commend
thy outward thus with outward praise is crown'd
but those same tongues that give thee so thine own
in other accents do this praise confound
by seeing farther than the eye hath shown
they look into the beauty of thy mind
and that in guess they measure by thy deeds
then churls their thoughts although their eyes were kind
to thy fair flower add the rank smell of weeds
 but why thy odour matcheth not thy show
 the solve is this that thou dost common grow
lxx
that thou art blamed shall not be thy defect
for slander's mark was ever yet the fair
the ornament of beauty is suspect
a crow that flies in heaven's sweetest air
so thou be good slander doth but approve
thy worth the greater being woo'd of time
for canker vice the sweetest buds doth love
and thou present'st a pure unstained prime
thou hast pass'd by the ambush of young days
either not assail'd or victor being charged
yet this thy praise cannot be so thy praise
to tie up envy evermore enlarged
 if some suspect of ill mask'd not thy show
 then thou alone kingdoms of hearts shouldst owe
lxxi
no longer mourn for me when i am dead
then you shall hear the surly sullen bell
give warning to the world that i am fled
from this vile world with vilest worms to dwell
nay if you read this line remember not
the hand that writ it for i love you so
that i in your sweet thoughts would be forgot
if thinking on me then should make you woe
o if i say you look upon this verse
when i perhaps compounded am with clay
do not so much as my poor name rehearse
but let your love even with my life decay
 lest the wise world should look into your moan
 and mock you with me after i am gone
lxxii
o lest the world should task you to recite
what merit lived in me that you should love
after my death dear love forget me quite
for you in me can nothing worthy prove
unless you would devise some virtuous lie
to do more for me than mine own desert
and hang more praise upon deceased i
than niggard truth would willingly impart
o lest your true love may seem false in this
that you for love speak well of me untrue
my name be buried where my body is
and live no more to shame nor me nor you
 for i am shamed by that which i bring forth
 and so should you to love things nothing worth
lxxiii
that time of year thou mayst in me behold
when yellow leaves or none or few do hang
upon those boughs which shake against the cold
bare ruin'd choirs where late the sweet birds sang
in me thou seest the twilight of such day
as after sunset fadeth in the west
which by and by black night doth take away
death's second self that seals up all in rest
in me thou see'st the glowing of such fire
that on the ashes of his youth doth lie
as the deathbed whereon it must expire
consumed with that which it was nourish'd by
 this thou perceivest which makes thy love more strong
 to love that well which thou must leave ere long
lxxiv
but be contented when that fell arrest
without all bail shall carry me away
my life hath in this line some interest
which for memorial still with thee shall stay
when thou reviewest this thou dost review
the very part was consecrate to thee
the earth can have but earth which is his due
my spirit is thine the better part of me
so then thou hast but lost the dregs of life
the prey of worms my body being dead
