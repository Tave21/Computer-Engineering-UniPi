act v
scene ii westminster the palace
 enter warwick and the lord chiefjustice meeting
warwick how now my lord chiefjustice whither away
lord chiefjustice how doth the king
warwick exceeding well his cares are now all ended
lord chiefjustice i hope not dead
warwick he's walk'd the way of nature
 and to our purposes he lives no more
lord chiefjustice i would his majesty had call'd me with him
 the service that i truly did his life
 hath left me open to all injuries
warwick indeed i think the young king loves you not
lord chiefjustice i know he doth not and do arm myself
 to welcome the condition of the time
 which cannot look more hideously upon me
 than i have drawn it in my fantasy
 enter lancaster clarence gloucester
 westmoreland and others
warwick here come the heavy issue of dead harry
 o that the living harry had the temper
 of him the worst of these three gentlemen
 how many nobles then should hold their places
 that must strike sail to spirits of vile sort
lord chiefjustice o god i fear all will be overturn'd
lancaster good morrow cousin warwick good morrow
gloucester 
 good morrow cousin
clarence 
lancaster we meet like men that had forgot to speak
warwick we do remember but our argument
 is all too heavy to admit much talk
lancaster well peace be with him that hath made us heavy
lord chiefjustice peace be with us lest we be heavier
gloucester o good my lord you have lost a friend indeed
 and i dare swear you borrow not that face
 of seeming sorrow it is sure your own
lancaster though no man be assured what grace to find
 you stand in coldest expectation
 i am the sorrier would twere otherwise
clarence well you must now speak sir john falstaff fair
 which swims against your stream of quality
lord chiefjustice sweet princes what i did i did in honour
 led by the impartial conduct of my soul
 and never shall you see that i will beg
 a ragged and forestall'd remission
 if truth and upright innocency fail me
 i'll to the king my master that is dead
 and tell him who hath sent me after him
warwick here comes the prince
 enter king henry v attended
lord chiefjustice good morrow and god save your majesty
king henry v this new and gorgeous garment majesty
 sits not so easy on me as you think
 brothers you mix your sadness with some fear
 this is the english not the turkish court
 not amurath an amurath succeeds
 but harry harry yet be sad good brothers
 for by my faith it very well becomes you
 sorrow so royally in you appears
 that i will deeply put the fashion on
 and wear it in my heart why then be sad
 but entertain no more of it good brothers
 than a joint burden laid upon us all
 for me by heaven i bid you be assured
 i'll be your father and your brother too
 let me but bear your love i ll bear your cares
 yet weep that harry's dead and so will i
 but harry lives that shall convert those tears
 by number into hours of happiness
princes we hope no other from your majesty
king henry v you all look strangely on me and you most
 you are i think assured i love you not
lord chiefjustice i am assured if i be measured rightly
 your majesty hath no just cause to hate me
king henry v no
 how might a prince of my great hopes forget
 so great indignities you laid upon me
 what rate rebuke and roughly send to prison
 the immediate heir of england was this easy
 may this be wash'd in lethe and forgotten
lord chiefjustice i then did use the person of your father
 the image of his power lay then in me
 and in the administration of his law
 whiles i was busy for the commonwealth
 your highness pleased to forget my place
 the majesty and power of law and justice
 the image of the king whom i presented
 and struck me in my very seat of judgment
 whereon as an offender to your father
 i gave bold way to my authority
 and did commit you if the deed were ill
 be you contented wearing now the garland
 to have a son set your decrees at nought
 to pluck down justice from your awful bench
 to trip the course of law and blunt the sword
 that guards the peace and safety of your person
 nay more to spurn at your most royal image
 and mock your workings in a second body
 question your royal thoughts make the case yours
 be now the father and propose a son
 hear your own dignity so much profaned
 see your most dreadful laws so loosely slighted
 behold yourself so by a son disdain'd
 and then imagine me taking your part
 and in your power soft silencing your son
 after this cold considerance sentence me
 and as you are a king speak in your state
 what i have done that misbecame my place
 my person or my liege's sovereignty
king henry v you are right justice and you weigh this well
 therefore still bear the balance and the sword
 and i do wish your honours may increase
 till you do live to see a son of mine
 offend you and obey you as i did
 so shall i live to speak my father's words
 happy am i that have a man so bold
 that dares do justice on my proper son
 and not less happy having such a son
 that would deliver up his greatness so
 into the hands of justice you did commit me
 for which i do commit into your hand
 the unstained sword that you have used to bear
 with this remembrance that you use the same
 with the like bold just and impartial spirit
 as you have done gainst me there is my hand
 you shall be as a father to my youth
 my voice shall sound as you do prompt mine ear
 and i will stoop and humble my intents
 to your wellpractised wise directions
 and princes all believe me i beseech you
 my father is gone wild into his grave
 for in his tomb lie my affections
 and with his spirit sadly i survive
 to mock the expectation of the world
 to frustrate prophecies and to raze out
 rotten opinion who hath writ me down
 after my seeming the tide of blood in me
 hath proudly flow'd in vanity till now
 now doth it turn and ebb back to the sea
 where it shall mingle with the state of floods
 and flow henceforth in formal majesty
 now call we our high court of parliament
 and let us choose such limbs of noble counsel
 that the great body of our state may go
 in equal rank with the best govern'd nation
 that war or peace or both at once may be
 as things acquainted and familiar to us
 in which you father shall have foremost hand
 our coronation done we will accite
 as i before remember'd all our state
 and god consigning to my good intents
 no prince nor peer shall have just cause to say
 god shorten harry's happy life one day
