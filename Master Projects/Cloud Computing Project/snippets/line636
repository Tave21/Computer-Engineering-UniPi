 reignier and forces
charles saint denis bless this happy stratagem
 and once again we'll sleep secure in rouen
bastard of orleans here enter'd pucelle and her practisants
 now she is there how will she specify
 where is the best and safest passage in
reignier by thrusting out a torch from yonder tower
 which once discern'd shows that her meaning is
 no way to that for weakness which she enter'd
 enter joan la pucelle on the top thrusting out a
 torch burning
joan la pucelle behold this is the happy wedding torch
 that joineth rouen unto her countrymen
 but burning fatal to the talbotites
 exit
bastard of orleans see noble charles the beacon of our friend
 the burning torch in yonder turret stands
charles now shine it like a comet of revenge
 a prophet to the fall of all our foes
reignier defer no time delays have dangerous ends
 enter and cry the dauphin presently
 and then do execution on the watch
 alarum exeunt
 an alarum enter talbot in an excursion

 hath wrought this hellish mischief unawares
 that hardly we escaped the pride of france
 exit
 an alarum excursions bedford brought in sick
 in a chair enter talbot and burgundy without
 within joan la pucelle charles bastard of orleans
 alencon and reignier on the walls
joan la pucelle good morrow gallants want ye corn for bread
 i think the duke of burgundy will fast
 before he'll buy again at such a rate
 twas full of darnel do you like the taste
burgundy scoff on vile fiend and shameless courtezan
 i trust ere long to choke thee with thine own
 and make thee curse the harvest of that corn
charles your grace may starve perhaps before that time
bedford o let no words but deeds revenge this treason
joan la pucelle what will you do good greybeard break a lance
 and run a tilt at death within a chair
talbot foul fiend of france and hag of all despite
 encompass'd with thy lustful paramours
 becomes it thee to taunt his valiant age
 and twit with cowardice a man half dead
 damsel i'll have a bout with you again
 or else let talbot perish with this shame
joan la pucelle are ye so hot sir yet pucelle hold thy peace
 if talbot do but thunder rain will follow
 the english whisper together in council
 god speed the parliament who shall be the speaker
talbot dare ye come forth and meet us in the field
joan la pucelle belike your lordship takes us then for fools
 to try if that our own be ours or no
talbot i speak not to that railing hecate
 but unto thee alencon and the rest
 will ye like soldiers come and fight it out
alencon signior no
talbot signior hang base muleters of france
 like peasant footboys do they keep the walls
 and dare not take up arms like gentlemen
joan la pucelle away captains let's get us from the walls
 for talbot means no goodness by his looks
 god be wi you my lord we came but to tell you
 that we are here
 exeunt from the walls
talbot and there will we be too ere it be long
 or else reproach be talbot's greatest fame
 vow burgundy by honour of thy house
 prick'd on by public wrongs sustain'd in france
 either to get the town again or die
 and i as sure as english henry lives
 and as his father here was conqueror
 as sure as in this latebetrayed town
 great coeurdelion's heart was buried
 so sure i swear to get the town or die
burgundy my vows are equal partners with thy vows
talbot but ere we go regard this dying prince
 the valiant duke of bedford come my lord
 we will bestow you in some better place
 fitter for sickness and for crazy age
bedford lord talbot do not so dishonour me
 here will i sit before the walls of rouen
 and will be partner of your weal or woe
burgundy courageous bedford let us now persuade you
bedford not to be gone from hence for once i read
 that stout pendragon in his litter sick
 came to the field and vanquished his foes
 methinks i should revive the soldiers hearts
 because i ever found them as myself
talbot undaunted spirit in a dying breast
 then be it so heavens keep old bedford safe
 and now no more ado brave burgundy
 but gather we our forces out of hand
 and set upon our boasting enemy
 exeunt all but bedford and attendants
 an alarum excursions enter fastolfe and
 a captain
captain whither away sir john fastolfe in such haste
fastolfe whither away to save myself by flight
 we are like to have the overthrow again
captain what will you fly and leave lord talbot
fastolfe ay
 all the talbots in the world to save my life
 exit
captain cowardly knight ill fortune follow thee
 exit
 retreat excursions joan la pucelle alencon
 and charles fly
bedford now quiet soul depart when heaven please
 for i have seen our enemies overthrow
 what is the trust or strength of foolish man
 they that of late were daring with their scoffs
 are glad and fain by flight to save themselves
 bedford dies and is carried in by two in his chair
 an alarum reenter talbot burgundy and the rest
talbot lost and recover'd in a day again
 this is a double honour burgundy
 yet heavens have glory for this victory
burgundy warlike and martial talbot burgundy
 enshrines thee in his heart and there erects
 thy noble deeds as valour's monuments
talbot thanks gentle duke but where is pucelle now
 i think her old familiar is asleep
 now where's the bastard's braves and charles his gleeks
 what all amort rouen hangs her head for grief
 that such a valiant company are fled
 now will we take some order in the town
 placing therein some expert officers
 and then depart to paris to the king
 for there young henry with his nobles lie
burgundy what wills lord talbot pleaseth burgundy
talbot but yet before we go let's not forget
 the noble duke of bedford late deceased
 but see his exequies fulfill'd in rouen
 a braver soldier never couched lance
 a gentler heart did never sway in court
 but kings and mightiest potentates must die
 for that's the end of human misery
 exeunt
 1 king henry vi
act iii
scene iii the plains near rouen
 enter charles the bastard of orleans alencon joan
 la pucelle and forces
joan la pucelle dismay not princes at this accident
 nor grieve that rouen is so recovered
 care is no cure but rather corrosive
 for things that are not to be remedied
 let frantic talbot triumph for a while
 and like a peacock sweep along his tail
 we'll pull his plumes and take away his train
 if dauphin and the rest will be but ruled
charles we have been guided by thee hitherto
 and of thy cunning had no diffidence
 one sudden foil shall never breed distrust
bastard of orleans search out thy wit for secret policies
 and we will make thee famous through the world
alencon we'll set thy statue in some holy place
 and have thee reverenced like a blessed saint
 employ thee then sweet virgin for our good
joan la pucelle then thus it must be this doth joan devise
 by fair persuasions mix'd with sugar'd words
 we will entice the duke of burgundy
 to leave the talbot and to follow us
charles ay marry sweeting if we could do that
 france were no place for henry's warriors
 nor should that nation boast it so with us
 but be extirped from our provinces
alencon for ever should they be expulsed from france
 and not have title of an earldom here
joan la pucelle your honours shall perceive how i will work
 to bring this matter to the wished end
 drum sounds afar off
 hark by the sound of drum you may perceive
 their powers are marching unto parisward
 here sound an english march enter and pass over
 at a distance talbot and his forces
 there goes the talbot with his colours spread
 and all the troops of english after him
 french march enter burgundy and forces
 now in the rearward comes the duke and his
 fortune in favour makes him lag behind
 summon a parley we will talk with him
 trumpets sound a parley
charles a parley with the duke of burgundy
