 how that might change his nature there's the question
 it is the bright day that brings forth the adder
 and that craves wary walking crown himthat
 and then i grant we put a sting in him
 that at his will he may do danger with
 the abuse of greatness is when it disjoins
 remorse from power and to speak truth of caesar
 i have not known when his affections sway'd
 more than his reason but tis a common proof
 that lowliness is young ambition's ladder
 whereto the climberupward turns his face
 but when he once attains the upmost round
 he then unto the ladder turns his back
 looks in the clouds scorning the base degrees
 by which he did ascend so caesar may
 then lest he may prevent and since the quarrel
 will bear no colour for the thing he is
 fashion it thus that what he is augmented
 would run to these and these extremities
 and therefore think him as a serpent's egg
 which hatch'd would as his kind grow mischievous
 and kill him in the shell
 reenter lucius
lucius the taper burneth in your closet sir
 searching the window for a flint i found
 this paper thus seal'd up and i am sure
 it did not lie there when i went to bed
 gives him the letter
brutus get you to bed again it is not day
 is not tomorrow boy the ides of march
lucius i know not sir
brutus look in the calendar and bring me word
lucius i will sir
 exit
brutus the exhalations whizzing in the air
 give so much light that i may read by them
 opens the letter and reads
 brutus thou sleep'st awake and see thyself
 shall rome &c speak strike redress
 brutus thou sleep'st awake'
 such instigations have been often dropp'd
 where i have took them up
 shall rome &c thus must i piece it out
 shall rome stand under one man's awe what rome
 my ancestors did from the streets of rome
 the tarquin drive when he was call'd a king
 speak strike redress am i entreated
 to speak and strike o rome i make thee promise
 if the redress will follow thou receivest
 thy full petition at the hand of brutus
 reenter lucius
lucius sir march is wasted fourteen days
 knocking within
brutus tis good go to the gate somebody knocks
 exit lucius
 since cassius first did whet me against caesar
 i have not slept
 between the acting of a dreadful thing
 and the first motion all the interim is
 like a phantasma or a hideous dream
 the genius and the mortal instruments
 are then in council and the state of man
 like to a little kingdom suffers then
 the nature of an insurrection
 reenter lucius
lucius sir tis your brother cassius at the door
 who doth desire to see you
brutus is he alone
lucius no sir there are moe with him
brutus do you know them
lucius no sir their hats are pluck'd about their ears
 and half their faces buried in their cloaks
 that by no means i may discover them
 by any mark of favour
brutus let em enter
 exit lucius
 they are the faction o conspiracy
 shamest thou to show thy dangerous brow by night
 when evils are most free o then by day
 where wilt thou find a cavern dark enough
 to mask thy monstrous visage seek none conspiracy
 hide it in smiles and affability
 for if thou path thy native semblance on
 not erebus itself were dim enough
 to hide thee from prevention
 enter the conspirators cassius casca decius
 brutus cinna metellus cimber and trebonius
cassius i think we are too bold upon your rest
 good morrow brutus do we trouble you
brutus i have been up this hour awake all night
 know i these men that come along with you
cassius yes every man of them and no man here
 but honours you and every one doth wish
 you had but that opinion of yourself
 which every noble roman bears of you
 this is trebonius
brutus he is welcome hither
cassius this decius brutus
brutus he is welcome too
cassius this casca this cinna and this metellus cimber
brutus they are all welcome
 what watchful cares do interpose themselves
 betwixt your eyes and night
cassius shall i entreat a word
 brutus and cassius whisper
decius brutus here lies the east doth not the day break here
casca no
cinna o pardon sir it doth and yon gray lines
 that fret the clouds are messengers of day
casca you shall confess that you are both deceived
 here as i point my sword the sun arises
 which is a great way growing on the south
 weighing the youthful season of the year
 some two months hence up higher toward the north
 he first presents his fire and the high east
 stands as the capitol directly here
brutus give me your hands all over one by one
cassius and let us swear our resolution
brutus no not an oath if not the face of men
 the sufferance of our souls the time's abuse
 if these be motives weak break off betimes
 and every man hence to his idle bed
 so let highsighted tyranny range on
 till each man drop by lottery but if these
 as i am sure they do bear fire enough
 to kindle cowards and to steel with valour
 the melting spirits of women then countrymen
 what need we any spur but our own cause
 to prick us to redress what other bond
 than secret romans that have spoke the word
 and will not palter and what other oath
 than honesty to honesty engaged
 that this shall be or we will fall for it
 swear priests and cowards and men cautelous
 old feeble carrions and such suffering souls
 that welcome wrongs unto bad causes swear
 such creatures as men doubt but do not stain
 the even virtue of our enterprise
 nor the insuppressive mettle of our spirits
 to think that or our cause or our performance
 did need an oath when every drop of blood
 that every roman bears and nobly bears
 is guilty of a several bastardy
 if he do break the smallest particle
 of any promise that hath pass'd from him
cassius but what of cicero shall we sound him
 i think he will stand very strong with us
casca let us not leave him out
cinna no by no means
metellus cimber o let us have him for his silver hairs
 will purchase us a good opinion
 and buy men's voices to commend our deeds
 it shall be said his judgment ruled our hands
 our youths and wildness shall no whit appear
 but all be buried in his gravity
brutus o name him not let us not break with him
 for he will never follow any thing
 that other men begin
cassius then leave him out
casca indeed he is not fit
decius brutus shall no man else be touch'd but only caesar
cassius decius well urged i think it is not meet
 mark antony so well beloved of caesar
 should outlive caesar we shall find of him
 a shrewd contriver and you know his means
 if he improve them may well stretch so far
 as to annoy us all which to prevent
 let antony and caesar fall together
brutus our course will seem too bloody caius cassius
 to cut the head off and then hack the limbs
 like wrath in death and envy afterwards
 for antony is but a limb of caesar
 let us be sacrificers but not butchers caius
 we all stand up against the spirit of caesar
 and in the spirit of men there is no blood
 o that we then could come by caesar's spirit
 and not dismember caesar but alas
 caesar must bleed for it and gentle friends
 let's kill him boldly but not wrathfully
 let's carve him as a dish fit for the gods
 not hew him as a carcass fit for hounds
 and let our hearts as subtle masters do
 stir up their servants to an act of rage
 and after seem to chide em this shall make
 our purpose necessary and not envious
 which so appearing to the common eyes
 we shall be call'd purgers not murderers
 and for mark antony think not of him
 for he can do no more than caesar's arm
 when caesar's head is off
cassius yet i fear him
 for in the ingrafted love he bears to caesar
brutus alas good cassius do not think of him
 if he love caesar all that he can do
 is to himself take thought and die for caesar
 and that were much he should for he is given
 to sports to wildness and much company
trebonius there is no fear in him let him not die
 for he will live and laugh at this hereafter
 clock strikes
