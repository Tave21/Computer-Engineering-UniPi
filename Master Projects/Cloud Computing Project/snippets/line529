 an old italian fox is not so kind my boy
 exit
tranio a vengeance on your crafty wither'd hide
 yet i have faced it with a card of ten
 tis in my head to do my master good
 i see no reason but supposed lucentio
 must get a father call'd supposed vincentio'
 and that's a wonder fathers commonly
 do get their children but in this case of wooing
 a child shall get a sire if i fail not of my cunning

act iii
scene i padua baptista's house
 enter lucentio hortensio and bianca
lucentio fiddler forbear you grow too forward sir
 have you so soon forgot the entertainment
 her sister katharina welcomed you withal
hortensio but wrangling pedant this is
 the patroness of heavenly harmony
 then give me leave to have prerogative
 and when in music we have spent an hour
 your lecture shall have leisure for as much
lucentio preposterous ass that never read so far
 to know the cause why music was ordain'd
 was it not to refresh the mind of man
 after his studies or his usual pain
 then give me leave to read philosophy
 and while i pause serve in your harmony
hortensio sirrah i will not bear these braves of thine
bianca why gentlemen you do me double wrong
 to strive for that which resteth in my choice
 i am no breeching scholar in the schools
 i'll not be tied to hours nor pointed times
 but learn my lessons as i please myself
 and to cut off all strife here sit we down
 take you your instrument play you the whiles
 his lecture will be done ere you have tuned
hortensio you'll leave his lecture when i am in tune
lucentio that will be never tune your instrument
bianca where left we last
lucentio here madam
 hic ibat simois hic est sigeia tellus
 hic steterat priami regia celsa senis'
bianca construe them
lucentio hic ibat as i told you before simois i am
 lucentio hic est son unto vincentio of pisa
 sigeia tellus disguised thus to get your love
 hic steterat and that lucentio that comes
 awooing priami is my man tranio regia'
 bearing my port celsa senis that we might
 beguile the old pantaloon
hortensio madam my instrument's in tune
bianca let's hear o fie the treble jars
lucentio spit in the hole man and tune again
bianca now let me see if i can construe it hic ibat
 simois i know you not hic est sigeia tellus i
 trust you not hic steterat priami take heed
 he hear us not regia presume not celsa senis'
 despair not
hortensio madam tis now in tune
lucentio all but the base
hortensio the base is right tis the base knave that jars
 aside
 how fiery and forward our pedant is
 now for my life the knave doth court my love
 pedascule i'll watch you better yet
bianca in time i may believe yet i mistrust
lucentio mistrust it not for sure aeacides
 was ajax call'd so from his grandfather
bianca i must believe my master else i promise you
 i should be arguing still upon that doubt
 but let it rest now licio to you
 good masters take it not unkindly pray
 that i have been thus pleasant with you both
hortensio you may go walk and give me leave a while
 my lessons make no music in three parts
lucentio are you so formal sir well i must wait
 aside
 and watch withal for but i be deceived
 our fine musician groweth amorous
hortensio madam before you touch the instrument
 to learn the order of my fingering
 i must begin with rudiments of art
 to teach you gamut in a briefer sort
 more pleasant pithy and effectual
 than hath been taught by any of my trade
 and there it is in writing fairly drawn
bianca why i am past my gamut long ago
hortensio yet read the gamut of hortensio
bianca reads 'gamut i am the ground of all accord
 a re to plead hortensio's passion
 b mi bianca take him for thy lord
 c fa ut that loves with all affection
 d sol re one clef two notes have i
 e la mi show pity or i die'
 call you this gamut tut i like it not
 old fashions please me best i am not so nice
 to change true rules for old inventions
 enter a servant
servant mistress your father prays you leave your books
 and help to dress your sister's chamber up
 you know tomorrow is the weddingday
bianca farewell sweet masters both i must be gone
 exeunt bianca and servant
lucentio faith mistress then i have no cause to stay
 exit
hortensio but i have cause to pry into this pedant
 methinks he looks as though he were in love
 yet if thy thoughts bianca be so humble
 to cast thy wandering eyes on every stale
 seize thee that list if once i find thee ranging
 hortensio will be quit with thee by changing
 exit

act iii
scene ii padua before baptista's house
 enter baptista gremio tranio katharina bianca
 lucentio and others attendants
baptista to tranio signior lucentio this is the
 pointed day
 that katharina and petruchio should be married
 and yet we hear not of our soninlaw
 what will be said what mockery will it be
 to want the bridegroom when the priest attends
 to speak the ceremonial rites of marriage
 what says lucentio to this shame of ours
katharina no shame but mine i must forsooth be forced
 to give my hand opposed against my heart
 unto a madbrain rudesby full of spleen
 who woo'd in haste and means to wed at leisure
 i told you i he was a frantic fool
 hiding his bitter jests in blunt behavior
 and to be noted for a merry man
 he'll woo a thousand point the day of marriage
 make feasts invite friends and proclaim the banns
 yet never means to wed where he hath woo'd
 now must the world point at poor katharina
 and say lo there is mad petruchio's wife
 if it would please him come and marry her'
tranio patience good katharina and baptista too
 upon my life petruchio means but well
 whatever fortune stays him from his word
 though he be blunt i know him passing wise
 though he be merry yet withal he's honest
katharina would katharina had never seen him though
 exit weeping followed by bianca and others
baptista go girl i cannot blame thee now to weep
 for such an injury would vex a very saint
 much more a shrew of thy impatient humour
 enter biondello
biondello master master news old news and such news as
 you never heard of
baptista is it new and old too how may that be
biondello why is it not news to hear of petruchio's coming
baptista is he come
biondello why no sir
baptista what then
biondello he is coming
baptista when will he be here
biondello when he stands where i am and sees you there
tranio but say what to thine old news
biondello why petruchio is coming in a new hat and an old
 jerkin a pair of old breeches thrice turned a pair
 of boots that have been candlecases one buckled
 another laced an old rusty sword ta'en out of the
 townarmory with a broken hilt and chapeless
 with two broken points his horse hipped with an
 old mothy saddle and stirrups of no kindred
 besides possessed with the glanders and like to mose
 in the chine troubled with the lampass infected
 with the fashions full of wingdalls sped with
 spavins rayed with yellows past cure of the fives
 stark spoiled with the staggers begnawn with the
 bots swayed in the back and shouldershotten
 nearlegged before and with a halfchequed bit
 and a headstall of sheeps leather which being
 restrained to keep him from stumbling hath been
 often burst and now repaired with knots one girth
 six time pieced and a woman's crupper of velure
 which hath two letters for her name fairly set down
 in studs and here and there pieced with packthread
baptista who comes with him
biondello o sir his lackey for all the world caparisoned
 like the horse with a linen stock on one leg and a
 kersey boothose on the other gartered with a red
 and blue list an old hat and the humour of forty
 fancies pricked in't for a feather a monster a
 very monster in apparel and not like a christian
 footboy or a gentleman's lackey
tranio tis some odd humour pricks him to this fashion
 yet oftentimes he goes but meanapparell'd
baptista i am glad he's come howsoe'er he comes
biondello why sir he comes not
baptista didst thou not say he comes
biondello who that petruchio came
baptista ay that petruchio came
biondello no sir i say his horse comes with him on his back
baptista why that's all one
