act iv
scene iv a room in ford's house
 enter page ford mistress page mistress ford
 and sir hugh evans
sir hugh evans tis one of the best discretions of a oman as ever
 i did look upon
page and did he send you both these letters at an instant
mistress page within a quarter of an hour
ford pardon me wife henceforth do what thou wilt
 i rather will suspect the sun with cold
 than thee with wantonness now doth thy honour stand
 in him that was of late an heretic
 as firm as faith
page tis well tis well no more
 be not as extreme in submission
 as in offence
 but let our plot go forward let our wives
 yet once again to make us public sport
 appoint a meeting with this old fat fellow
 where we may take him and disgrace him for it
ford there is no better way than that they spoke of
page how to send him word they'll meet him in the park
 at midnight fie fie he'll never come
sir hugh evans you say he has been thrown in the rivers and has
 been grievously peaten as an old oman methinks
 there should be terrors in him that he should not
 come methinks his flesh is punished he shall have
 no desires
page so think i too
mistress ford devise but how you'll use him when he comes
 and let us two devise to bring him thither
mistress page there is an old tale goes that herne the hunter
 sometime a keeper here in windsor forest
 doth all the wintertime at still midnight
 walk round about an oak with great ragg'd horns
 and there he blasts the tree and takes the cattle
 and makes milchkine yield blood and shakes a chain
 in a most hideous and dreadful manner
 you have heard of such a spirit and well you know
 the superstitious idleheaded eld
 received and did deliver to our age
 this tale of herne the hunter for a truth
page why yet there want not many that do fear
 in deep of night to walk by this herne's oak
 but what of this
mistress ford marry this is our device
 that falstaff at that oak shall meet with us
page well let it not be doubted but he'll come
 and in this shape when you have brought him thither
 what shall be done with him what is your plot
mistress page that likewise have we thought upon and thus
 nan page my daughter and my little son
 and three or four more of their growth we'll dress
 like urchins ouphes and fairies green and white
 with rounds of waxen tapers on their heads
 and rattles in their hands upon a sudden
 as falstaff she and i are newly met
 let them from forth a sawpit rush at once
 with some diffused song upon their sight
 we two in great amazedness will fly
 then let them all encircle him about
 and fairylike topinch the unclean knight
 and ask him why that hour of fairy revel
 in their so sacred paths he dares to tread
 in shape profane
mistress ford and till he tell the truth
 let the supposed fairies pinch him sound
 and burn him with their tapers
mistress page the truth being known
 we'll all present ourselves dishorn the spirit
 and mock him home to windsor
ford the children must
 be practised well to this or they'll ne'er do't
sir hugh evans i will teach the children their behaviors and i
 will be like a jackanapes also to burn the
 knight with my taber
ford that will be excellent i'll go and buy them vizards
mistress page my nan shall be the queen of all the fairies
 finely attired in a robe of white
page that silk will i go buy
 aside
 and in that time
 shall master slender steal my nan away
 and marry her at eton go send to falstaff straight
ford nay i'll to him again in name of brook
 he'll tell me all his purpose sure he'll come
mistress page fear not you that go get us properties
 and tricking for our fairies
sir hugh evans let us about it it is admirable pleasures and fery
 honest knaveries
 exeunt page ford and sir hugh evans
mistress page go mistress ford
 send quickly to sir john to know his mind
 exit mistress ford
 i'll to the doctor he hath my good will
 and none but he to marry with nan page
 that slender though well landed is an idiot
