and my great mind most kingly drinks it up
mine eye well knows what with his gust is greeing
and to his palate doth prepare the cup
 if it be poison'd tis the lesser sin
 that mine eye loves it and doth first begin
cxv
those lines that i before have writ do lie
even those that said i could not love you dearer
yet then my judgment knew no reason why
my most full flame should afterwards burn clearer
but reckoning time whose million'd accidents
creep in twixt vows and change decrees of kings
tan sacred beauty blunt the sharp'st intents
divert strong minds to the course of altering things
alas why fearing of time's tyranny
might i not then say now i love you best'
when i was certain o'er incertainty
crowning the present doubting of the rest
 love is a babe then might i not say so
 to give full growth to that which still doth grow
cxvi
let me not to the marriage of true minds
admit impediments love is not love
which alters when it alteration finds
or bends with the remover to remove
o no it is an everfixed mark
that looks on tempests and is never shaken
it is the star to every wandering bark
whose worth's unknown although his height be taken
love's not time's fool though rosy lips and cheeks
within his bending sickle's compass come
love alters not with his brief hours and weeks
but bears it out even to the edge of doom
 if this be error and upon me proved
 i never writ nor no man ever loved
cxvii
accuse me thus that i have scanted all
wherein i should your great deserts repay
forgot upon your dearest love to call
whereto all bonds do tie me day by day
that i have frequent been with unknown minds
and given to time your own dearpurchased right
that i have hoisted sail to all the winds
which should transport me farthest from your sight
book both my wilfulness and errors down
and on just proof surmise accumulate
bring me within the level of your frown
but shoot not at me in your waken'd hate
 since my appeal says i did strive to prove
 the constancy and virtue of your love
cxviii
like as to make our appetites more keen
with eager compounds we our palate urge
as to prevent our maladies unseen
we sicken to shun sickness when we purge
even so being tuff of your ne'ercloying sweetness
to bitter sauces did i frame my feeding
and sick of welfare found a kind of meetness
to be diseased ere that there was true needing
thus policy in love to anticipate
the ills that were not grew to faults assured
and brought to medicine a healthful state
which rank of goodness would by ill be cured
 but thence i learn and find the lesson true
 drugs poison him that so fell sick of you
cxix
what potions have i drunk of siren tears
distill'd from limbecks foul as hell within
applying fears to hopes and hopes to fears
still losing when i saw myself to win
what wretched errors hath my heart committed
whilst it hath thought itself so blessed never
how have mine eyes out of their spheres been fitted
in the distraction of this madding fever
o benefit of ill now i find true
that better is by evil still made better
and ruin'd love when it is built anew
grows fairer than at first more strong far greater
 so i return rebuked to my content
 and gain by ill thrice more than i have spent
cxx
that you were once unkind befriends me now
and for that sorrow which i then did feel
needs must i under my transgression bow
unless my nerves were brass or hammer'd steel
for if you were by my unkindness shaken
as i by yours you've pass'd a hell of time
and i a tyrant have no leisure taken
to weigh how once i suffered in your crime
o that our night of woe might have remember'd
my deepest sense how hard true sorrow hits
and soon to you as you to me then tender'd
the humble slave which wounded bosoms fits
 but that your trespass now becomes a fee
 mine ransoms yours and yours must ransom me
cxxi
'tis better to be vile than vile esteem'd
when not to be receives reproach of being
and the just pleasure lost which is so deem'd
not by our feeling but by others seeing
for why should others false adulterate eyes
give salutation to my sportive blood
or on my frailties why are frailer spies
which in their wills count bad what i think good
no i am that i am and they that level
at my abuses reckon up their own
i may be straight though they themselves be bevel
by their rank thoughts my deeds must not be shown
 unless this general evil they maintain
 all men are bad and in their badness reign
cxxii
thy gift thy tables are within my brain
full character'd with lasting memory
which shall above that idle rank remain
beyond all date even to eternity
or at the least so long as brain and heart
have faculty by nature to subsist
till each to razed oblivion yield his part
of thee thy record never can be miss'd
that poor retention could not so much hold
nor need i tallies thy dear love to score
therefore to give them from me was i bold
to trust those tables that receive thee more
 to keep an adjunct to remember thee
 were to import forgetfulness in me
cxxiii
no time thou shalt not boast that i do change
thy pyramids built up with newer might
to me are nothing novel nothing strange
they are but dressings of a former sight
our dates are brief and therefore we admire
what thou dost foist upon us that is old
and rather make them born to our desire
than think that we before have heard them told
thy registers and thee i both defy
not wondering at the present nor the past
for thy records and what we see doth lie
made more or less by thy continual haste
 this i do vow and this shall ever be
 i will be true despite thy scythe and thee
cxxiv
if my dear love were but the child of state
it might for fortune's bastard be unfather'd'
as subject to time's love or to time's hate
weeds among weeds or flowers with flowers gather'd
no it was builded far from accident
it suffers not in smiling pomp nor falls
under the blow of thralled discontent
whereto the inviting time our fashion calls
it fears not policy that heretic
which works on leases of shortnumber'd hours
but all alone stands hugely politic
that it nor grows with heat nor drowns with showers
 to this i witness call the fools of time
 which die for goodness who have lived for crime
cxxv
were t aught to me i bore the canopy
with my extern the outward honouring
or laid great bases for eternity
which prove more short than waste or ruining
have i not seen dwellers on form and favour
lose all and more by paying too much rent
for compound sweet forgoing simple savour
pitiful thrivers in their gazing spent
no let me be obsequious in thy heart
and take thou my oblation poor but free
which is not mix'd with seconds knows no art
but mutual render only me for thee
 hence thou suborn'd informer a true soul
 when most impeach'd stands least in thy control
cxxvi
o thou my lovely boy who in thy power
dost hold time's fickle glass his sickle hour
who hast by waning grown and therein show'st
thy lovers withering as thy sweet self grow'st
if nature sovereign mistress over wrack
as thou goest onwards still will pluck thee back
she keeps thee to this purpose that her skill
may time disgrace and wretched minutes kill
yet fear her o thou minion of her pleasure
she may detain but not still keep her treasure
 her audit though delay'd answer'd must be
 and her quietus is to render thee
cxxvii
in the old age black was not counted fair
or if it were it bore not beauty's name
but now is black beauty's successive heir
and beauty slander'd with a bastard shame
for since each hand hath put on nature's power
fairing the foul with art's false borrow'd face
sweet beauty hath no name no holy bower
but is profaned if not lives in disgrace
therefore my mistress brows are raven black
her eyes so suited and they mourners seem
at such who not born fair no beauty lack
slandering creation with a false esteem
 yet so they mourn becoming of their woe
 that every tongue says beauty should look so
cxxviii
how oft when thou my music music play'st
