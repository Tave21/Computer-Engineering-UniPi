aufidius wert thou the hector
 that was the whip of your bragg'd progeny
 thou shouldst not scape me here
 they fight and certain volsces come to the aid of
 aufidius marcius fights till they be driven in
 breathless
 officious and not valiant you have shamed me
 in your condemned seconds
 exeunt
 coriolanus
act i
scene ix the roman camp
 flourish alarum a retreat is sounded flourish
 enter from one side cominius with the romans from
 the other side marcius with his arm in a scarf
cominius if i should tell thee o'er this thy day's work
 thou'ldst not believe thy deeds but i'll report it
 where senators shall mingle tears with smiles
 where great patricians shall attend and shrug
 i the end admire where ladies shall be frighted
 and gladly quaked hear more where the
 dull tribunes
 that with the fusty plebeians hate thine honours
 shall say against their hearts we thank the gods
 our rome hath such a soldier'
 yet camest thou to a morsel of this feast
 having fully dined before
 enter titus lartius with his power
 from the pursuit
lartius o general
 here is the steed we the caparison
 hadst thou beheld
marcius pray now no more my mother
 who has a charter to extol her blood
 when she does praise me grieves me i have done
 as you have done that's what i can induced
 as you have been that's for my country
 he that has but effected his good will
 hath overta'en mine act
cominius you shall not be
 the grave of your deserving rome must know
 the value of her own twere a concealment
 worse than a theft no less than a traducement
 to hide your doings and to silence that
 which to the spire and top of praises vouch'd
 would seem but modest therefore i beseech you
 in sign of what you are not to reward
 what you have donebefore our army hear me
marcius i have some wounds upon me and they smart
 to hear themselves remember'd
cominius should they not
 well might they fester gainst ingratitude
 and tent themselves with death of all the horses
 whereof we have ta'en good and good store of all
 the treasure in this field achieved and city
 we render you the tenth to be ta'en forth
 before the common distribution at
 your only choice
marcius i thank you general
 but cannot make my heart consent to take
 a bribe to pay my sword i do refuse it
 and stand upon my common part with those
 that have beheld the doing
 a long flourish they all cry marcius marcius'
 cast up their caps and lances cominius and lartius
 stand bare
marcius may these same instruments which you profane
 never sound more when drums and trumpets shall
 i the field prove flatterers let courts and cities be
 made all of falsefaced soothing
 when steel grows soft as the parasite's silk
 let him be made a coverture for the wars
 no more i say for that i have not wash'd
 my nose that bled or foil'd some debile wretch
 which without note here's many else have done
 you shout me forth
 in acclamations hyperbolical
 as if i loved my little should be dieted
 in praises sauced with lies
cominius too modest are you
 more cruel to your good report than grateful
 to us that give you truly by your patience
 if gainst yourself you be incensed we'll put you
 like one that means his proper harm in manacles
 then reason safely with you therefore be it known
 as to us to all the world that caius marcius
 wears this war's garland in token of the which
 my noble steed known to the camp i give him
 with all his trim belonging and from this time
 for what he did before corioli call him
 with all the applause and clamour of the host
 caius marcius coriolanus bear
 the addition nobly ever
 flourish trumpets sound and drums
all caius marcius coriolanus
coriolanus i will go wash
 and when my face is fair you shall perceive
 whether i blush or no howbeit i thank you
 i mean to stride your steed and at all times
 to undercrest your good addition
 to the fairness of my power
cominius so to our tent
 where ere we do repose us we will write
 to rome of our success you titus lartius
 must to corioli back send us to rome
 the best with whom we may articulate
 for their own good and ours
lartius i shall my lord
coriolanus the gods begin to mock me i that now
 refused most princely gifts am bound to beg
 of my lord general
cominius take't tis yours what is't
coriolanus i sometime lay here in corioli
 at a poor man's house he used me kindly
 he cried to me i saw him prisoner
 but then aufidius was within my view
 and wrath o'erwhelm'd my pity i request you
 to give my poor host freedom
cominius o well begg'd
 were he the butcher of my son he should
 be free as is the wind deliver him titus
lartius marcius his name
coriolanus by jupiter forgot
 i am weary yea my memory is tired
 have we no wine here
cominius go we to our tent
 the blood upon your visage dries tis time
 it should be look'd to come

scene x the camp of the volsces
 a flourish cornets enter tullus aufidius
 bloody with two or three soldiers
aufidius the town is ta'en
first soldier twill be deliver'd back on good condition
aufidius condition
 i would i were a roman for i cannot
 being a volsce be that i am condition
 what good condition can a treaty find
 i the part that is at mercy five times marcius
 i have fought with thee so often hast thou beat me
 and wouldst do so i think should we encounter
 as often as we eat by the elements
 if e'er again i meet him beard to beard
 he's mine or i am his mine emulation
 hath not that honour in't it had for where
 i thought to crush him in an equal force
 true sword to sword i'll potch at him some way
 or wrath or craft may get him
first soldier he's the devil
aufidius bolder though not so subtle my valour's poison'd
 with only suffering stain by him for him
 shall fly out of itself nor sleep nor sanctuary
 being naked sick nor fane nor capitol
 the prayers of priests nor times of sacrifice
 embarquements all of fury shall lift up
 their rotten privilege and custom gainst
 my hate to marcius where i find him were it
 at home upon my brother's guard even there
 against the hospitable canon would i
 wash my fierce hand in's heart go you to the city
 learn how tis held and what they are that must
 be hostages for rome
first soldier will not you go
aufidius i am attended at the cypress grove i pray you
 tis south the city millsbring me word thither
 how the world goes that to the pace of it
 i may spur on my journey
first soldier i shall sir

act ii
scene i rome a public place
 enter menenius with the two tribunes of the people
 sicinius and brutus
menenius the augurer tells me we shall have news tonight
brutus good or bad
menenius not according to the prayer of the people for they
 love not marcius
sicinius nature teaches beasts to know their friends
menenius pray you who does the wolf love
sicinius the lamb
menenius ay to devour him as the hungry plebeians would the
 noble marcius
brutus he's a lamb indeed that baes like a bear
menenius he's a bear indeed that lives like a lamb you two
 are old men tell me one thing that i shall ask you
both well sir
menenius in what enormity is marcius poor in that you two
 have not in abundance
brutus he's poor in no one fault but stored with all
sicinius especially in pride
brutus and topping all others in boasting
menenius this is strange now do you two know how you are
 censured here in the city i mean of us o the
 righthand file do you
both why how are we censured
menenius because you talk of pride nowwill you not be angry
both well well sir well
