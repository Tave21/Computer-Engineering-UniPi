 that for the health and physic of our right
 we cannot deal but with the very hand
 of stern injustice and confused wrong
 and is't not pity o my grieved friends
 that we the sons and children of this isle
 were born to see so sad an hour as this
 wherein we step after a stranger march
 upon her gentle bosom and fill up
 her enemies ranksi must withdraw and weep
 upon the spot of this enforced cause
 to grace the gentry of a land remote
 and follow unacquainted colours here
 what here o nation that thou couldst remove
 that neptune's arms who clippeth thee about
 would bear thee from the knowledge of thyself
 and grapple thee unto a pagan shore
 where these two christian armies might combine
 the blood of malice in a vein of league
 and not to spend it so unneighbourly
lewis a noble temper dost thou show in this
 and great affections wrestling in thy bosom
 doth make an earthquake of nobility
 o what a noble combat hast thou fought
 between compulsion and a brave respect
 let me wipe off this honourable dew
 that silverly doth progress on thy cheeks
 my heart hath melted at a lady's tears
 being an ordinary inundation
 but this effusion of such manly drops
 this shower blown up by tempest of the soul
 startles mine eyes and makes me more amazed
 than had i seen the vaulty top of heaven
 figured quite o'er with burning meteors
 lift up thy brow renowned salisbury
 and with a great heart heave away the storm
 commend these waters to those baby eyes
 that never saw the giant world enraged
 nor met with fortune other than at feasts
 full of warm blood of mirth of gossiping
 come come for thou shalt thrust thy hand as deep
 into the purse of rich prosperity
 as lewis himself so nobles shall you all
 that knit your sinews to the strength of mine
 and even there methinks an angel spake
 enter cardinal pandulph
 look where the holy legate comes apace
 to give us warrant from the hand of heaven
 and on our actions set the name of right
 with holy breath
cardinal pandulph hail noble prince of france
 the next is this king john hath reconciled
 himself to rome his spirit is come in
 that so stood out against the holy church
 the great metropolis and see of rome
 therefore thy threatening colours now wind up
 and tame the savage spirit of wild war
 that like a lion foster'd up at hand
 it may lie gently at the foot of peace
 and be no further harmful than in show
lewis your grace shall pardon me i will not back
 i am too highborn to be propertied
 to be a secondary at control
 or useful servingman and instrument
 to any sovereign state throughout the world
 your breath first kindled the dead coal of wars
 between this chastised kingdom and myself
 and brought in matter that should feed this fire
 and now tis far too huge to be blown out
 with that same weak wind which enkindled it
 you taught me how to know the face of right
 acquainted me with interest to this land
 yea thrust this enterprise into my heart
 and come ye now to tell me john hath made
 his peace with rome what is that peace to me
 i by the honour of my marriagebed
 after young arthur claim this land for mine
 and now it is halfconquer'd must i back
 because that john hath made his peace with rome
 am i rome's slave what penny hath rome borne
 what men provided what munition sent
 to underprop this action is't not i
 that undergo this charge who else but i
 and such as to my claim are liable
 sweat in this business and maintain this war
 have i not heard these islanders shout out
 vive le roi as i have bank'd their towns
 have i not here the best cards for the game
 to win this easy match play'd for a crown
 and shall i now give o'er the yielded set
 no no on my soul it never shall be said
cardinal pandulph you look but on the outside of this work
lewis outside or inside i will not return
 till my attempt so much be glorified
 as to my ample hope was promised
 before i drew this gallant head of war
 and cull'd these fiery spirits from the world
 to outlook conquest and to win renown
 even in the jaws of danger and of death
 trumpet sounds
 what lusty trumpet thus doth summon us
 enter the bastard attended
bastard according to the fair play of the world
 let me have audience i am sent to speak
 my holy lord of milan from the king
 i come to learn how you have dealt for him
 and as you answer i do know the scope
 and warrant limited unto my tongue
cardinal pandulph the dauphin is too wilfulopposite
 and will not temporize with my entreaties
 he flatly says he'll not lay down his arms
bastard by all the blood that ever fury breathed
 the youth says well now hear our english king
 for thus his royalty doth speak in me
 he is prepared and reason too he should
 this apish and unmannerly approach
 this harness'd masque and unadvised revel
 this unhair'd sauciness and boyish troops
 the king doth smile at and is well prepared
 to whip this dwarfish war these pigmy arms
 from out the circle of his territories
 that hand which had the strength even at your door
 to cudgel you and make you take the hatch
 to dive like buckets in concealed wells
 to crouch in litter of your stable planks
 to lie like pawns lock'd up in chests and trunks
 to hug with swine to seek sweet safety out
 in vaults and prisons and to thrill and shake
 even at the crying of your nation's crow
 thinking his voice an armed englishman
 shall that victorious hand be feebled here
 that in your chambers gave you chastisement
 no know the gallant monarch is in arms
 and like an eagle o'er his aery towers
 to souse annoyance that comes near his nest
 and you degenerate you ingrate revolts
 you bloody neroes ripping up the womb
 of your dear mother england blush for shame
 for your own ladies and palevisaged maids
 like amazons come tripping after drums
 their thimbles into armed gauntlets change
 their needles to lances and their gentle hearts
 to fierce and bloody inclination
lewis there end thy brave and turn thy face in peace
 we grant thou canst outscold us fare thee well
 we hold our time too precious to be spent
 with such a brabbler
cardinal pandulph give me leave to speak
bastard no i will speak
lewis we will attend to neither
 strike up the drums and let the tongue of war
 plead for our interest and our being here
bastard indeed your drums being beaten will cry out
 and so shall you being beaten do but start
 an echo with the clamour of thy drum
 and even at hand a drum is ready braced
 that shall reverberate all as loud as thine
 sound but another and another shall
 as loud as thine rattle the welkin's ear
 and mock the deepmouth'd thunder for at hand
 not trusting to this halting legate here
 whom he hath used rather for sport than need
 is warlike john and in his forehead sits
 a bareribb'd death whose office is this day
 to feast upon whole thousands of the french
lewis strike up our drums to find this danger out
bastard and thou shalt find it dauphin do not doubt
 exeunt
 king john
act v
scene iii the field of battle
 alarums enter king john and hubert
king john how goes the day with us o tell me hubert
hubert badly i fear how fares your majesty
king john this fever that hath troubled me so long
 lies heavy on me o my heart is sick
 enter a messenger
messenger my lord your valiant kinsman faulconbridge
 desires your majesty to leave the field
 and send him word by me which way you go
king john tell him toward swinstead to the abbey there
messenger be of good comfort for the great supply
 that was expected by the dauphin here
 are wreck'd three nights ago on goodwin sands
 this news was brought to richard but even now
 the french fight coldly and retire themselves
king john ay me this tyrant fever burns me up
 and will not let me welcome this good news
 set on toward swinstead to my litter straight
 weakness possesseth me and i am faint
 exeunt
 king john
act v
scene iv another part of the field
 enter salisbury pembroke and bigot
salisbury i did not think the king so stored with friends
pembroke up once again put spirit in the french
 if they miscarry we miscarry too
salisbury that misbegotten devil faulconbridge
 in spite of spite alone upholds the day
pembroke they say king john sore sick hath left the field
