 madam my lord will go away tonight
 a very serious business calls on him
 the great prerogative and rite of love
 which as your due time claims he does acknowledge
 but puts it off to a compell'd restraint
 whose want and whose delay is strew'd with sweets
 which they distil now in the curbed time
 to make the coming hour o'erflow with joy
 and pleasure drown the brim
helena what's his will else
parolles that you will take your instant leave o the king
 and make this haste as your own good proceeding
 strengthen'd with what apology you think
 may make it probable need

 attend his further pleasure

bertram is there any unkindness between my lord and you monsieur
parolles i know not how i have deserved to run into my lord's
 displeasure

lafeu and shall do so ever though i took him at s
 prayers fare you well my lord and believe this

 you must not marvel helen at my course
 which holds not colour with the time nor does
 the ministration and required office
 on my particular prepared i was not
 for such a business therefore am i found
 so much unsettled this drives me to entreat you
 that presently you take our way for home
 and rather muse than ask why i entreat you
 for my respects are better than they seem
 and my appointments have in them a need
 greater than shows itself at the first view
 to you that know them not this to my mother
 giving a letter
 twill be two days ere i shall see you so
 i leave you to your wisdom
helena sir i can nothing say
 but that i am your most obedient servant
bertram come come no more of that

 with true observance seek to eke out that
 wherein toward me my homely stars have fail'd
 to equal my great fortune
bertram let that go
 my haste is very great farewell hie home
helena pray sir your pardon
bertram well what would you say
helena i am not worthy of the wealth i owe
 nor dare i say tis mine and yet it is
 but like a timorous thief most fain would steal
 what law does vouch mine own
bertram what would you have
helena something and scarce so much nothing indeed
 i would not tell you what i would my lord
 faith yes
 strangers and foes do sunder and not kiss
bertram i pray you stay not but in haste to horse
helena i shall not break your bidding good my lord

 whilst i can shake my sword or hear the drum
 away and for our flight

scene i florence the duke's palace
 flourish enter the duke of florence attended
 the two frenchmen with a troop of soldiers
duke so that from point to point now have you heard
 the fundamental reasons of this war
 whose great decision hath much blood let forth
 and more thirsts after
first lord holy seems the quarrel
 upon your grace's part black and fearful
 on the opposer
duke therefore we marvel much our cousin france
 would in so just a business shut his bosom
 against our borrowing prayers
second lord good my lord
 the reasons of our state i cannot yield
 but like a common and an outward man
 that the great figure of a council frames
 by selfunable motion therefore dare not
 say what i think of it since i have found
 myself in my incertain grounds to fail
 as often as i guess'd
duke be it his pleasure
first lord but i am sure the younger of our nature
 that surfeit on their ease will day by day
 come here for physic
duke welcome shall they be
 and all the honours that can fly from us
 shall on them settle you know your places well
 when better fall for your avails they fell
 tomorrow to the field
