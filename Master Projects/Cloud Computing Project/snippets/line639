 two mightier troops than that the dauphin led
 which join'd with him and made their march for bourdeaux
york a plague upon that villain somerset
 that thus delays my promised supply
 of horsemen that were levied for this siege
 renowned talbot doth expect my aid
 and i am lowted by a traitor villain
 and cannot help the noble chevalier
 god comfort him in this necessity
 if he miscarry farewell wars in france
 enter sir william lucy
lucy thou princely leader of our english strength
 never so needful on the earth of france
 spur to the rescue of the noble talbot
 who now is girdled with a waist of iron
 and hemm'd about with grim destruction
 to bourdeaux warlike duke to bourdeaux york
 else farewell talbot france and england's honour
york o god that somerset who in proud heart
 doth stop my cornets were in talbot's place
 so should we save a valiant gentleman
 by forfeiting a traitor and a coward
 mad ire and wrathful fury makes me weep
 that thus we die while remiss traitors sleep
lucy o send some succor to the distress'd lord
york he dies we lose i break my warlike word
 we mourn france smiles we lose they daily get
 all long of this vile traitor somerset
lucy then god take mercy on brave talbot's soul
 and on his son young john who two hours since
 i met in travel toward his warlike father
 this seven years did not talbot see his son
 and now they meet where both their lives are done
york alas what joy shall noble talbot have
 to bid his young son welcome to his grave
 away vexation almost stops my breath
 that sunder'd friends greet in the hour of death
 lucy farewell no more my fortune can
 but curse the cause i cannot aid the man
 maine blois poictiers and tours are won away
 long all of somerset and his delay
 exit with his soldiers
lucy thus while the vulture of sedition
 feeds in the bosom of such great commanders
 sleeping neglection doth betray to loss
 the conquest of our scarce cold conqueror
 that ever living man of memory
 henry the fifth whiles they each other cross
 lives honours lands and all hurry to loss

scene iv other plains in gascony
 enter somerset with his army a captain of
 talbot's with him
somerset it is too late i cannot send them now
 this expedition was by york and talbot
 too rashly plotted all our general force
 might with a sally of the very town
 be buckled with the overdaring talbot
 hath sullied all his gloss of former honour
 by this unheedful desperate wild adventure
 york set him on to fight and die in shame
 that talbot dead great york might bear the name
captain here is sir william lucy who with me
 set from our o'ermatch'd forces forth for aid
 enter sir william lucy
somerset how now sir william whither were you sent
lucy whither my lord from bought and sold lord talbot
 who ring'd about with bold adversity
 cries out for noble york and somerset
 to beat assailing death from his weak legions
 and whiles the honourable captain there
 drops bloody sweat from his warwearied limbs
 and in advantage lingering looks for rescue
 you his false hopes the trust of england's honour
 keep off aloof with worthless emulation
 let not your private discord keep away
 the levied succors that should lend him aid
 while he renowned noble gentleman
 yields up his life unto a world of odds
 orleans the bastard charles burgundy
 alencon reignier compass him about
 and talbot perisheth by your default
somerset york set him on york should have sent him aid
lucy and york as fast upon your grace exclaims
 swearing that you withhold his levied host
 collected for this expedition
somerset york lies he might have sent and had the horse
 i owe him little duty and less love
 and take foul scorn to fawn on him by sending
lucy the fraud of england not the force of france
 hath now entrapp'd the nobleminded talbot
 never to england shall he bear his life
 but dies betray'd to fortune by your strife
somerset come go i will dispatch the horsemen straight
 within six hours they will be at his aid
lucy too late comes rescue he is ta'en or slain
 for fly he could not if he would have fled
 and fly would talbot never though he might
somerset if he be dead brave talbot then adieu
lucy his fame lives in the world his shame in you

scene v the english camp near bourdeaux
 enter talbot and john his son
talbot o young john talbot i did send for thee
 to tutor thee in stratagems of war
 that talbot's name might be in thee revived
 when sapless age and weak unable limbs
 should bring thy father to his drooping chair
 but o malignant and illboding stars
 now thou art come unto a feast of death
 a terrible and unavoided danger
 therefore dear boy mount on my swiftest horse
 and i'll direct thee how thou shalt escape
 by sudden flight come dally not be gone
john talbot is my name talbot and am i your son
 and shall i fly o if you love my mother
 dishonour not her honourable name
 to make a bastard and a slave of me
 the world will say he is not talbot's blood
 that basely fled when noble talbot stood
talbot fly to revenge my death if i be slain
john talbot he that flies so will ne'er return again
talbot if we both stay we both are sure to die
john talbot then let me stay and father do you fly
 your loss is great so your regard should be
 my worth unknown no loss is known in me
 upon my death the french can little boast
 in yours they will in you all hopes are lost
 flight cannot stain the honour you have won
 but mine it will that no exploit have done
 you fled for vantage everyone will swear
 but if i bow they'll say it was for fear
 there is no hope that ever i will stay
 if the first hour i shrink and run away
 here on my knee i beg mortality
 rather than life preserved with infamy
talbot shall all thy mother's hopes lie in one tomb
john talbot ay rather than i'll shame my mother's womb
talbot upon my blessing i command thee go
john talbot to fight i will but not to fly the foe
talbot part of thy father may be saved in thee
john talbot no part of him but will be shame in me
talbot thou never hadst renown nor canst not lose it
john talbot yes your renowned name shall flight abuse it
talbot thy father's charge shall clear thee from that stain
john talbot you cannot witness for me being slain
 if death be so apparent then both fly
talbot and leave my followers here to fight and die
 my age was never tainted with such shame
john talbot and shall my youth be guilty of such blame
 no more can i be sever'd from your side
 than can yourself yourself in twain divide
 stay go do what you will the like do i
 for live i will not if my father die
talbot then here i take my leave of thee fair son
 born to eclipse thy life this afternoon
 come side by side together live and die
 and soul with soul from france to heaven fly

scene vi a field of battle
 alarum excursions wherein john talbot is
 hemmed about and talbot rescues him
talbot saint george and victory fight soldiers fight
 the regent hath with talbot broke his word
 and left us to the rage of france his sword
 where is john talbot pause and take thy breath
 i gave thee life and rescued thee from death
john talbot o twice my father twice am i thy son
 the life thou gavest me first was lost and done
 till with thy warlike sword despite of late
 to my determined time thou gavest new date
talbot when from the dauphin's crest thy sword struck fire
 it warm'd thy father's heart with proud desire
 of boldfaced victory then leaden age
 quicken'd with youthful spleen and warlike rage
 beat down alencon orleans burgundy
 and from the pride of gallia rescued thee
 the ireful bastard orleans that drew blood
 from thee my boy and had the maidenhood
 of thy first fight i soon encountered
 and interchanging blows i quickly shed
 some of his bastard blood and in disgrace
 bespoke him thus contaminated base
 and misbegotten blood i spill of thine
 mean and right poor for that pure blood of mine
 which thou didst force from talbot my brave boy'
 here purposing the bastard to destroy
 came in strong rescue speak thy father's care
 art thou not weary john how dost thou fare
 wilt thou yet leave the battle boy and fly
 now thou art seal'd the son of chivalry
 fly to revenge my death when i am dead
 the help of one stands me in little stead
 o too much folly is it well i wot
