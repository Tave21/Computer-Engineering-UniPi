act iv
scene iii the same street before pandarus house
 enter paris troilus aeneas deiphobus antenor
 and diomedes
paris it is great morning and the hour prefix'd
 of her delivery to this valiant greek
 comes fast upon good my brother troilus
 tell you the lady what she is to do
 and haste her to the purpose
troilus walk into her house
 i'll bring her to the grecian presently
 and to his hand when i deliver her
 think it an altar and thy brother troilus
 a priest there offering to it his own heart
 exit
paris i know what tis to love
 and would as i shall pity i could help
 please you walk in my lords
 exeunt
 troilus and cressida
act iv
scene iv the same pandarus house
 enter pandarus and cressida
pandarus be moderate be moderate
cressida why tell you me of moderation
 the grief is fine full perfect that i taste
 and violenteth in a sense as strong
 as that which causeth it how can i moderate it
 if i could temporize with my affection
 or brew it to a weak and colder palate
 the like allayment could i give my grief
 my love admits no qualifying dross
 no more my grief in such a precious loss
pandarus here here here he comes
 enter troilus
 ah sweet ducks
cressida o troilus troilus
 embracing him
pandarus what a pair of spectacles is here
 let me embrace too o heart as the goodly saying is
 o heart heavy heart
 why sigh'st thou without breaking
 where he answers again
 because thou canst not ease thy smart
 by friendship nor by speaking'
 there was never a truer rhyme let us cast away
 nothing for we may live to have need of such a
 verse we see it we see it how now lambs
troilus cressid i love thee in so strain'd a purity
 that the bless'd gods as angry with my fancy
 more bright in zeal than the devotion which
 cold lips blow to their deities take thee from me
cressida have the gods envy
pandarus ay ay ay ay tis too plain a case
cressida and is it true that i must go from troy
troilus a hateful truth
cressida what and from troilus too
troilus from troy and troilus
cressida is it possible
troilus and suddenly where injury of chance
 puts back leavetaking justles roughly by
 all time of pause rudely beguiles our lips
 of all rejoindure forcibly prevents
 our lock'd embrasures strangles our dear vows
 even in the birth of our own labouring breath
 we two that with so many thousand sighs
 did buy each other must poorly sell ourselves
 with the rude brevity and discharge of one
 injurious time now with a robber's haste
 crams his rich thievery up he knows not how
 as many farewells as be stars in heaven
 with distinct breath and consign'd kisses to them
 he fumbles up into a lose adieu
 and scants us with a single famish'd kiss
 distasted with the salt of broken tears
aeneas within my lord is the lady ready
troilus hark you are call'd some say the genius so
 cries come to him that instantly must die
 bid them have patience she shall come anon
pandarus where are my tears rain to lay this wind or
 my heart will be blown up by the root
 exit
cressida i must then to the grecians
troilus no remedy
cressida a woful cressid mongst the merry greeks
 when shall we see again
troilus hear me my love be thou but true of heart
cressida i true how now what wicked deem is this
troilus nay we must use expostulation kindly
 for it is parting from us
 i speak not be thou true as fearing thee
 for i will throw my glove to death himself
 that there's no maculation in thy heart
 but be thou true say i to fashion in
