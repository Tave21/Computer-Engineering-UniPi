 whose double bosoms seem to wear one heart
 whose house whose bed whose meal and exercise
 are still together who twin as twere in love
 unseparable shall within this hour
 on a dissension of a doit break out
 to bitterest enmity so fellest foes
 whose passions and whose plots have broke their sleep
 to take the one the other by some chance
 some trick not worth an egg shall grow dear friends
 and interjoin their issues so with me
 my birthplace hate i and my love's upon
 this enemy town i'll enter if he slay me
 he does fair justice if he give me way
 i'll do his country service

aufidius whence comest thou what wouldst thou thy name
 why speak'st not speak man what's thy name
coriolanus if tullus
 unmuffling
 not yet thou knowest me and seeing me dost not
 think me for the man i am necessity
 commands me name myself
aufidius what is thy name
coriolanus a name unmusical to the volscians ears
 and harsh in sound to thine
aufidius say what's thy name
 thou hast a grim appearance and thy face
 bears a command in't though thy tackle's torn
 thou show'st a noble vessel what's thy name
coriolanus prepare thy brow to frown know'st
 thou me yet
aufidius i know thee not thy name
coriolanus my name is caius marcius who hath done
 to thee particularly and to all the volsces
 great hurt and mischief thereto witness may
 my surname coriolanus the painful service
 the extreme dangers and the drops of blood
 shed for my thankless country are requited
 but with that surname a good memory
 and witness of the malice and displeasure
 which thou shouldst bear me only that name remains
 the cruelty and envy of the people
 permitted by our dastard nobles who
 have all forsook me hath devour'd the rest
 and suffer'd me by the voice of slaves to be
 whoop'd out of rome now this extremity
 hath brought me to thy hearth not out of hope
 mistake me notto save my life for if
 i had fear'd death of all the men i the world
 i would have voided thee but in mere spite
 to be full quit of those my banishers
 stand i before thee here then if thou hast
 a heart of wreak in thee that wilt revenge
 thine own particular wrongs and stop those maims
 of shame seen through thy country speed
 thee straight
 and make my misery serve thy turn so use it
 that my revengeful services may prove
 as benefits to thee for i will fight
 against my canker'd country with the spleen
 of all the under fiends but if so be
 thou darest not this and that to prove more fortunes
 thou'rt tired then in a word i also am
 longer to live most weary and present
 my throat to thee and to thy ancient malice
 which not to cut would show thee but a fool
 since i have ever follow'd thee with hate
 drawn tuns of blood out of thy country's breast
 and cannot live but to thy shame unless
 it be to do thee service
aufidius o marcius marcius
 each word thou hast spoke hath weeded from my heart
 a root of ancient envy if jupiter
 should from yond cloud speak divine things
 and say tis true i'ld not believe them more
 than thee all noble marcius let me twine
 mine arms about that body where against
 my grained ash an hundred times hath broke
 and scarr'd the moon with splinters here i clip
 the anvil of my sword and do contest
 as hotly and as nobly with thy love
 as ever in ambitious strength i did
 contend against thy valour know thou first
 i loved the maid i married never man
 sigh'd truer breath but that i see thee here
 thou noble thing more dances my rapt heart
 than when i first my wedded mistress saw
 bestride my threshold why thou mars i tell thee
 we have a power on foot and i had purpose
 once more to hew thy target from thy brawn
 or lose mine arm fort thou hast beat me out
 twelve several times and i have nightly since
 dreamt of encounters twixt thyself and me
 we have been down together in my sleep
 unbuckling helms fisting each other's throat
 and waked half dead with nothing worthy marcius
 had we no quarrel else to rome but that
 thou art thence banish'd we would muster all
 from twelve to seventy and pouring war
 into the bowels of ungrateful rome
 like a bold flood o'erbear o come go in
 and take our friendly senators by the hands
 who now are here taking their leaves of me
 who am prepared against your territories
 though not for rome itself
coriolanus you bless me gods
aufidius therefore most absolute sir if thou wilt have
 the leading of thine own revenges take
 the one half of my commission and set down
 as best thou art experienced since thou know'st
 thy country's strength and weaknessthine own ways
 whether to knock against the gates of rome
