cleopatra aside to domitius enobarbus what means this
domitius enobarbus aside to cleopatra tis one of those odd
 tricks which sorrow shoots
 out of the mind
mark antony and thou art honest too
 i wish i could be made so many men
 and all of you clapp'd up together in
 an antony that i might do you service
 so good as you have done
all the gods forbid
mark antony well my good fellows wait on me tonight
 scant not my cups and make as much of me
 as when mine empire was your fellow too
 and suffer'd my command
cleopatra aside to domitius enobarbus what does he mean
domitius enobarbus aside to cleopatra to make his followers weep
mark antony tend me tonight
 may be it is the period of your duty
 haply you shall not see me more or if
 a mangled shadow perchance tomorrow
 you'll serve another master i look on you
 as one that takes his leave mine honest friends
 i turn you not away but like a master
 married to your good service stay till death
 tend me tonight two hours i ask no more
 and the gods yield you for't
domitius enobarbus what mean you sir
 to give them this discomfort look they weep
 and i an ass am onioneyed for shame
 transform us not to women
mark antony ho ho ho
 now the witch take me if i meant it thus
 grace grow where those drops fall
 my hearty friends
 you take me in too dolorous a sense
 for i spake to you for your comfort did desire you
 to burn this night with torches know my hearts
 i hope well of tomorrow and will lead you
 where rather i'll expect victorious life
 than death and honour let's to supper come
 and drown consideration
