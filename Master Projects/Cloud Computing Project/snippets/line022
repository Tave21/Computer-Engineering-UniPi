and the ass saw the angel of the lord standing in the way and his sword drawn in his hand and the ass turned aside out of the way and went into the field and balaam smote the ass to turn her into the way
but the angel of the lord stood in a path of the vineyards a wall being on this side and a wall on that side
and when the ass saw the angel of the lord she thrust herself unto the wall and crushed balaam's foot against the wall and he smote her again
and the angel of the lord went further and stood in a narrow place where was no way to turn either to the right hand or to the left
and when the ass saw the angel of the lord she fell down under balaam and balaam's anger was kindled and he smote the ass with a staff
and the lord opened the mouth of the ass and she said unto balaam what have i done unto thee that thou hast smitten me these three times
and balaam said unto the ass because thou hast mocked me i would there were a sword in mine hand for now would i kill thee
and the ass said unto balaam am not i thine ass upon which thou hast ridden ever since i was thine unto this day was i ever wont to do so unto thee and he said nay
then the lord opened the eyes of balaam and he saw the angel of the lord standing in the way and his sword drawn in his hand and he bowed down his head and fell flat on his face
and the angel of the lord said unto him wherefore hast thou smitten thine ass these three times behold i went out to withstand thee because thy way is perverse before me
and the ass saw me and turned from me these three times unless she had turned from me surely now also i had slain thee and saved her alive
and balaam said unto the angel of the lord i have sinned for i knew not that thou stoodest in the way against me now therefore if it displease thee i will get me back again
and the angel of the lord said unto balaam go with the men but only the word that i shall speak unto thee that thou shalt speak so balaam went with the princes of balak
and when balak heard that balaam was come he went out to meet him unto a city of moab which is in the border of arnon which is in the utmost coast
and balak said unto balaam did i not earnestly send unto thee to call thee wherefore camest thou not unto me am i not able indeed to promote thee to honour
and balaam said unto balak lo i am come unto thee have i now any power at all to say any thing the word that god putteth in my mouth that shall i speak
and balaam went with balak and they came unto kirjathhuzoth
and balak offered oxen and sheep and sent to balaam and to the princes that were with him
and it came to pass on the morrow that balak took balaam and brought him up into the high places of baal that thence he might see the utmost part of the people
and balaam said unto balak build me here seven altars and prepare me here seven oxen and seven rams
and balak did as balaam had spoken and balak and balaam offered on every altar a bullock and a ram
and balaam said unto balak stand by thy burnt offering and i will go peradventure the lord will come to meet me and whatsoever he sheweth me i will tell thee and he went to an high place
and god met balaam and he said unto him i have prepared seven altars and i have offered upon every altar a bullock and a ram
and the lord put a word in balaam's mouth and said return unto balak and thus thou shalt speak
and he returned unto him and lo he stood by his burnt sacrifice he and all the princes of moab
and he took up his parable and said balak the king of moab hath brought me from aram out of the mountains of the east saying come curse me jacob and come defy israel
how shall i curse whom god hath not cursed or how shall i defy whom the lord hath not defied
for from the top of the rocks i see him and from the hills i behold him lo the people shall dwell alone and shall not be reckoned among the nations
who can count the dust of jacob and the number of the fourth part of israel let me die the death of the righteous and let my last end be like his
and balak said unto balaam what hast thou done unto me i took thee to curse mine enemies and behold thou hast blessed them altogether
and he answered and said must i not take heed to speak that which the lord hath put in my mouth
and balak said unto him come i pray thee with me unto another place from whence thou mayest see them thou shalt see but the utmost part of them and shalt not see them all and curse me them from thence
and he brought him into the field of zophim to the top of pisgah and built seven altars and offered a bullock and a ram on every altar
and he said unto balak stand here by thy burnt offering while i meet the lord yonder
and the lord met balaam and put a word in his mouth and said go again unto balak and say thus
and when he came to him behold he stood by his burnt offering and the princes of moab with him and balak said unto him what hath the lord spoken
and he took up his parable and said rise up balak and hear hearken unto me thou son of zippor
god is not a man that he should lie neither the son of man that he should repent hath he said and shall he not do it or hath he spoken and shall he not make it good
behold i have received commandment to bless and he hath blessed and i cannot reverse it
he hath not beheld iniquity in jacob neither hath he seen perverseness in israel the lord his god is with him and the shout of a king is among them
god brought them out of egypt he hath as it were the strength of an unicorn
surely there is no enchantment against jacob neither is there any divination against israel according to this time it shall be said of jacob and of israel what hath god wrought
behold the people shall rise up as a great lion and lift up himself as a young lion he shall not lie down until he eat of the prey and drink the blood of the slain
and balak said unto balaam neither curse them at all nor bless them at all
but balaam answered and said unto balak told not i thee saying all that the lord speaketh that i must do
and balak said unto balaam come i pray thee i will bring thee unto another place peradventure it will please god that thou mayest curse me them from thence
and balak brought balaam unto the top of peor that looketh toward jeshimon
and balaam said unto balak build me here seven altars and prepare me here seven bullocks and seven rams
and balak did as balaam had said and offered a bullock and a ram on every altar
and when balaam saw that it pleased the lord to bless israel he went not as at other times to seek for enchantments but he set his face toward the wilderness
and balaam lifted up his eyes and he saw israel abiding in his tents according to their tribes and the spirit of god came upon him
and he took up his parable and said balaam the son of beor hath said and the man whose eyes are open hath said
he hath said which heard the words of god which saw the vision of the almighty falling into a trance but having his eyes open
how goodly are thy tents o jacob and thy tabernacles o israel
as the valleys are they spread forth as gardens by the river's side as the trees of lign aloes which the lord hath planted and as cedar trees beside the waters
he shall pour the water out of his buckets and his seed shall be in many waters and his king shall be higher than agag and his kingdom shall be exalted
god brought him forth out of egypt he hath as it were the strength of an unicorn he shall eat up the nations his enemies and shall break their bones and pierce them through with his arrows
he couched he lay down as a lion and as a great lion who shall stir him up blessed is he that blesseth thee and cursed is he that curseth thee
and balak's anger was kindled against balaam and he smote his hands together and balak said unto balaam i called thee to curse mine enemies and behold thou hast altogether blessed them these three times
therefore now flee thou to thy place i thought to promote thee unto great honour but lo the lord hath kept thee back from honour
and balaam said unto balak spake i not also to thy messengers which thou sentest unto me saying
if balak would give me his house full of silver and gold i cannot go beyond the commandment of the lord to do either good or bad of mine own mind but what the lord saith that will i speak
and now behold i go unto my people come therefore and i will advertise thee what this people shall do to thy people in the latter days
and he took up his parable and said balaam the son of beor hath said and the man whose eyes are open hath said
he hath said which heard the words of god and knew the knowledge of the most high which saw the vision of the almighty falling into a trance but having his eyes open
i shall see him but not now i shall behold him but not nigh there shall come a star out of jacob and a sceptre shall rise out of israel and shall smite the corners of moab and destroy all the children of sheth
and edom shall be a possession seir also shall be a possession for his enemies and israel shall do valiantly
out of jacob shall come he that shall have dominion and shall destroy him that remaineth of the city
and when he looked on amalek he took up his parable and said amalek was the first of the nations but his latter end shall be that he perish for ever
and he looked on the kenites and took up his parable and said strong is thy dwellingplace and thou puttest thy nest in a rock
nevertheless the kenite shall be wasted until asshur shall carry thee away captive
and he took up his parable and said alas who shall live when god doeth this
and ships shall come from the coast of chittim and shall afflict asshur and shall afflict eber and he also shall perish for ever
and balaam rose up and went and returned to his place and balak also went his way
and israel abode in shittim and the people began to commit whoredom with the daughters of moab
and they called the people unto the sacrifices of their gods and the people did eat and bowed down to their gods
and israel joined himself unto baalpeor and the anger of the lord was kindled against israel
and the lord said unto moses take all the heads of the people and hang them up before the lord against the sun that the fierce anger of the lord may be turned away from israel
and moses said unto the judges of israel slay ye every one his men that were joined unto baalpeor
and behold one of the children of israel came and brought unto his brethren a midianitish woman in the sight of moses and in the sight of all the congregation of the children of israel who were weeping before the door of the tabernacle of the congregation
and when phinehas the son of eleazar the son of aaron the priest saw it he rose up from among the congregation and took a javelin in his hand
and he went after the man of israel into the tent and thrust both of them through the man of israel and the woman through her belly so the plague was stayed from the children of israel
and those that died in the plague were twenty and four thousand
and the lord spake unto moses saying
phinehas the son of eleazar the son of aaron the priest hath turned my wrath away from the children of israel while he was zealous for my sake among them that i consumed not the children of israel in my jealousy
wherefore say behold i give unto him my covenant of peace
and he shall have it and his seed after him even the covenant of an everlasting priesthood because he was zealous for his god and made an atonement for the children of israel
now the name of the israelite that was slain even that was slain with the midianitish woman was zimri the son of salu a prince of a chief house among the simeonites
and the name of the midianitish woman that was slain was cozbi the daughter of zur he was head over a people and of a chief house in midian
and the lord spake unto moses saying
vex the midianites and smite them
for they vex you with their wiles wherewith they have beguiled you in the matter of peor and in the matter of cozbi the daughter of a prince of midian their sister which was slain in the day of the plague for peor's sake
and it came to pass after the plague that the lord spake unto moses and unto eleazar the son of aaron the priest saying

but among these there was not a man of them whom moses and aaron the priest numbered when they numbered the children of israel in the wilderness of sinai

and thou shalt speak unto the children of israel saying if a man die and have no son then ye shall cause his inheritance to pass unto his daughter
and if he have no daughter then ye shall give his inheritance unto his brethren
and if he have no brethren then ye shall give his inheritance unto his father's brethren
