king john come hither hubert o my gentle hubert
 we owe thee much within this wall of flesh
 there is a soul counts thee her creditor
 and with advantage means to pay thy love
 and my good friend thy voluntary oath
 lives in this bosom dearly cherished
 give me thy hand i had a thing to say
 but i will fit it with some better time
 by heaven hubert i am almost ashamed
 to say what good respect i have of thee
hubert i am much bounden to your majesty
king john good friend thou hast no cause to say so yet
 but thou shalt have and creep time ne'er so slow
 yet it shall come from me to do thee good
 i had a thing to say but let it go
 the sun is in the heaven and the proud day
 attended with the pleasures of the world
 is all too wanton and too full of gawds
 to give me audience if the midnight bell
 did with his iron tongue and brazen mouth
 sound on into the drowsy race of night
 if this same were a churchyard where we stand
 and thou possessed with a thousand wrongs
 or if that surly spirit melancholy
 had baked thy blood and made it heavythick
 which else runs tickling up and down the veins
 making that idiot laughter keep men's eyes
 and strain their cheeks to idle merriment
 a passion hateful to my purposes
 or if that thou couldst see me without eyes
 hear me without thine ears and make reply
 without a tongue using conceit alone
 without eyes ears and harmful sound of words
 then in despite of brooded watchful day
 i would into thy bosom pour my thoughts
 but ah i will not yet i love thee well
 and by my troth i think thou lovest me well
hubert so well that what you bid me undertake
 though that my death were adjunct to my act
 by heaven i would do it
king john do not i know thou wouldst
 good hubert hubert hubert throw thine eye
 on yon young boy i'll tell thee what my friend
 he is a very serpent in my way
 and whereso'er this foot of mine doth tread
 he lies before me dost thou understand me
 thou art his keeper
hubert and i'll keep him so
 that he shall not offend your majesty
king john death
hubert my lord
king john a grave
hubert he shall not live
king john enough
 i could be merry now hubert i love thee
 well i'll not say what i intend for thee
 remember madam fare you well
 i'll send those powers o'er to your majesty
elinor my blessing go with thee
king john for england cousin go
 hubert shall be your man attend on you
 with all true duty on toward calais ho
 exeunt
 king john
act iii
scene iv the same king philip's tent
 enter king philip lewis cardinal pandulph
 and attendants
king philip so by a roaring tempest on the flood
 a whole armado of convicted sail
 is scatter'd and disjoin'd from fellowship
cardinal pandulph courage and comfort all shall yet go well
king philip what can go well when we have run so ill
 are we not beaten is not angiers lost
 arthur ta'en prisoner divers dear friends slain
 and bloody england into england gone
 o'erbearing interruption spite of france
lewis what he hath won that hath he fortified
 so hot a speed with such advice disposed
 such temperate order in so fierce a cause
 doth want example who hath read or heard
 of any kindred action like to this
king philip well could i bear that england had this praise
 so we could find some pattern of our shame
 enter constance
 look who comes here a grave unto a soul
 holding the eternal spirit against her will
 in the vile prison of afflicted breath
 i prithee lady go away with me
constance lo now i now see the issue of your peace
king philip patience good lady comfort gentle constance
constance no i defy all counsel all redress
 but that which ends all counsel true redress
 death death o amiable lovely death
 thou odouriferous stench sound rottenness
 arise forth from the couch of lasting night
 thou hate and terror to prosperity
 and i will kiss thy detestable bones
 and put my eyeballs in thy vaulty brows
 and ring these fingers with thy household worms
 and stop this gap of breath with fulsome dust
 and be a carrion monster like thyself
 come grin on me and i will think thou smilest
 and buss thee as thy wife misery's love
 o come to me
king philip o fair affliction peace
constance no no i will not having breath to cry
 o that my tongue were in the thunder's mouth
 then with a passion would i shake the world
 and rouse from sleep that fell anatomy
 which cannot hear a lady's feeble voice
 which scorns a modern invocation
cardinal pandulph lady you utter madness and not sorrow
constance thou art not holy to belie me so
 i am not mad this hair i tear is mine
 my name is constance i was geffrey's wife
 young arthur is my son and he is lost
 i am not mad i would to heaven i were
 for then tis like i should forget myself
 o if i could what grief should i forget
 preach some philosophy to make me mad
 and thou shalt be canonized cardinal
 for being not mad but sensible of grief
 my reasonable part produces reason
 how i may be deliver'd of these woes
 and teaches me to kill or hang myself
 if i were mad i should forget my son
 or madly think a babe of clouts were he
 i am not mad too well too well i feel
 the different plague of each calamity
king philip bind up those tresses o what love i note
 in the fair multitude of those her hairs
 where but by chance a silver drop hath fallen
 even to that drop ten thousand wiry friends
 do glue themselves in sociable grief
 like true inseparable faithful loves
 sticking together in calamity
constance to england if you will
king philip bind up your hairs
constance yes that i will and wherefore will i do it
 i tore them from their bonds and cried aloud
 o that these hands could so redeem my son
 as they have given these hairs their liberty'
 but now i envy at their liberty
 and will again commit them to their bonds
 because my poor child is a prisoner
 and father cardinal i have heard you say
 that we shall see and know our friends in heaven
 if that be true i shall see my boy again
 for since the birth of cain the first male child
 to him that did but yesterday suspire
 there was not such a gracious creature born
 but now will cankersorrow eat my bud
 and chase the native beauty from his cheek
 and he will look as hollow as a ghost
 as dim and meagre as an ague's fit
 and so he'll die and rising so again
 when i shall meet him in the court of heaven
 i shall not know him therefore never never
 must i behold my pretty arthur more
cardinal pandulph you hold too heinous a respect of grief
constance he talks to me that never had a son
king philip you are as fond of grief as of your child
constance grief fills the room up of my absent child
 lies in his bed walks up and down with me
 puts on his pretty looks repeats his words
 remembers me of all his gracious parts
 stuffs out his vacant garments with his form
 then have i reason to be fond of grief
 fare you well had you such a loss as i
 i could give better comfort than you do
 i will not keep this form upon my head
 when there is such disorder in my wit
 o lord my boy my arthur my fair son
 my life my joy my food my all the world
 my widowcomfort and my sorrows cure
 exit
king philip i fear some outrage and i'll follow her
 exit
lewis there's nothing in this world can make me joy
 life is as tedious as a twicetold tale
 vexing the dull ear of a drowsy man
 and bitter shame hath spoil'd the sweet world's taste
 that it yields nought but shame and bitterness
cardinal pandulph before the curing of a strong disease
 even in the instant of repair and health
 the fit is strongest evils that take leave
 on their departure most of all show evil
 what have you lost by losing of this day
lewis all days of glory joy and happiness
cardinal pandulph if you had won it certainly you had
 no no when fortune means to men most good
 she looks upon them with a threatening eye
 tis strange to think how much king john hath lost
 in this which he accounts so clearly won
 are not you grieved that arthur is his prisoner
lewis as heartily as he is glad he hath him
cardinal pandulph your mind is all as youthful as your blood
 now hear me speak with a prophetic spirit
 for even the breath of what i mean to speak
