 but never hope to know why i should marry her
king thou know'st she has raised me from my sickly bed
bertram but follows it my lord to bring me down
 must answer for your raising i know her well
 she had her breeding at my father's charge
 a poor physician's daughter my wife disdain
 rather corrupt me ever
king tis only title thou disdain'st in her the which
 i can build up strange is it that our bloods
 of colour weight and heat pour'd all together
 would quite confound distinction yet stand off
 in differences so mighty if she be
 all that is virtuous save what thou dislikest
 a poor physician's daughter thou dislikest
 of virtue for the name but do not so
 from lowest place when virtuous things proceed
 the place is dignified by the doer's deed
 where great additions swell's and virtue none
 it is a dropsied honour good alone
 is good without a name vileness is so
 the property by what it is should go
 not by the title she is young wise fair
 in these to nature she's immediate heir
 and these breed honour that is honour's scorn
 which challenges itself as honour's born
 and is not like the sire honours thrive
 when rather from our acts we them derive
 than our foregoers the mere word's a slave
 debosh'd on every tomb on every grave
 a lying trophy and as oft is dumb
 where dust and damn'd oblivion is the tomb
 of honour'd bones indeed what should be said
 if thou canst like this creature as a maid
 i can create the rest virtue and she
 is her own dower honour and wealth from me
bertram i cannot love her nor will strive to do't
king thou wrong'st thyself if thou shouldst strive to choose
helena that you are well restored my lord i'm glad
 let the rest go
king my honour's at the stake which to defeat
 i must produce my power here take her hand
 proud scornful boy unworthy this good gift
 that dost in vile misprision shackle up
 my love and her desert that canst not dream
 we poising us in her defective scale
 shall weigh thee to the beam that wilt not know
 it is in us to plant thine honour where
 we please to have it grow cheque thy contempt
 obey our will which travails in thy good
 believe not thy disdain but presently
 do thine own fortunes that obedient right
 which both thy duty owes and our power claims
 or i will throw thee from my care for ever
 into the staggers and the careless lapse
 of youth and ignorance both my revenge and hate
 loosing upon thee in the name of justice
 without all terms of pity speak thine answer
bertram pardon my gracious lord for i submit
 my fancy to your eyes when i consider
 what great creation and what dole of honour
 flies where you bid it i find that she which late
 was in my nobler thoughts most base is now
 the praised of the king who so ennobled
 is as twere born so
king take her by the hand
 and tell her she is thine to whom i promise
 a counterpoise if not to thy estate
 a balance more replete
bertram i take her hand
king good fortune and the favour of the king
 smile upon this contract whose ceremony
 shall seem expedient on the nowborn brief
 and be perform'd tonight the solemn feast
 shall more attend upon the coming space
 expecting absent friends as thou lovest her
 thy love's to me religious else does err
 exeunt all but lafeu and parolles
lafeu advancing do you hear monsieur a word with you
parolles your pleasure sir
lafeu your lord and master did well to make his
 recantation
parolles recantation my lord my master
lafeu ay is it not a language i speak
parolles a most harsh one and not to be understood without
 bloody succeeding my master
lafeu are you companion to the count rousillon
parolles to any count to all counts to what is man
lafeu to what is count's man count's master is of
 another style
parolles you are too old sir let it satisfy you you are too old
lafeu i must tell thee sirrah i write man to which
 title age cannot bring thee
parolles what i dare too well do i dare not do
lafeu i did think thee for two ordinaries to be a pretty
 wise fellow thou didst make tolerable vent of thy
 travel it might pass yet the scarfs and the
 bannerets about thee did manifoldly dissuade me from
 believing thee a vessel of too great a burthen i
 have now found thee when i lose thee again i care
 not yet art thou good for nothing but taking up and
 that thou't scarce worth
parolles hadst thou not the privilege of antiquity upon thee
lafeu do not plunge thyself too far in anger lest thou
 hasten thy trial which iflord have mercy on thee
 for a hen so my good window of lattice fare thee
 well thy casement i need not open for i look
 through thee give me thy hand
parolles my lord you give me most egregious indignity
lafeu ay with all my heart and thou art worthy of it
parolles i have not my lord deserved it
lafeu yes good faith every dram of it and i will not
 bate thee a scruple
parolles well i shall be wiser
lafeu even as soon as thou canst for thou hast to pull at
 a smack o the contrary if ever thou be'st bound
 in thy scarf and beaten thou shalt find what it is
 to be proud of thy bondage i have a desire to hold
 my acquaintance with thee or rather my knowledge
 that i may say in the default he is a man i know
parolles my lord you do me most insupportable vexation
lafeu i would it were hellpains for thy sake and my poor
 doing eternal for doing i am past as i will by
 thee in what motion age will give me leave
 exit
parolles well thou hast a son shall take this disgrace off
 me scurvy old filthy scurvy lord well i must
 be patient there is no fettering of authority
 i'll beat him by my life if i can meet him with
 any convenience an he were double and double a
 lord i'll have no more pity of his age than i
 would ofi'll beat him an if i could but meet him again
 reenter lafeu
lafeu sirrah your lord and master's married there's news
 for you you have a new mistress
parolles i most unfeignedly beseech your lordship to make
 some reservation of your wrongs he is my good
 lord whom i serve above is my master
lafeu who god
parolles ay sir
lafeu the devil it is that's thy master why dost thou
 garter up thy arms o this fashion dost make hose of
 sleeves do other servants so thou wert best set
 thy lower part where thy nose stands by mine
 honour if i were but two hours younger i'ld beat
 thee methinks thou art a general offence and
 every man should beat thee i think thou wast
 created for men to breathe themselves upon thee
parolles this is hard and undeserved measure my lord
lafeu go to sir you were beaten in italy for picking a
 kernel out of a pomegranate you are a vagabond and
 no true traveller you are more saucy with lords
 and honourable personages than the commission of your
 birth and virtue gives you heraldry you are not
 worth another word else i'ld call you knave i leave you
 exit
parolles good very good it is so then good very good
 let it be concealed awhile
 reenter bertram
bertram undone and forfeited to cares for ever
parolles what's the matter sweetheart
bertram although before the solemn priest i have sworn
 i will not bed her
parolles what what sweetheart
bertram o my parolles they have married me
 i'll to the tuscan wars and never bed her
parolles france is a doghole and it no more merits
 the tread of a man's foot to the wars
bertram there's letters from my mother what the import is
 i know not yet
parolles ay that would be known to the wars my boy to the wars
 he wears his honour in a box unseen
 that hugs his kickywicky here at home
 spending his manly marrow in her arms
 which should sustain the bound and high curvet
 of mars's fiery steed to other regions
 france is a stable we that dwell in't jades
 therefore to the war
bertram it shall be so i'll send her to my house
 acquaint my mother with my hate to her
 and wherefore i am fled write to the king
 that which i durst not speak his present gift
 shall furnish me to those italian fields
 where noble fellows strike war is no strife
 to the dark house and the detested wife
parolles will this capriccio hold in thee art sure
bertram go with me to my chamber and advise me
 i'll send her straight away tomorrow
 i'll to the wars she to her single sorrow
parolles why these balls bound there's noise in it tis hard
 a young man married is a man that's marr'd
 therefore away and leave her bravely go
 the king has done you wrong but hush tis so
 exeunt
 all's well that ends well
