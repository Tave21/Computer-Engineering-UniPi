repent therefore of this thy wickedness and pray god if perhaps the thought of thine heart may be forgiven thee
for i perceive that thou art in the gall of bitterness and in the bond of iniquity
then answered simon and said pray ye to the lord for me that none of these things which ye have spoken come upon me
and they when they had testified and preached the word of the lord returned to jerusalem and preached the gospel in many villages of the samaritans
and the angel of the lord spake unto philip saying arise and go toward the south unto the way that goeth down from jerusalem unto gaza which is desert
and he arose and went and behold a man of ethiopia an eunuch of great authority under candace queen of the ethiopians who had the charge of all her treasure and had come to jerusalem for to worship
was returning and sitting in his chariot read esaias the prophet
then the spirit said unto philip go near and join thyself to this chariot
and philip ran thither to him and heard him read the prophet esaias and said understandest thou what thou readest
and he said how can i except some man should guide me and he desired philip that he would come up and sit with him
the place of the scripture which he read was this he was led as a sheep to the slaughter and like a lamb dumb before his shearer so opened he not his mouth
in his humiliation his judgment was taken away and who shall declare his generation for his life is taken from the earth
and the eunuch answered philip and said i pray thee of whom speaketh the prophet this of himself or of some other man
then philip opened his mouth and began at the same scripture and preached unto him jesus
and as they went on their way they came unto a certain water and the eunuch said see here is water what doth hinder me to be baptized
and philip said if thou believest with all thine heart thou mayest and he answered and said i believe that jesus christ is the son of god
and he commanded the chariot to stand still and they went down both into the water both philip and the eunuch and he baptized him
and when they were come up out of the water the spirit of the lord caught away philip that the eunuch saw him no more and he went on his way rejoicing
but philip was found at azotus and passing through he preached in all the cities till he came to caesarea
and saul yet breathing out threatenings and slaughter against the disciples of the lord went unto the high priest
and desired of him letters to damascus to the synagogues that if he found any of this way whether they were men or women he might bring them bound unto jerusalem
and as he journeyed he came near damascus and suddenly there shined round about him a light from heaven
and he fell to the earth and heard a voice saying unto him saul saul why persecutest thou me
and he said who art thou lord and the lord said i am jesus whom thou persecutest it is hard for thee to kick against the pricks
and he trembling and astonished said lord what wilt thou have me to do and the lord said unto him arise and go into the city and it shall be told thee what thou must do
and the men which journeyed with him stood speechless hearing a voice but seeing no man
and saul arose from the earth and when his eyes were opened he saw no man but they led him by the hand and brought him into damascus
and he was three days without sight and neither did eat nor drink
and there was a certain disciple at damascus named ananias and to him said the lord in a vision ananias and he said behold i am here lord
and the lord said unto him arise and go into the street which is called straight and enquire in the house of judas for one called saul of tarsus for behold he prayeth
and hath seen in a vision a man named ananias coming in and putting his hand on him that he might receive his sight
then ananias answered lord i have heard by many of this man how much evil he hath done to thy saints at jerusalem
and here he hath authority from the chief priests to bind all that call on thy name
but the lord said unto him go thy way for he is a chosen vessel unto me to bear my name before the gentiles and kings and the children of israel
for i will shew him how great things he must suffer for my name's sake
and ananias went his way and entered into the house and putting his hands on him said brother saul the lord even jesus that appeared unto thee in the way as thou camest hath sent me that thou mightest receive thy sight and be filled with the holy ghost
and immediately there fell from his eyes as it had been scales and he received sight forthwith and arose and was baptized
and when he had received meat he was strengthened then was saul certain days with the disciples which were at damascus
and straightway he preached christ in the synagogues that he is the son of god
but all that heard him were amazed and said is not this he that destroyed them which called on this name in jerusalem and came hither for that intent that he might bring them bound unto the chief priests
but saul increased the more in strength and confounded the jews which dwelt at damascus proving that this is very christ
and after that many days were fulfilled the jews took counsel to kill him
but their laying await was known of saul and they watched the gates day and night to kill him
then the disciples took him by night and let him down by the wall in a basket
and when saul was come to jerusalem he assayed to join himself to the disciples but they were all afraid of him and believed not that he was a disciple
but barnabas took him and brought him to the apostles and declared unto them how he had seen the lord in the way and that he had spoken to him and how he had preached boldly at damascus in the name of jesus
and he was with them coming in and going out at jerusalem
and he spake boldly in the name of the lord jesus and disputed against the grecians but they went about to slay him
which when the brethren knew they brought him down to caesarea and sent him forth to tarsus
then had the churches rest throughout all judaea and galilee and samaria and were edified and walking in the fear of the lord and in the comfort of the holy ghost were multiplied
and it came to pass as peter passed throughout all quarters he came down also to the saints which dwelt at lydda
and there he found a certain man named aeneas which had kept his bed eight years and was sick of the palsy
and peter said unto him aeneas jesus christ maketh thee whole arise and make thy bed and he arose immediately
and all that dwelt at lydda and saron saw him and turned to the lord
now there was at joppa a certain disciple named tabitha which by interpretation is called dorcas this woman was full of good works and almsdeeds which she did
and it came to pass in those days that she was sick and died whom when they had washed they laid her in an upper chamber
and forasmuch as lydda was nigh to joppa and the disciples had heard that peter was there they sent unto him two men desiring him that he would not delay to come to them
then peter arose and went with them when he was come they brought him into the upper chamber and all the widows stood by him weeping and shewing the coats and garments which dorcas made while she was with them
but peter put them all forth and kneeled down and prayed and turning him to the body said tabitha arise and she opened her eyes and when she saw peter she sat up
and he gave her his hand and lifted her up and when he had called the saints and widows presented her alive
and it was known throughout all joppa and many believed in the lord
and it came to pass that he tarried many days in joppa with one simon a tanner
there was a certain man in caesarea called cornelius a centurion of the band called the italian band
a devout man and one that feared god with all his house which gave much alms to the people and prayed to god alway
he saw in a vision evidently about the ninth hour of the day an angel of god coming in to him and saying unto him cornelius
and when he looked on him he was afraid and said what is it lord and he said unto him thy prayers and thine alms are come up for a memorial before god
and now send men to joppa and call for one simon whose surname is peter
he lodgeth with one simon a tanner whose house is by the sea side he shall tell thee what thou oughtest to do
and when the angel which spake unto cornelius was departed he called two of his household servants and a devout soldier of them that waited on him continually
and when he had declared all these things unto them he sent them to joppa
on the morrow as they went on their journey and drew nigh unto the city peter went up upon the housetop to pray about the sixth hour
and he became very hungry and would have eaten but while they made ready he fell into a trance
and saw heaven opened and a certain vessel descending unto him as it had been a great sheet knit at the four corners and let down to the earth
wherein were all manner of fourfooted beasts of the earth and wild beasts and creeping things and fowls of the air
and there came a voice to him rise peter kill and eat
but peter said not so lord for i have never eaten any thing that is common or unclean
and the voice spake unto him again the second time what god hath cleansed that call not thou common
this was done thrice and the vessel was received up again into heaven
now while peter doubted in himself what this vision which he had seen should mean behold the men which were sent from cornelius had made enquiry for simon's house and stood before the gate
and called and asked whether simon which was surnamed peter were lodged there
while peter thought on the vision the spirit said unto him behold three men seek thee
arise therefore and get thee down and go with them doubting nothing for i have sent them
then peter went down to the men which were sent unto him from cornelius and said behold i am he whom ye seek what is the cause wherefore ye are come
and they said cornelius the centurion a just man and one that feareth god and of good report among all the nation of the jews was warned from god by an holy angel to send for thee into his house and to hear words of thee
then called he them in and lodged them and on the morrow peter went away with them and certain brethren from joppa accompanied him
and the morrow after they entered into caesarea and cornelius waited for them and had called together his kinsmen and near friends
and as peter was coming in cornelius met him and fell down at his feet and worshipped him
but peter took him up saying stand up i myself also am a man
and as he talked with him he went in and found many that were come together
and he said unto them ye know how that it is an unlawful thing for a man that is a jew to keep company or come unto one of another nation but god hath shewed me that i should not call any man common or unclean
therefore came i unto you without gainsaying as soon as i was sent for i ask therefore for what intent ye have sent for me
and cornelius said four days ago i was fasting until this hour and at the ninth hour i prayed in my house and behold a man stood before me in bright clothing
and said cornelius thy prayer is heard and thine alms are had in remembrance in the sight of god
send therefore to joppa and call hither simon whose surname is peter he is lodged in the house of one simon a tanner by the sea side who when he cometh shall speak unto thee
immediately therefore i sent to thee and thou hast well done that thou art come now therefore are we all here present before god to hear all things that are commanded thee of god
then peter opened his mouth and said of a truth i perceive that god is no respecter of persons
but in every nation he that feareth him and worketh righteousness is accepted with him
the word which god sent unto the children of israel preaching peace by jesus christ he is lord of all
that word i say ye know which was published throughout all judaea and began from galilee after the baptism which john preached
how god anointed jesus of nazareth with the holy ghost and with power who went about doing good and healing all that were oppressed of the devil for god was with him
and we are witnesses of all things which he did both in the land of the jews and in jerusalem whom they slew and hanged on a tree
him god raised up the third day and shewed him openly
not to all the people but unto witnesses chosen before of god even to us who did eat and drink with him after he rose from the dead
and he commanded us to preach unto the people and to testify that it is he which was ordained of god to be the judge of quick and dead
to him give all the prophets witness that through his name whosoever believeth in him shall receive remission of sins
while peter yet spake these words the holy ghost fell on all them which heard the word
and they of the circumcision which believed were astonished as many as came with peter because that on the gentiles also was poured out the gift of the holy ghost
for they heard them speak with tongues and magnify god then answered peter
can any man forbid water that these should not be baptized which have received the holy ghost as well as we
and he commanded them to be baptized in the name of the lord then prayed they him to tarry certain days
and the apostles and brethren that were in judaea heard that the gentiles had also received the word of god
and when peter was come up to jerusalem they that were of the circumcision contended with him
saying thou wentest in to men uncircumcised and didst eat with them
but peter rehearsed the matter from the beginning and expounded it by order unto them saying
i was in the city of joppa praying and in a trance i saw a vision a certain vessel descend as it had been a great sheet let down from heaven by four corners and it came even to me
upon the which when i had fastened mine eyes i considered and saw fourfooted beasts of the earth and wild beasts and creeping things and fowls of the air
and i heard a voice saying unto me arise peter slay and eat
but i said not so lord for nothing common or unclean hath at any time entered into my mouth
but the voice answered me again from heaven what god hath cleansed that call not thou common
and this was done three times and all were drawn up again into heaven
and behold immediately there were three men already come unto the house where i was sent from caesarea unto me
and the spirit bade me go with them nothing doubting moreover these six brethren accompanied me and we entered into the man's house
and he shewed us how he had seen an angel in his house which stood and said unto him send men to joppa and call for simon whose surname is peter
who shall tell thee words whereby thou and all thy house shall be saved
and as i began to speak the holy ghost fell on them as on us at the beginning
then remembered i the word of the lord how that he said john indeed baptized with water but ye shall be baptized with the holy ghost
forasmuch then as god gave them the like gift as he did unto us who believed on the lord jesus christ what was i that i could withstand god
when they heard these things they held their peace and glorified god saying then hath god also to the gentiles granted repentance unto life
now they which were scattered abroad upon the persecution that arose about stephen travelled as far as phenice and cyprus and antioch preaching the word to none but unto the jews only
and some of them were men of cyprus and cyrene which when they were come to antioch spake unto the grecians preaching the lord jesus
and the hand of the lord was with them and a great number believed and turned unto the lord
then tidings of these things came unto the ears of the church which was in jerusalem and they sent forth barnabas that he should go as far as antioch
who when he came and had seen the grace of god was glad and exhorted them all that with purpose of heart they would cleave unto the lord
for he was a good man and full of the holy ghost and of faith and much people was added unto the lord
then departed barnabas to tarsus for to seek saul
and when he had found him he brought him unto antioch and it came to pass that a whole year they assembled themselves with the church and taught much people and the disciples were called christians first in antioch
and in these days came prophets from jerusalem unto antioch
and there stood up one of them named agabus and signified by the spirit that there should be great dearth throughout all the world which came to pass in the days of claudius caesar
then the disciples every man according to his ability determined to send relief unto the brethren which dwelt in judaea
which also they did and sent it to the elders by the hands of barnabas and saul
now about that time herod the king stretched forth his hands to vex certain of the church
and he killed james the brother of john with the sword
and because he saw it pleased the jews he proceeded further to take peter also then were the days of unleavened bread
and when he had apprehended him he put him in prison and delivered him to four quaternions of soldiers to keep him intending after easter to bring him forth to the people
peter therefore was kept in prison but prayer was made without ceasing of the church unto god for him
and when herod would have brought him forth the same night peter was sleeping between two soldiers bound with two chains and the keepers before the door kept the prison
and behold the angel of the lord came upon him and a light shined in the prison and he smote peter on the side and raised him up saying arise up quickly and his chains fell off from his hands
and the angel said unto him gird thyself and bind on thy sandals and so he did and he saith unto him cast thy garment about thee and follow me
and he went out and followed him and wist not that it was true which was done by the angel but thought he saw a vision
when they were past the first and the second ward they came unto the iron gate that leadeth unto the city which opened to them of his own accord and they went out and passed on through one street and forthwith the angel departed from him
and when peter was come to himself he said now i know of a surety that the lord hath sent his angel and hath delivered me out of the hand of herod and from all the expectation of the people of the jews
and when he had considered the thing he came to the house of mary the mother of john whose surname was mark where many were gathered together praying
and as peter knocked at the door of the gate a damsel came to hearken named rhoda
and when she knew peter's voice she opened not the gate for gladness but ran in and told how peter stood before the gate
and they said unto her thou art mad but she constantly affirmed that it was even so then said they it is his angel
but peter continued knocking and when they had opened the door and saw him they were astonished
but he beckoning unto them with the hand to hold their peace declared unto them how the lord had brought him out of the prison and he said go shew these things unto james and to the brethren and he departed and went into another place
now as soon as it was day there was no small stir among the soldiers what was become of peter
and when herod had sought for him and found him not he examined the keepers and commanded that they should be put to death and he went down from judaea to caesarea and there abode
and herod was highly displeased with them of tyre and sidon but they came with one accord to him and having made blastus the king's chamberlain their friend desired peace because their country was nourished by the king's country
and upon a set day herod arrayed in royal apparel sat upon his throne and made an oration unto them
and the people gave a shout saying it is the voice of a god and not of a man
and immediately the angel of the lord smote him because he gave not god the glory and he was eaten of worms and gave up the ghost
but the word of god grew and multiplied
and barnabas and saul returned from jerusalem when they had fulfilled their ministry and took with them john whose surname was mark
now there were in the church that was at antioch certain prophets and teachers as barnabas and simeon that was called niger and lucius of cyrene and manaen which had been brought up with herod the tetrarch and saul
as they ministered to the lord and fasted the holy ghost said separate me barnabas and saul for the work whereunto i have called them
and when they had fasted and prayed and laid their hands on them they sent them away
so they being sent forth by the holy ghost departed unto seleucia and from thence they sailed to cyprus
and when they were at salamis they preached the word of god in the synagogues of the jews and they had also john to their minister
and when they had gone through the isle unto paphos they found a certain sorcerer a false prophet a jew whose name was barjesus
which was with the deputy of the country sergius paulus a prudent man who called for barnabas and saul and desired to hear the word of god
but elymas the sorcerer for so is his name by interpretation withstood them seeking to turn away the deputy from the faith
then saul who also is called paul filled with the holy ghost set his eyes on him
and said o full of all subtilty and all mischief thou child of the devil thou enemy of all righteousness wilt thou not cease to pervert the right ways of the lord
and now behold the hand of the lord is upon thee and thou shalt be blind not seeing the sun for a season and immediately there fell on him a mist and a darkness and he went about seeking some to lead him by the hand
then the deputy when he saw what was done believed being astonished at the doctrine of the lord
now when paul and his company loosed from paphos they came to perga in pamphylia and john departing from them returned to jerusalem
but when they departed from perga they came to antioch in pisidia and went into the synagogue on the sabbath day and sat down
and after the reading of the law and the prophets the rulers of the synagogue sent unto them saying ye men and brethren if ye have any word of exhortation for the people say on
then paul stood up and beckoning with his hand said men of israel and ye that fear god give audience
the god of this people of israel chose our fathers and exalted the people when they dwelt as strangers in the land of egypt and with an high arm brought he them out of it
and about the time of forty years suffered he their manners in the wilderness
and when he had destroyed seven nations in the land of chanaan he divided their land to them by lot
and after that he gave unto them judges about the space of four hundred and fifty years until samuel the prophet
and afterward they desired a king and god gave unto them saul the son of cis a man of the tribe of benjamin by the space of forty years
and when he had removed him he raised up unto them david to be their king to whom also he gave testimony and said i have found david the son of jesse a man after mine own heart which shall fulfil all my will
of this man's seed hath god according to his promise raised unto israel a saviour jesus
when john had first preached before his coming the baptism of repentance to all the people of israel
and as john fulfilled his course he said whom think ye that i am i am not he but behold there cometh one after me whose shoes of his feet i am not worthy to loose
men and brethren children of the stock of abraham and whosoever among you feareth god to you is the word of this salvation sent
for they that dwell at jerusalem and their rulers because they knew him not nor yet the voices of the prophets which are read every sabbath day they have fulfilled them in condemning him
and though they found no cause of death in him yet desired they pilate that he should be slain
and when they had fulfilled all that was written of him they took him down from the tree and laid him in a sepulchre
but god raised him from the dead
and he was seen many days of them which came up with him from galilee to jerusalem who are his witnesses unto the people
and we declare unto you glad tidings how that the promise which was made unto the fathers
god hath fulfilled the same unto us their children in that he hath raised up jesus again as it is also written in the second psalm thou art my son this day have i begotten thee
and as concerning that he raised him up from the dead now no more to return to corruption he said on this wise i will give you the sure mercies of david
wherefore he saith also in another psalm thou shalt not suffer thine holy one to see corruption
