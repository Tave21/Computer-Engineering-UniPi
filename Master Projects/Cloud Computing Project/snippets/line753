 then thieves and robbers range abroad unseen
 in murders and in outrage boldly here
 but when from under this terrestrial ball
 he fires the proud tops of the eastern pines
 and darts his light through every guilty hole
 then murders treasons and detested sins
 the cloak of night being pluck'd from off their backs
 stand bare and naked trembling at themselves
 so when this thief this traitor bolingbroke
 who all this while hath revell'd in the night
 whilst we were wandering with the antipodes
 shall see us rising in our throne the east
 his treasons will sit blushing in his face
 not able to endure the sight of day
 but selfaffrighted tremble at his sin
 not all the water in the rough rude sea
 can wash the balm off from an anointed king
 the breath of worldly men cannot depose
 the deputy elected by the lord
 for every man that bolingbroke hath press'd
 to lift shrewd steel against our golden crown
 god for his richard hath in heavenly pay
 a glorious angel then if angels fight
 weak men must fall for heaven still guards the right
 enter earl of salisbury
 welcome my lord how far off lies your power
earl of salisbury nor near nor farther off my gracious lord
 than this weak arm discomfort guides my tongue
 and bids me speak of nothing but despair
 one day too late i fear me noble lord
 hath clouded all thy happy days on earth
 o call back yesterday bid time return
 and thou shalt have twelve thousand fighting men
 today today unhappy day too late
 o'erthrows thy joys friends fortune and thy state
 for all the welshmen hearing thou wert dead
 are gone to bolingbroke dispersed and fled
duke of aumerle comfort my liege why looks your grace so pale
king richard ii but now the blood of twenty thousand men
 did triumph in my face and they are fled
 and till so much blood thither come again
 have i not reason to look pale and dead
 all souls that will be safe fly from my side
 for time hath set a blot upon my pride
duke of aumerle comfort my liege remember who you are
king richard ii i had forgot myself am i not king
 awake thou coward majesty thou sleepest
 is not the king's name twenty thousand names
 arm arm my name a puny subject strikes
 at thy great glory look not to the ground
 ye favourites of a king are we not high
 high be our thoughts i know my uncle york
 hath power enough to serve our turn but who comes here
 enter sir stephen scroop
sir stephen scroop more health and happiness betide my liege
 than can my caretuned tongue deliver him
king richard ii mine ear is open and my heart prepared
 the worst is worldly loss thou canst unfold
 say is my kingdom lost why twas my care
 and what loss is it to be rid of care
 strives bolingbroke to be as great as we
 greater he shall not be if he serve god
 we'll serve him too and be his fellow so
 revolt our subjects that we cannot mend
 they break their faith to god as well as us
 cry woe destruction ruin and decay
 the worst is death and death will have his day
sir stephen scroop glad am i that your highness is so arm'd
 to bear the tidings of calamity
 like an unseasonable stormy day
 which makes the silver rivers drown their shores
 as if the world were all dissolved to tears
 so high above his limits swells the rage
 of bolingbroke covering your fearful land
 with hard bright steel and hearts harder than steel
 whitebeards have arm'd their thin and hairless scalps
 against thy majesty boys with women's voices
 strive to speak big and clap their female joints
 in stiff unwieldy arms against thy crown
 the very beadsmen learn to bend their bows
 of doublefatal yew against thy state
 yea distaffwomen manage rusty bills
 against thy seat both young and old rebel
 and all goes worse than i have power to tell
king richard ii too well too well thou tell'st a tale so ill
 where is the earl of wiltshire where is bagot
 what is become of bushy where is green
 that they have let the dangerous enemy
 measure our confines with such peaceful steps
 if we prevail their heads shall pay for it
 i warrant they have made peace with bolingbroke
sir stephen scroop peace have they made with him indeed my lord
king richard ii o villains vipers damn'd without redemption
 dogs easily won to fawn on any man
 snakes in my heartblood warm'd that sting my heart
 three judases each one thrice worse than judas
 would they make peace terrible hell make war
 upon their spotted souls for this offence
sir stephen scroop sweet love i see changing his property
 turns to the sourest and most deadly hate
 again uncurse their souls their peace is made
 with heads and not with hands those whom you curse
 have felt the worst of death's destroying wound
 and lie full low graved in the hollow ground
duke of aumerle is bushy green and the earl of wiltshire dead
sir stephen scroop ay all of them at bristol lost their heads
duke of aumerle where is the duke my father with his power
king richard ii no matter where of comfort no man speak
 let's talk of graves of worms and epitaphs
 make dust our paper and with rainy eyes
 write sorrow on the bosom of the earth
 let's choose executors and talk of wills
 and yet not so for what can we bequeath
 save our deposed bodies to the ground
 our lands our lives and all are bolingbroke's
 and nothing can we call our own but death
 and that small model of the barren earth
 which serves as paste and cover to our bones
 for god's sake let us sit upon the ground
 and tell sad stories of the death of kings
 how some have been deposed some slain in war
 some haunted by the ghosts they have deposed
 some poison'd by their wives some sleeping kill'd
 all murder'd for within the hollow crown
 that rounds the mortal temples of a king
 keeps death his court and there the antic sits
 scoffing his state and grinning at his pomp
 allowing him a breath a little scene
 to monarchize be fear'd and kill with looks
 infusing him with self and vain conceit
 as if this flesh which walls about our life
 were brass impregnable and humour'd thus
 comes at the last and with a little pin
 bores through his castle wall and farewell king
 cover your heads and mock not flesh and blood
 with solemn reverence throw away respect
 tradition form and ceremonious duty
 for you have but mistook me all this while
 i live with bread like you feel want
 taste grief need friends subjected thus
 how can you say to me i am a king
bishop of carlisle my lord wise men ne'er sit and wail their woes
 but presently prevent the ways to wail
 to fear the foe since fear oppresseth strength
 gives in your weakness strength unto your foe
 and so your follies fight against yourself
 fear and be slain no worse can come to fight
 and fight and die is death destroying death
 where fearing dying pays death servile breath
duke of aumerle my father hath a power inquire of him
 and learn to make a body of a limb
king richard ii thou chidest me well proud bolingbroke i come
 to change blows with thee for our day of doom
 this ague fit of fear is overblown
 an easy task it is to win our own
 say scroop where lies our uncle with his power
 speak sweetly man although thy looks be sour
sir stephen scroop men judge by the complexion of the sky
 the state and inclination of the day
 so may you by my dull and heavy eye
 my tongue hath but a heavier tale to say
 i play the torturer by small and small
 to lengthen out the worst that must be spoken
 your uncle york is join'd with bolingbroke
 and all your northern castles yielded up
 and all your southern gentlemen in arms
 upon his party
king richard ii thou hast said enough
 beshrew thee cousin which didst lead me forth
 to duke of aumerle
 of that sweet way i was in to despair
 what say you now what comfort have we now
 by heaven i'll hate him everlastingly
 that bids me be of comfort any more
 go to flint castle there i'll pine away
 a king woe's slave shall kingly woe obey
 that power i have discharge and let them go
 to ear the land that hath some hope to grow
 for i have none let no man speak again
 to alter this for counsel is but vain
duke of aumerle my liege one word
king richard ii he does me double wrong
 that wounds me with the flatteries of his tongue
 discharge my followers let them hence away
 from richard's night to bolingbroke's fair day
 exeunt
 king richard ii
act iii
scene iii wales before flint castle
 enter with drum and colours henry bolingbroke
 duke of york northumberland attendants and forces
henry bolingbroke so that by this intelligence we learn
 the welshmen are dispersed and salisbury
 is gone to meet the king who lately landed
 with some few private friends upon this coast
northumberland the news is very fair and good my lord
 richard not far from hence hath hid his head
duke of york it would beseem the lord northumberland
 to say king richard alack the heavy day
 when such a sacred king should hide his head
