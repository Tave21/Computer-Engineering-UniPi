 of aids incertain should not be admitted
archbishop of york tis very true lord bardolph for indeed
 it was young hotspur's case at shrewsbury
lord bardolph it was my lord who lined himself with hope
 eating the air on promise of supply
 flattering himself in project of a power
 much smaller than the smallest of his thoughts
 and so with great imagination
 proper to madmen led his powers to death
 and winking leap'd into destruction
hastings but by your leave it never yet did hurt
 to lay down likelihoods and forms of hope
lord bardolph yes if this present quality of war
 indeed the instant action a cause on foot
 lives so in hope as in an early spring
 we see the appearing buds which to prove fruit
 hope gives not so much warrant as despair
 that frosts will bite them when we mean to build
 we first survey the plot then draw the model
 and when we see the figure of the house
 then must we rate the cost of the erection
 which if we find outweighs ability
 what do we then but draw anew the model
 in fewer offices or at last desist
 to build at all much more in this great work
 which is almost to pluck a kingdom down
 and set another up should we survey
 the plot of situation and the model
 consent upon a sure foundation
 question surveyors know our own estate
 how able such a work to undergo
 to weigh against his opposite or else
 we fortify in paper and in figures
 using the names of men instead of men
 like one that draws the model of a house
 beyond his power to build it who half through
 gives o'er and leaves his partcreated cost
 a naked subject to the weeping clouds
 and waste for churlish winter's tyranny
hastings grant that our hopes yet likely of fair birth
 should be stillborn and that we now possess'd
 the utmost man of expectation
 i think we are a body strong enough
 even as we are to equal with the king
lord bardolph what is the king but five and twenty thousand
hastings to us no more nay not so much lord bardolph
 for his divisions as the times do brawl
 are in three heads one power against the french
 and one against glendower perforce a third
 must take up us so is the unfirm king
 in three divided and his coffers sound
 with hollow poverty and emptiness
archbishop of york that he should draw his several strengths together
 and come against us in full puissance
 need not be dreaded
hastings if he should do so
 he leaves his back unarm'd the french and welsh
 baying him at the heels never fear that
lord bardolph who is it like should lead his forces hither
hastings the duke of lancaster and westmoreland
 against the welsh himself and harry monmouth
 but who is substituted gainst the french
 i have no certain notice
archbishop of york let us on
 and publish the occasion of our arms
 the commonwealth is sick of their own choice
 their overgreedy love hath surfeited
 an habitation giddy and unsure
 hath he that buildeth on the vulgar heart
 o thou fond many with what loud applause
 didst thou beat heaven with blessing bolingbroke
 before he was what thou wouldst have him be
 and being now trimm'd in thine own desires
 thou beastly feeder art so full of him
 that thou provokest thyself to cast him up
 so so thou common dog didst thou disgorge
 thy glutton bosom of the royal richard
 and now thou wouldst eat thy dead vomit up
 and howl'st to find it what trust is in
 these times
 they that when richard lived would have him die
 are now become enamour'd on his grave
 thou that threw'st dust upon his goodly head
 when through proud london he came sighing on
 after the admired heels of bolingbroke
 criest now o earth yield us that king again
 and take thou this o thoughts of men accursed
 past and to come seems best things present worst
mowbray shall we go draw our numbers and set on
hastings we are time's subjects and time bids be gone
