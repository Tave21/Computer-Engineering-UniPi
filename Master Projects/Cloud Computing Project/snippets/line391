rosalind you say that you'll have phebe if she will
silvius though to have her and death were both one thing
rosalind i have promised to make all this matter even
 keep you your word o duke to give your daughter
 you yours orlando to receive his daughter
 keep your word phebe that you'll marry me
 or else refusing me to wed this shepherd
 keep your word silvius that you'll marry her
 if she refuse me and from hence i go
 to make these doubts all even
 exeunt rosalind and celia
duke senior i do remember in this shepherd boy
 some lively touches of my daughter's favour
orlando my lord the first time that i ever saw him
 methought he was a brother to your daughter
 but my good lord this boy is forestborn
 and hath been tutor'd in the rudiments
 of many desperate studies by his uncle
 whom he reports to be a great magician
 obscured in the circle of this forest
 enter touchstone and audrey
jaques there is sure another flood toward and these
 couples are coming to the ark here comes a pair of
 very strange beasts which in all tongues are called fools
touchstone salutation and greeting to you all
jaques good my lord bid him welcome this is the
 motleyminded gentleman that i have so often met in
 the forest he hath been a courtier he swears
touchstone if any man doubt that let him put me to my
 purgation i have trod a measure i have flattered
 a lady i have been politic with my friend smooth
 with mine enemy i have undone three tailors i have
 had four quarrels and like to have fought one
jaques and how was that ta'en up
touchstone faith we met and found the quarrel was upon the
 seventh cause
jaques how seventh cause good my lord like this fellow
duke senior i like him very well
touchstone god ild you sir i desire you of the like i
 press in here sir amongst the rest of the country
 copulatives to swear and to forswear according as
 marriage binds and blood breaks a poor virgin
 sir an illfavoured thing sir but mine own a poor
 humour of mine sir to take that that no man else
 will rich honesty dwells like a miser sir in a
 poor house as your pearl in your foul oyster
duke senior by my faith he is very swift and sententious
touchstone according to the fool's bolt sir and such dulcet diseases
jaques but for the seventh cause how did you find the
 quarrel on the seventh cause
touchstone upon a lie seven times removedbear your body more
 seeming audreyas thus sir i did dislike the
 cut of a certain courtier's beard he sent me word
 if i said his beard was not cut well he was in the
 mind it was this is called the retort courteous
 if i sent him word again it was not well cut he
 would send me word he cut it to please himself
 this is called the quip modest if again it was
 not well cut he disabled my judgment this is
 called the reply churlish if again it was not
 well cut he would answer i spake not true this
 is called the reproof valiant if again it was not
 well cut he would say i lied this is called the
 countercheque quarrelsome and so to the lie
 circumstantial and the lie direct
jaques and how oft did you say his beard was not well cut
touchstone i durst go no further than the lie circumstantial
 nor he durst not give me the lie direct and so we
 measured swords and parted
jaques can you nominate in order now the degrees of the lie
touchstone o sir we quarrel in print by the book as you have
 books for good manners i will name you the degrees
 the first the retort courteous the second the
 quip modest the third the reply churlish the
 fourth the reproof valiant the fifth the
 countercheque quarrelsome the sixth the lie with
 circumstance the seventh the lie direct all
 these you may avoid but the lie direct and you may
 avoid that too with an if i knew when seven
 justices could not take up a quarrel but when the
 parties were met themselves one of them thought but
 of an if as if you said so then i said so and
 they shook hands and swore brothers your if is the
 only peacemaker much virtue in if
jaques is not this a rare fellow my lord he's as good at
 any thing and yet a fool
duke senior he uses his folly like a stalkinghorse and under
 the presentation of that he shoots his wit

 enter jaques de boys
jaques de boys let me have audience for a word or two
 i am the second son of old sir rowland
 that bring these tidings to this fair assembly
 duke frederick hearing how that every day
 men of great worth resorted to this forest
 address'd a mighty power which were on foot
 in his own conduct purposely to take
 his brother here and put him to the sword
 and to the skirts of this wild wood he came
 where meeting with an old religious man
 after some question with him was converted
 both from his enterprise and from the world
 his crown bequeathing to his banish'd brother
 and all their lands restored to them again
 that were with him exiled this to be true
 i do engage my life
duke senior welcome young man
 thou offer'st fairly to thy brothers wedding
 to one his lands withheld and to the other
 a land itself at large a potent dukedom
 first in this forest let us do those ends
 that here were well begun and well begot
 and after every of this happy number
 that have endured shrewd days and nights with us
 shall share the good of our returned fortune
 according to the measure of their states
 meantime forget this newfall'n dignity
 and fall into our rustic revelry
 play music and you brides and bridegrooms all
 with measure heap'd in joy to the measures fall
jaques sir by your patience if i heard you rightly
 the duke hath put on a religious life
 and thrown into neglect the pompous court
jaques de boys he hath
jaques to him will i out of these convertites
 there is much matter to be heard and learn'd
 to duke senior
 you to your former honour i bequeath
 your patience and your virtue well deserves it
 to orlando
 you to a love that your true faith doth merit
 to oliver
 you to your land and love and great allies
 to silvius
 you to a long and welldeserved bed
 to touchstone
 and you to wrangling for thy loving voyage
 is but for two months victuall'd so to your pleasures
 i am for other than for dancing measures
duke senior stay jaques stay
jaques to see no pastime i what you would have
 i'll stay to know at your abandon'd cave
 exit
duke senior proceed proceed we will begin these rites
 as we do trust they'll end in true delights
 a dance
 as you like it
 epilogue
rosalind it is not the fashion to see the lady the epilogue
 but it is no more unhandsome than to see the lord
 the prologue if it be true that good wine needs
 no bush tis true that a good play needs no
 epilogue yet to good wine they do use good bushes
