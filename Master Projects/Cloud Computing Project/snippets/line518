 i the justice of compare o villain leonine
 whom thou hast poison'd too
 if thou hadst drunk to him t had been a kindness
 becoming well thy fact what canst thou say
 when noble pericles shall demand his child
dionyza that she is dead nurses are not the fates
 to foster it nor ever to preserve
 she died at night i'll say so who can cross it
 unless you play the pious innocent
 and for an honest attribute cry out
 she died by foul play'
cleon o go to well well
 of all the faults beneath the heavens the gods
 do like this worst
dionyza be one of those that think
 the petty wrens of tarsus will fly hence
 and open this to pericles i do shame
 to think of what a noble strain you are
 and of how coward a spirit
cleon to such proceeding
 who ever but his approbation added
 though not his prime consent he did not flow
 from honourable sources
dionyza be it so then
 yet none does know but you how she came dead
 nor none can know leonine being gone
 she did disdain my child and stood between
 her and her fortunes none would look on her
 but cast their gazes on marina's face
 whilst ours was blurted at and held a malkin
 not worth the time of day it pierced me through
 and though you call my course unnatural
 you not your child well loving yet i find
 it greets me as an enterprise of kindness
 perform'd to your sole daughter
cleon heavens forgive it
dionyza and as for pericles
 what should he say we wept after her hearse
 and yet we mourn her monument
 is almost finish'd and her epitaphs
 in glittering golden characters express
 a general praise to her and care in us
 at whose expense tis done
cleon thou art like the harpy
 which to betray dost with thine angel's face
 seize with thine eagle's talons
dionyza you are like one that superstitiously
 doth swear to the gods that winter kills the flies
 but yet i know you'll do as i advise

act iv
scene iv
 enter gower before the monument of marina at tarsus
gower thus time we waste and longest leagues make short
 sail seas in cockles have an wish but for't
 making to take your imagination
 from bourn to bourn region to region
 by you being pardon'd we commit no crime
 to use one language in each several clime
 where our scenes seem to live i do beseech you
 to learn of me who stand i the gaps to teach you
 the stages of our story pericles
 is now again thwarting the wayward seas
 attended on by many a lord and knight
 to see his daughter all his life's delight
 old escanes whom helicanus late
 advanced in time to great and high estate
 is left to govern bear you it in mind
 old helicanus goes along behind
 wellsailing ships and bounteous winds have brought
 this king to tarsusthink his pilot thought
 so with his steerage shall your thoughts grow on
 to fetch his daughter home who first is gone
 like motes and shadows see them move awhile
 your ears unto your eyes i'll reconcile
 dumb show
 enter pericles at one door with all his train
 cleon and dionyza at the other cleon shows
 pericles the tomb whereat pericles makes
 lamentation puts on sackcloth and in a mighty
 passion departs then exeunt cleon and dionyza
 see how belief may suffer by foul show
 this borrow'd passion stands for true old woe
 and pericles in sorrow all devour'd
 with sighs shot through and biggest tears
 o'ershower'd
 leaves tarsus and again embarks he swears
 never to wash his face nor cut his hairs
 he puts on sackcloth and to sea he bears
 a tempest which his mortal vessel tears
 and yet he rides it out now please you wit
 the epitaph is for marina writ
 by wicked dionyza
 reads the inscription on marina's monument
 the fairest sweet'st and best lies here
 who wither'd in her spring of year
 she was of tyrus the king's daughter
 on whom foul death hath made this slaughter
 marina was she call'd and at her birth
 thetis being proud swallow'd some part o the earth
 therefore the earth fearing to be o'erflow'd
 hath thetis birthchild on the heavens bestow'd
 wherefore she does and swears she'll never stint
 make raging battery upon shores of flint'
 no visor does become black villany
 so well as soft and tender flattery
 let pericles believe his daughter's dead
 and bear his courses to be ordered
 by lady fortune while our scene must play
 his daughter's woe and heavy welladay
 in her unholy service patience then
 and think you now are all in mytilene

 knees that she would make a puritan of the devil
