and out of the tribe of benjamin gibeon with her suburbs geba with her suburbs
anathoth with her suburbs and almon with her suburbs four cities
all the cities of the children of aaron the priests were thirteen cities with their suburbs
and the families of the children of kohath the levites which remained of the children of kohath even they had the cities of their lot out of the tribe of ephraim
for they gave them shechem with her suburbs in mount ephraim to be a city of refuge for the slayer and gezer with her suburbs
and kibzaim with her suburbs and bethhoron with her suburbs four cities
and out of the tribe of dan eltekeh with her suburbs gibbethon with her suburbs
aijalon with her suburbs gathrimmon with her suburbs four cities
and out of the half tribe of manasseh tanach with her suburbs and gathrimmon with her suburbs two cities
all the cities were ten with their suburbs for the families of the children of kohath that remained
and unto the children of gershon of the families of the levites out of the other half tribe of manasseh they gave golan in bashan with her suburbs to be a city of refuge for the slayer and beeshterah with her suburbs two cities
and out of the tribe of issachar kishon with her suburbs dabareh with her suburbs
jarmuth with her suburbs engannim with her suburbs four cities

dimnah with her suburbs nahalal with her suburbs four cities
and out of the tribe of reuben bezer with her suburbs and jahazah with her suburbs

and out of the tribe of gad ramoth in gilead with her suburbs to be a city of refuge for the slayer and mahanaim with her suburbs
heshbon with her suburbs jazer with her suburbs four cities in all
so all the cities for the children of merari by their families which were remaining of the families of the levites were by their lot twelve cities
all the cities of the levites within the possession of the children of israel were forty and eight cities with their suburbs
these cities were every one with their suburbs round about them thus were all these cities
and the lord gave unto israel all the land which he sware to give unto their fathers and they possessed it and dwelt therein
and the lord gave them rest round about according to all that he sware unto their fathers and there stood not a man of all their enemies before them the lord delivered all their enemies into their hand
there failed not ought of any good thing which the lord had spoken unto the house of israel all came to pass
then joshua called the reubenites and the gadites and the half tribe of manasseh
and said unto them ye have kept all that moses the servant of the lord commanded you and have obeyed my voice in all that i commanded you
ye have not left your brethren these many days unto this day but have kept the charge of the commandment of the lord your god
and now the lord your god hath given rest unto your brethren as he promised them therefore now return ye and get you unto your tents and unto the land of your possession which moses the servant of the lord gave you on the other side jordan
but take diligent heed to do the commandment and the law which moses the servant of the lord charged you to love the lord your god and to walk in all his ways and to keep his commandments and to cleave unto him and to serve him with all your heart and with all your soul
so joshua blessed them and sent them away and they went unto their tents
now to the one half of the tribe of manasseh moses had given possession in bashan but unto the other half thereof gave joshua among their brethren on this side jordan westward and when joshua sent them away also unto their tents then he blessed them
and he spake unto them saying return with much riches unto your tents and with very much cattle with silver and with gold and with brass and with iron and with very much raiment divide the spoil of your enemies with your brethren
and the children of reuben and the children of gad and the half tribe of manasseh returned and departed from the children of israel out of shiloh which is in the land of canaan to go unto the country of gilead to the land of their possession whereof they were possessed according to the word of the lord by the hand of moses
and when they came unto the borders of jordan that are in the land of canaan the children of reuben and the children of gad and the half tribe of manasseh built there an altar by jordan a great altar to see to
and the children of israel heard say behold the children of reuben and the children of gad and the half tribe of manasseh have built an altar over against the land of canaan in the borders of jordan at the passage of the children of israel
and when the children of israel heard of it the whole congregation of the children of israel gathered themselves together at shiloh to go up to war against them
and the children of israel sent unto the children of reuben and to the children of gad and to the half tribe of manasseh into the land of gilead phinehas the son of eleazar the priest
and with him ten princes of each chief house a prince throughout all the tribes of israel and each one was an head of the house of their fathers among the thousands of israel
and they came unto the children of reuben and to the children of gad and to the half tribe of manasseh unto the land of gilead and they spake with them saying
thus saith the whole congregation of the lord what trespass is this that ye have committed against the god of israel to turn away this day from following the lord in that ye have builded you an altar that ye might rebel this day against the lord
is the iniquity of peor too little for us from which we are not cleansed until this day although there was a plague in the congregation of the lord
but that ye must turn away this day from following the lord and it will be seeing ye rebel to day against the lord that to morrow he will be wroth with the whole congregation of israel
notwithstanding if the land of your possession be unclean then pass ye over unto the land of the possession of the lord wherein the lord's tabernacle dwelleth and take possession among us but rebel not against the lord nor rebel against us in building you an altar beside the altar of the lord our god
did not achan the son of zerah commit a trespass in the accursed thing and wrath fell on all the congregation of israel and that man perished not alone in his iniquity
then the children of reuben and the children of gad and the half tribe of manasseh answered and said unto the heads of the thousands of israel
the lord god of gods the lord god of gods he knoweth and israel he shall know if it be in rebellion or if in transgression against the lord save us not this day
that we have built us an altar to turn from following the lord or if to offer thereon burnt offering or meat offering or if to offer peace offerings thereon let the lord himself require it
and if we have not rather done it for fear of this thing saying in time to come your children might speak unto our children saying what have ye to do with the lord god of israel
for the lord hath made jordan a border between us and you ye children of reuben and children of gad ye have no part in the lord so shall your children make our children cease from fearing the lord
therefore we said let us now prepare to build us an altar not for burnt offering nor for sacrifice
but that it may be a witness between us and you and our generations after us that we might do the service of the lord before him with our burnt offerings and with our sacrifices and with our peace offerings that your children may not say to our children in time to come ye have no part in the lord
therefore said we that it shall be when they should so say to us or to our generations in time to come that we may say again behold the pattern of the altar of the lord which our fathers made not for burnt offerings nor for sacrifices but it is a witness between us and you
god forbid that we should rebel against the lord and turn this day from following the lord to build an altar for burnt offerings for meat offerings or for sacrifices beside the altar of the lord our god that is before his tabernacle
and when phinehas the priest and the princes of the congregation and heads of the thousands of israel which were with him heard the words that the children of reuben and the children of gad and the children of manasseh spake it pleased them
and phinehas the son of eleazar the priest said unto the children of reuben and to the children of gad and to the children of manasseh this day we perceive that the lord is among us because ye have not committed this trespass against the lord now ye have delivered the children of israel out of the hand of the lord
and phinehas the son of eleazar the priest and the princes returned from the children of reuben and from the children of gad out of the land of gilead unto the land of canaan to the children of israel and brought them word again
and the thing pleased the children of israel and the children of israel blessed god and did not intend to go up against them in battle to destroy the land wherein the children of reuben and gad dwelt
and the children of reuben and the children of gad called the altar ed for it shall be a witness between us that the lord is god
and it came to pass a long time after that the lord had given rest unto israel from all their enemies round about that joshua waxed old and stricken in age
and joshua called for all israel and for their elders and for their heads and for their judges and for their officers and said unto them i am old and stricken in age
and ye have seen all that the lord your god hath done unto all these nations because of you for the lord your god is he that hath fought for you
behold i have divided unto you by lot these nations that remain to be an inheritance for your tribes from jordan with all the nations that i have cut off even unto the great sea westward
and the lord your god he shall expel them from before you and drive them from out of your sight and ye shall possess their land as the lord your god hath promised unto you
be ye therefore very courageous to keep and to do all that is written in the book of the law of moses that ye turn not aside therefrom to the right hand or to the left
that ye come not among these nations these that remain among you neither make mention of the name of their gods nor cause to swear by them neither serve them nor bow yourselves unto them
but cleave unto the lord your god as ye have done unto this day
for the lord hath driven out from before you great nations and strong but as for you no man hath been able to stand before you unto this day
one man of you shall chase a thousand for the lord your god he it is that fighteth for you as he hath promised you
take good heed therefore unto yourselves that ye love the lord your god
else if ye do in any wise go back and cleave unto the remnant of these nations even these that remain among you and shall make marriages with them and go in unto them and they to you
know for a certainty that the lord your god will no more drive out any of these nations from before you but they shall be snares and traps unto you and scourges in your sides and thorns in your eyes until ye perish from off this good land which the lord your god hath given you
and behold this day i am going the way of all the earth and ye know in all your hearts and in all your souls that not one thing hath failed of all the good things which the lord your god spake concerning you all are come to pass unto you and not one thing hath failed thereof
therefore it shall come to pass that as all good things are come upon you which the lord your god promised you so shall the lord bring upon you all evil things until he have destroyed you from off this good land which the lord your god hath given you
when ye have transgressed the covenant of the lord your god which he commanded you and have gone and served other gods and bowed yourselves to them then shall the anger of the lord be kindled against you and ye shall perish quickly from off the good land which he hath given unto you
and joshua gathered all the tribes of israel to shechem and called for the elders of israel and for their heads and for their judges and for their officers and they presented themselves before god
and joshua said unto all the people thus saith the lord god of israel your fathers dwelt on the other side of the flood in old time even terah the father of abraham and the father of nachor and they served other gods
and i took your father abraham from the other side of the flood and led him throughout all the land of canaan and multiplied his seed and gave him isaac
and i gave unto isaac jacob and esau and i gave unto esau mount seir to possess it but jacob and his children went down into egypt
i sent moses also and aaron and i plagued egypt according to that which i did among them and afterward i brought you out
and i brought your fathers out of egypt and ye came unto the sea and the egyptians pursued after your fathers with chariots and horsemen unto the red sea
and when they cried unto the lord he put darkness between you and the egyptians and brought the sea upon them and covered them and your eyes have seen what i have done in egypt and ye dwelt in the wilderness a long season
and i brought you into the land of the amorites which dwelt on the other side jordan and they fought with you and i gave them into your hand that ye might possess their land and i destroyed them from before you
then balak the son of zippor king of moab arose and warred against israel and sent and called balaam the son of beor to curse you
but i would not hearken unto balaam therefore he blessed you still so i delivered you out of his hand
and ye went over jordan and came unto jericho and the men of jericho fought against you the amorites and the perizzites and the canaanites and the hittites and the girgashites the hivites and the jebusites and i delivered them into your hand
and i sent the hornet before you which drave them out from before you even the two kings of the amorites but not with thy sword nor with thy bow
and i have given you a land for which ye did not labour and cities which ye built not and ye dwell in them of the vineyards and oliveyards which ye planted not do ye eat
now therefore fear the lord and serve him in sincerity and in truth and put away the gods which your fathers served on the other side of the flood and in egypt and serve ye the lord
and if it seem evil unto you to serve the lord choose you this day whom ye will serve whether the gods which your fathers served that were on the other side of the flood or the gods of the amorites in whose land ye dwell but as for me and my house we will serve the lord
and the people answered and said god forbid that we should forsake the lord to serve other gods
for the lord our god he it is that brought us up and our fathers out of the land of egypt from the house of bondage and which did those great signs in our sight and preserved us in all the way wherein we went and among all the people through whom we passed
and the lord drave out from before us all the people even the amorites which dwelt in the land therefore will we also serve the lord for he is our god
and joshua said unto the people ye cannot serve the lord for he is an holy god he is a jealous god he will not forgive your transgressions nor your sins
if ye forsake the lord and serve strange gods then he will turn and do you hurt and consume you after that he hath done you good
and the people said unto joshua nay but we will serve the lord
and joshua said unto the people ye are witnesses against yourselves that ye have chosen you the lord to serve him and they said we are witnesses
now therefore put away said he the strange gods which are among you and incline your heart unto the lord god of israel
and the people said unto joshua the lord our god will we serve and his voice will we obey
so joshua made a covenant with the people that day and set them a statute and an ordinance in shechem
and joshua wrote these words in the book of the law of god and took a great stone and set it up there under an oak that was by the sanctuary of the lord
and joshua said unto all the people behold this stone shall be a witness unto us for it hath heard all the words of the lord which he spake unto us it shall be therefore a witness unto you lest ye deny your god
so joshua let the people depart every man unto his inheritance
and it came to pass after these things that joshua the son of nun the servant of the lord died being an hundred and ten years old
and they buried him in the border of his inheritance in timnathserah which is in mount ephraim on the north side of the hill of gaash
and israel served the lord all the days of joshua and all the days of the elders that overlived joshua and which had known all the works of the lord that he had done for israel
and the bones of joseph which the children of israel brought up out of egypt buried they in shechem in a parcel of ground which jacob bought of the sons of hamor the father of shechem for an hundred pieces of silver and it became the inheritance of the children of joseph
and eleazar the son of aaron died and they buried him in a hill that pertained to phinehas his son which was given him in mount ephraim
now after the death of joshua it came to pass that the children of israel asked the lord saying who shall go up for us against the canaanites first to fight against them
and the lord said judah shall go up behold i have delivered the land into his hand
and judah said unto simeon his brother come up with me into my lot that we may fight against the canaanites and i likewise will go with thee into thy lot so simeon went with him
and judah went up and the lord delivered the canaanites and the perizzites into their hand and they slew of them in bezek ten thousand men
and they found adonibezek in bezek and they fought against him and they slew the canaanites and the perizzites
but adonibezek fled and they pursued after him and caught him and cut off his thumbs and his great toes
and adonibezek said threescore and ten kings having their thumbs and their great toes cut off gathered their meat under my table as i have done so god hath requited me and they brought him to jerusalem and there he died
now the children of judah had fought against jerusalem and had taken it and smitten it with the edge of the sword and set the city on fire
and afterward the children of judah went down to fight against the canaanites that dwelt in the mountain and in the south and in the valley
and judah went against the canaanites that dwelt in hebron now the name of hebron before was kirjatharba and they slew sheshai and ahiman and talmai
and from thence he went against the inhabitants of debir and the name of debir before was kirjathsepher
and caleb said he that smiteth kirjathsepher and taketh it to him will i give achsah my daughter to wife
and othniel the son of kenaz caleb's younger brother took it and he gave him achsah his daughter to wife
and it came to pass when she came to him that she moved him to ask of her father a field and she lighted from off her ass and caleb said unto her what wilt thou
and she said unto him give me a blessing for thou hast given me a south land give me also springs of water and caleb gave her the upper springs and the nether springs
and the children of the kenite moses father in law went up out of the city of palm trees with the children of judah into the wilderness of judah which lieth in the south of arad and they went and dwelt among the people
and judah went with simeon his brother and they slew the canaanites that inhabited zephath and utterly destroyed it and the name of the city was called hormah
also judah took gaza with the coast thereof and askelon with the coast thereof and ekron with the coast thereof
and the lord was with judah and he drave out the inhabitants of the mountain but could not drive out the inhabitants of the valley because they had chariots of iron
and they gave hebron unto caleb as moses said and he expelled thence the three sons of anak
and the children of benjamin did not drive out the jebusites that inhabited jerusalem but the jebusites dwell with the children of benjamin in jerusalem unto this day
and the house of joseph they also went up against bethel and the lord was with them
and the house of joseph sent to descry bethel now the name of the city before was luz
and the spies saw a man come forth out of the city and they said unto him shew us we pray thee the entrance into the city and we will shew thee mercy
and when he shewed them the entrance into the city they smote the city with the edge of the sword but they let go the man and all his family
and the man went into the land of the hittites and built a city and called the name thereof luz which is the name thereof unto this day
neither did manasseh drive out the inhabitants of bethshean and her towns nor taanach and her towns nor the inhabitants of dor and her towns nor the inhabitants of ibleam and her towns nor the inhabitants of megiddo and her towns but the canaanites would dwell in that land
and it came to pass when israel was strong that they put the canaanites to tribute and did not utterly drive them out
neither did ephraim drive out the canaanites that dwelt in gezer but the canaanites dwelt in gezer among them
neither did zebulun drive out the inhabitants of kitron nor the inhabitants of nahalol but the canaanites dwelt among them and became tributaries
neither did asher drive out the inhabitants of accho nor the inhabitants of zidon nor of ahlab nor of achzib nor of helbah nor of aphik nor of rehob
but the asherites dwelt among the canaanites the inhabitants of the land for they did not drive them out
neither did naphtali drive out the inhabitants of bethshemesh nor the inhabitants of bethanath but he dwelt among the canaanites the inhabitants of the land nevertheless the inhabitants of bethshemesh and of bethanath became tributaries unto them
and the amorites forced the children of dan into the mountain for they would not suffer them to come down to the valley
but the amorites would dwell in mount heres in aijalon and in shaalbim yet the hand of the house of joseph prevailed so that they became tributaries
and the coast of the amorites was from the going up to akrabbim from the rock and upward
and an angel of the lord came up from gilgal to bochim and said i made you to go up out of egypt and have brought you unto the land which i sware unto your fathers and i said i will never break my covenant with you
and ye shall make no league with the inhabitants of this land ye shall throw down their altars but ye have not obeyed my voice why have ye done this
wherefore i also said i will not drive them out from before you but they shall be as thorns in your sides and their gods shall be a snare unto you
and it came to pass when the angel of the lord spake these words unto all the children of israel that the people lifted up their voice and wept
and they called the name of that place bochim and they sacrificed there unto the lord
and when joshua had let the people go the children of israel went every man unto his inheritance to possess the land
and the people served the lord all the days of joshua and all the days of the elders that outlived joshua who had seen all the great works of the lord that he did for israel
and joshua the son of nun the servant of the lord died being an hundred and ten years old
and they buried him in the border of his inheritance in timnathheres in the mount of ephraim on the north side of the hill gaash
and also all that generation were gathered unto their fathers and there arose another generation after them which knew not the lord nor yet the works which he had done for israel
and the children of israel did evil in the sight of the lord and served baalim
and they forsook the lord god of their fathers which brought them out of the land of egypt and followed other gods of the gods of the people that were round about them and bowed themselves unto them and provoked the lord to anger
and they forsook the lord and served baal and ashtaroth
and the anger of the lord was hot against israel and he delivered them into the hands of spoilers that spoiled them and he sold them into the hands of their enemies round about so that they could not any longer stand before their enemies
whithersoever they went out the hand of the lord was against them for evil as the lord had said and as the lord had sworn unto them and they were greatly distressed
nevertheless the lord raised up judges which delivered them out of the hand of those that spoiled them
and yet they would not hearken unto their judges but they went a whoring after other gods and bowed themselves unto them they turned quickly out of the way which their fathers walked in obeying the commandments of the lord but they did not so
and when the lord raised them up judges then the lord was with the judge and delivered them out of the hand of their enemies all the days of the judge for it repented the lord because of their groanings by reason of them that oppressed them and vexed them
and it came to pass when the judge was dead that they returned and corrupted themselves more than their fathers in following other gods to serve them and to bow down unto them they ceased not from their own doings nor from their stubborn way
and the anger of the lord was hot against israel and he said because that this people hath transgressed my covenant which i commanded their fathers and have not hearkened unto my voice
i also will not henceforth drive out any from before them of the nations which joshua left when he died
that through them i may prove israel whether they will keep the way of the lord to walk therein as their fathers did keep it or not
therefore the lord left those nations without driving them out hastily neither delivered he them into the hand of joshua
now these are the nations which the lord left to prove israel by them even as many of israel as had not known all the wars of canaan
only that the generations of the children of israel might know to teach them war at the least such as before knew nothing thereof
namely five lords of the philistines and all the canaanites and the sidonians and the hivites that dwelt in mount lebanon from mount baalhermon unto the entering in of hamath
and they were to prove israel by them to know whether they would hearken unto the commandments of the lord which he commanded their fathers by the hand of moses
and the children of israel dwelt among the canaanites hittites and amorites and perizzites and hivites and jebusites
and they took their daughters to be their wives and gave their daughters to their sons and served their gods
and the children of israel did evil in the sight of the lord and forgat the lord their god and served baalim and the groves
therefore the anger of the lord was hot against israel and he sold them into the hand of chushanrishathaim king of mesopotamia and the children of israel served chushanrishathaim eight years
and when the children of israel cried unto the lord the lord raised up a deliverer to the children of israel who delivered them even othniel the son of kenaz caleb's younger brother
and the spirit of the lord came upon him and he judged israel and went out to war and the lord delivered chushanrishathaim king of mesopotamia into his hand and his hand prevailed against chushanrishathaim
and the land had rest forty years and othniel the son of kenaz died
and the children of israel did evil again in the sight of the lord and the lord strengthened eglon the king of moab against israel because they had done evil in the sight of the lord
and he gathered unto him the children of ammon and amalek and went and smote israel and possessed the city of palm trees
so the children of israel served eglon the king of moab eighteen years
but when the children of israel cried unto the lord the lord raised them up a deliverer ehud the son of gera a benjamite a man lefthanded and by him the children of israel sent a present unto eglon the king of moab
but ehud made him a dagger which had two edges of a cubit length and he did gird it under his raiment upon his right thigh
and he brought the present unto eglon king of moab and eglon was a very fat man
and when he had made an end to offer the present he sent away the people that bare the present
but he himself turned again from the quarries that were by gilgal and said i have a secret errand unto thee o king who said keep silence and all that stood by him went out from him
and ehud came unto him and he was sitting in a summer parlour which he had for himself alone and ehud said i have a message from god unto thee and he arose out of his seat
and ehud put forth his left hand and took the dagger from his right thigh and thrust it into his belly
and the haft also went in after the blade and the fat closed upon the blade so that he could not draw the dagger out of his belly and the dirt came out
then ehud went forth through the porch and shut the doors of the parlour upon him and locked them
when he was gone out his servants came and when they saw that behold the doors of the parlour were locked they said surely he covereth his feet in his summer chamber
and they tarried till they were ashamed and behold he opened not the doors of the parlour therefore they took a key and opened them and behold their lord was fallen down dead on the earth
and ehud escaped while they tarried and passed beyond the quarries and escaped unto seirath
and it came to pass when he was come that he blew a trumpet in the mountain of ephraim and the children of israel went down with him from the mount and he before them
and he said unto them follow after me for the lord hath delivered your enemies the moabites into your hand and they went down after him and took the fords of jordan toward moab and suffered not a man to pass over
and they slew of moab at that time about ten thousand men all lusty and all men of valour and there escaped not a man
