 as thou hast done with mewhat jessica
 and sleep and snore and rend apparel out
 why jessica i say
launcelot why jessica
shylock who bids thee call i do not bid thee call
launcelot your worship was wont to tell me that
 i could do nothing without bidding
 enter jessica
jessica call you what is your will
shylock i am bid forth to supper jessica
 there are my keys but wherefore should i go
 i am not bid for love they flatter me
 but yet i'll go in hate to feed upon
 the prodigal christian jessica my girl

 there is some ill abrewing towards my rest
 for i did dream of moneybags tonight
launcelot i beseech you sir go my young master doth expect
 your reproach
shylock so do i his
launcelot an they have conspired together i will not say you
 shall see a masque but if you do then it was not
 for nothing that my nose fell ableeding on
 blackmonday last at six o'clock i the morning
 falling out that year on ashwednesday was four
 year in the afternoon
shylock what are there masques hear you me jessica
 lock up my doors and when you hear the drum
 and the vile squealing of the wryneck'd fife
 clamber not you up to the casements then
 nor thrust your head into the public street
 to gaze on christian fools with varnish'd faces
 but stop my house's ears i mean my casements
 let not the sound of shallow foppery enter
 my sober house by jacob's staff i swear
 i have no mind of feasting forth tonight
 but i will go go you before me sirrah
 say i will come
launcelot i will go before sir mistress look out at
 window for all this there will come a christian
 boy will be worth a jewess eye
 exit
shylock what says that fool of hagar's offspring ha
jessica his words were farewell mistress nothing else
shylock the patch is kind enough but a huge feeder
 snailslow in profit and he sleeps by day
 more than the wildcat drones hive not with me
 therefore i part with him and part with him
 to one that would have him help to waste
 his borrow'd purse well jessica go in
 perhaps i will return immediately
 do as i bid you shut doors after you
 fast bind fast find
 a proverb never stale in thrifty mind
 exit
jessica farewell and if my fortune be not crost
 i have a father you a daughter lost

scene vi the same
 enter gratiano and salarino masqued
gratiano this is the penthouse under which lorenzo
 desired us to make stand
salarino his hour is almost past
gratiano and it is marvel he outdwells his hour
 for lovers ever run before the clock
salarino o ten times faster venus pigeons fly
 to seal love's bonds newmade than they are wont
 to keep obliged faith unforfeited
gratiano that ever holds who riseth from a feast
 with that keen appetite that he sits down
 where is the horse that doth untread again
 his tedious measures with the unbated fire
 that he did pace them first all things that are
 are with more spirit chased than enjoy'd
 how like a younker or a prodigal
 the scarfed bark puts from her native bay
 hugg'd and embraced by the strumpet wind
 how like the prodigal doth she return
 with overweather'd ribs and ragged sails
 lean rent and beggar'd by the strumpet wind
salarino here comes lorenzo more of this hereafter
 enter lorenzo
lorenzo sweet friends your patience for my long abode
 not i but my affairs have made you wait
 when you shall please to play the thieves for wives
 i'll watch as long for you then approach
 here dwells my father jew ho who's within
 enter jessica above in boy's clothes
jessica who are you tell me for more certainty
 albeit i'll swear that i do know your tongue
lorenzo lorenzo and thy love
jessica lorenzo certain and my love indeed
 for who love i so much and now who knows
 but you lorenzo whether i am yours
lorenzo heaven and thy thoughts are witness that thou art
jessica here catch this casket it is worth the pains
 i am glad tis night you do not look on me
 for i am much ashamed of my exchange
 but love is blind and lovers cannot see
 the pretty follies that themselves commit
 for if they could cupid himself would blush
 to see me thus transformed to a boy
lorenzo descend for you must be my torchbearer
jessica what must i hold a candle to my shames
 they in themselves goodsooth are too too light
 why tis an office of discovery love
 and i should be obscured
lorenzo so are you sweet
 even in the lovely garnish of a boy
 but come at once
 for the close night doth play the runaway
 and we are stay'd for at bassanio's feast
jessica i will make fast the doors and gild myself
 with some more ducats and be with you straight
 exit above
gratiano now by my hood a gentile and no jew
lorenzo beshrew me but i love her heartily
 for she is wise if i can judge of her
 and fair she is if that mine eyes be true
 and true she is as she hath proved herself
 and therefore like herself wise fair and true
 shall she be placed in my constant soul
 enter jessica below
 what art thou come on gentlemen away
 our masquing mates by this time for us stay
 exit with jessica and salarino
 enter antonio

 than to be under sail and gone tonight
