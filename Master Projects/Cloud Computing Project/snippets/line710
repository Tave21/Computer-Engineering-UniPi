act v
 prologue
 enter chorus
chorus vouchsafe to those that have not read the story
 that i may prompt them and of such as have
 i humbly pray them to admit the excuse
 of time of numbers and due course of things
 which cannot in their huge and proper life
 be here presented now we bear the king
 toward calais grant him there there seen
 heave him away upon your winged thoughts
 athwart the sea behold the english beach
 pales in the flood with men with wives and boys
 whose shouts and claps outvoice the deep mouth'd sea
 which like a mighty whiffler fore the king
 seems to prepare his way so let him land
 and solemnly see him set on to london
 so swift a pace hath thought that even now
 you may imagine him upon blackheath
 where that his lords desire him to have borne
 his bruised helmet and his bended sword
 before him through the city he forbids it
 being free from vainness and selfglorious pride
 giving full trophy signal and ostent
 quite from himself to god but now behold
 in the quick forge and workinghouse of thought
 how london doth pour out her citizens
 the mayor and all his brethren in best sort
 like to the senators of the antique rome
 with the plebeians swarming at their heels
 go forth and fetch their conquering caesar in
 as by a lower but loving likelihood
 were now the general of our gracious empress
 as in good time he may from ireland coming
 bringing rebellion broached on his sword
 how many would the peaceful city quit
 to welcome him much more and much more cause
 did they this harry now in london place him
 as yet the lamentation of the french
 invites the king of england's stay at home
 the emperor's coming in behalf of france
 to order peace between them and omit
 all the occurrences whatever chanced
 till harry's backreturn again to france
 there must we bring him and myself have play'd
 the interim by remembering you tis past
 then brook abridgment and your eyes advance
 after your thoughts straight back again to france
