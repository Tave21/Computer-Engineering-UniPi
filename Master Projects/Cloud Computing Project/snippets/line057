2chr103 and they sent and called him so jeroboam and all israel came and spake to rehoboam saying
2chr104 thy father made our yoke grievous now therefore ease thou somewhat the grievous servitude of thy father and his heavy yoke that he put upon us and we will serve thee
2chr105 and he said unto them come again unto me after three days and the people departed
2chr106 and king rehoboam took counsel with the old men that had stood before solomon his father while he yet lived saying what counsel give ye me to return answer to this people
2chr107 and they spake unto him saying if thou be kind to this people and please them and speak good words to them they will be thy servants for ever
2chr108 but he forsook the counsel which the old men gave him and took counsel with the young men that were brought up with him that stood before him
2chr109 and he said unto them what advice give ye that we may return answer to this people which have spoken to me saying ease somewhat the yoke that thy father did put upon us
2chr1010 and the young men that were brought up with him spake unto him saying thus shalt thou answer the people that spake unto thee saying thy father made our yoke heavy but make thou it somewhat lighter for us thus shalt thou say unto them my little finger shall be thicker than my father's loins
2chr1011 for whereas my father put a heavy yoke upon you i will put more to your yoke my father chastised you with whips but i will chastise you with scorpions
2chr1012 so jeroboam and all the people came to rehoboam on the third day as the king bade saying come again to me on the third day
2chr1013 and the king answered them roughly and king rehoboam forsook the counsel of the old men
2chr1014 and answered them after the advice of the young men saying my father made your yoke heavy but i will add thereto my father chastised you with whips but i will chastise you with scorpions
2chr1015 so the king hearkened not unto the people for the cause was of god that the lord might perform his word which he spake by the hand of ahijah the shilonite to jeroboam the son of nebat
2chr1016 and when all israel saw that the king would not hearken unto them the people answered the king saying what portion have we in david and we have none inheritance in the son of jesse every man to your tents o israel and now david see to thine own house so all israel went to their tents
2chr1017 but as for the children of israel that dwelt in the cities of judah rehoboam reigned over them
2chr1018 then king rehoboam sent hadoram that was over the tribute and the children of israel stoned him with stones that he died but king rehoboam made speed to get him up to his chariot to flee to jerusalem
2chr1019 and israel rebelled against the house of david unto this day
2chr111 and when rehoboam was come to jerusalem he gathered of the house of judah and benjamin an hundred and fourscore thousand chosen men which were warriors to fight against israel that he might bring the kingdom again to rehoboam
2chr112 but the word of the lord came to shemaiah the man of god saying
2chr113 speak unto rehoboam the son of solomon king of judah and to all israel in judah and benjamin saying
2chr114 thus saith the lord ye shall not go up nor fight against your brethren return every man to his house for this thing is done of me and they obeyed the words of the lord and returned from going against jeroboam
2chr115 and rehoboam dwelt in jerusalem and built cities for defence in judah
2chr116 he built even bethlehem and etam and tekoa
2chr117 and bethzur and shoco and adullam
2chr118 and gath and mareshah and ziph
2chr119 and adoraim and lachish and azekah
2chr1110 and zorah and aijalon and hebron which are in judah and in benjamin fenced cities
2chr1111 and he fortified the strong holds and put captains in them and store of victual and of oil and wine
2chr1112 and in every several city he put shields and spears and made them exceeding strong having judah and benjamin on his side
2chr1113 and the priests and the levites that were in all israel resorted to him out of all their coasts
2chr1114 for the levites left their suburbs and their possession and came to judah and jerusalem for jeroboam and his sons had cast them off from executing the priest's office unto the lord
2chr1115 and he ordained him priests for the high places and for the devils and for the calves which he had made
2chr1116 and after them out of all the tribes of israel such as set their hearts to seek the lord god of israel came to jerusalem to sacrifice unto the lord god of their fathers
2chr1117 so they strengthened the kingdom of judah and made rehoboam the son of solomon strong three years for three years they walked in the way of david and solomon
2chr1118 and rehoboam took him mahalath the daughter of jerimoth the son of david to wife and abihail the daughter of eliab the son of jesse
2chr1119 which bare him children jeush and shamariah and zaham
2chr1120 and after her he took maachah the daughter of absalom which bare him abijah and attai and ziza and shelomith
2chr1121 and rehoboam loved maachah the daughter of absalom above all his wives and his concubines for he took eighteen wives and threescore concubines and begat twenty and eight sons and threescore daughters
2chr1122 and rehoboam made abijah the son of maachah the chief to be ruler among his brethren for he thought to make him king
2chr1123 and he dealt wisely and dispersed of all his children throughout all the countries of judah and benjamin unto every fenced city and he gave them victual in abundance and he desired many wives
2chr121 and it came to pass when rehoboam had established the kingdom and had strengthened himself he forsook the law of the lord and all israel with him
2chr122 and it came to pass that in the fifth year of king rehoboam shishak king of egypt came up against jerusalem because they had transgressed against the lord
2chr123 with twelve hundred chariots and threescore thousand horsemen and the people were without number that came with him out of egypt the lubims the sukkiims and the ethiopians
2chr124 and he took the fenced cities which pertained to judah and came to jerusalem
2chr125 then came shemaiah the prophet to rehoboam and to the princes of judah that were gathered together to jerusalem because of shishak and said unto them thus saith the lord ye have forsaken me and therefore have i also left you in the hand of shishak
2chr126 whereupon the princes of israel and the king humbled themselves and they said the lord is righteous
2chr127 and when the lord saw that they humbled themselves the word of the lord came to shemaiah saying they have humbled themselves therefore i will not destroy them but i will grant them some deliverance and my wrath shall not be poured out upon jerusalem by the hand of shishak
2chr128 nevertheless they shall be his servants that they may know my service and the service of the kingdoms of the countries
2chr129 so shishak king of egypt came up against jerusalem and took away the treasures of the house of the lord and the treasures of the king's house he took all he carried away also the shields of gold which solomon had made
2chr1210 instead of which king rehoboam made shields of brass and committed them to the hands of the chief of the guard that kept the entrance of the king's house
2chr1211 and when the king entered into the house of the lord the guard came and fetched them and brought them again into the guard chamber
2chr1212 and when he humbled himself the wrath of the lord turned from him that he would not destroy him altogether and also in judah things went well
2chr1213 so king rehoboam strengthened himself in jerusalem and reigned for rehoboam was one and forty years old when he began to reign and he reigned seventeen years in jerusalem the city which the lord had chosen out of all the tribes of israel to put his name there and his mother's name was naamah an ammonitess
2chr1214 and he did evil because he prepared not his heart to seek the lord
2chr1215 now the acts of rehoboam first and last are they not written in the book of shemaiah the prophet and of iddo the seer concerning genealogies and there were wars between rehoboam and jeroboam continually
2chr1216 and rehoboam slept with his fathers and was buried in the city of david and abijah his son reigned in his stead
2chr131 now in the eighteenth year of king jeroboam began abijah to reign over judah
2chr132 he reigned three years in jerusalem his mother's name also was michaiah the daughter of uriel of gibeah and there was war between abijah and jeroboam
2chr133 and abijah set the battle in array with an army of valiant men of war even four hundred thousand chosen men jeroboam also set the battle in array against him with eight hundred thousand chosen men being mighty men of valour
2chr134 and abijah stood up upon mount zemaraim which is in mount ephraim and said hear me thou jeroboam and all israel
2chr135 ought ye not to know that the lord god of israel gave the kingdom over israel to david for ever even to him and to his sons by a covenant of salt
2chr136 yet jeroboam the son of nebat the servant of solomon the son of david is risen up and hath rebelled against his lord
2chr137 and there are gathered unto him vain men the children of belial and have strengthened themselves against rehoboam the son of solomon when rehoboam was young and tenderhearted and could not withstand them
2chr138 and now ye think to withstand the kingdom of the lord in the hand of the sons of david and ye be a great multitude and there are with you golden calves which jeroboam made you for gods
2chr139 have ye not cast out the priests of the lord the sons of aaron and the levites and have made you priests after the manner of the nations of other lands so that whosoever cometh to consecrate himself with a young bullock and seven rams the same may be a priest of them that are no gods
2chr1310 but as for us the lord is our god and we have not forsaken him and the priests which minister unto the lord are the sons of aaron and the levites wait upon their business
2chr1311 and they burn unto the lord every morning and every evening burnt sacrifices and sweet incense the shewbread also set they in order upon the pure table and the candlestick of gold with the lamps thereof to burn every evening for we keep the charge of the lord our god but ye have forsaken him
2chr1312 and behold god himself is with us for our captain and his priests with sounding trumpets to cry alarm against you o children of israel fight ye not against the lord god of your fathers for ye shall not prosper
2chr1313 but jeroboam caused an ambushment to come about behind them so they were before judah and the ambushment was behind them
2chr1314 and when judah looked back behold the battle was before and behind and they cried unto the lord and the priests sounded with the trumpets
2chr1315 then the men of judah gave a shout and as the men of judah shouted it came to pass that god smote jeroboam and all israel before abijah and judah
2chr1316 and the children of israel fled before judah and god delivered them into their hand
2chr1317 and abijah and his people slew them with a great slaughter so there fell down slain of israel five hundred thousand chosen men
2chr1318 thus the children of israel were brought under at that time and the children of judah prevailed because they relied upon the lord god of their fathers
2chr1319 and abijah pursued after jeroboam and took cities from him bethel with the towns thereof and jeshanah with the towns thereof and ephrain with the towns thereof
2chr1320 neither did jeroboam recover strength again in the days of abijah and the lord struck him and he died
2chr1321 but abijah waxed mighty and married fourteen wives and begat twenty and two sons and sixteen daughters
2chr1322 and the rest of the acts of abijah and his ways and his sayings are written in the story of the prophet iddo
2chr141 so abijah slept with his fathers and they buried him in the city of david and asa his son reigned in his stead in his days the land was quiet ten years
2chr142 and asa did that which was good and right in the eyes of the lord his god
2chr143 for he took away the altars of the strange gods and the high places and brake down the images and cut down the groves
2chr144 and commanded judah to seek the lord god of their fathers and to do the law and the commandment
2chr145 also he took away out of all the cities of judah the high places and the images and the kingdom was quiet before him
2chr146 and he built fenced cities in judah for the land had rest and he had no war in those years because the lord had given him rest
2chr147 therefore he said unto judah let us build these cities and make about them walls and towers gates and bars while the land is yet before us because we have sought the lord our god we have sought him and he hath given us rest on every side so they built and prospered
2chr148 and asa had an army of men that bare targets and spears out of judah three hundred thousand and out of benjamin that bare shields and drew bows two hundred and fourscore thousand all these were mighty men of valour
2chr149 and there came out against them zerah the ethiopian with an host of a thousand thousand and three hundred chariots and came unto mareshah
2chr1410 then asa went out against him and they set the battle in array in the valley of zephathah at mareshah
2chr1411 and asa cried unto the lord his god and said lord it is nothing with thee to help whether with many or with them that have no power help us o lord our god for we rest on thee and in thy name we go against this multitude o lord thou art our god let not man prevail against thee
2chr1412 so the lord smote the ethiopians before asa and before judah and the ethiopians fled
2chr1413 and asa and the people that were with him pursued them unto gerar and the ethiopians were overthrown that they could not recover themselves for they were destroyed before the lord and before his host and they carried away very much spoil
2chr1414 and they smote all the cities round about gerar for the fear of the lord came upon them and they spoiled all the cities for there was exceeding much spoil in them
2chr1415 they smote also the tents of cattle and carried away sheep and camels in abundance and returned to jerusalem
2chr151 and the spirit of god came upon azariah the son of oded
2chr152 and he went out to meet asa and said unto him hear ye me asa and all judah and benjamin the lord is with you while ye be with him and if ye seek him he will be found of you but if ye forsake him he will forsake you
2chr153 now for a long season israel hath been without the true god and without a teaching priest and without law
2chr154 but when they in their trouble did turn unto the lord god of israel and sought him he was found of them
2chr155 and in those times there was no peace to him that went out nor to him that came in but great vexations were upon all the inhabitants of the countries
2chr156 and nation was destroyed of nation and city of city for god did vex them with all adversity
2chr157 be ye strong therefore and let not your hands be weak for your work shall be rewarded
2chr158 and when asa heard these words and the prophecy of oded the prophet he took courage and put away the abominable idols out of all the land of judah and benjamin and out of the cities which he had taken from mount ephraim and renewed the altar of the lord that was before the porch of the lord
2chr159 and he gathered all judah and benjamin and the strangers with them out of ephraim and manasseh and out of simeon for they fell to him out of israel in abundance when they saw that the lord his god was with him
2chr1510 so they gathered themselves together at jerusalem in the third month in the fifteenth year of the reign of asa
2chr1511 and they offered unto the lord the same time of the spoil which they had brought seven hundred oxen and seven thousand sheep
2chr1512 and they entered into a covenant to seek the lord god of their fathers with all their heart and with all their soul
2chr1513 that whosoever would not seek the lord god of israel should be put to death whether small or great whether man or woman
2chr1514 and they sware unto the lord with a loud voice and with shouting and with trumpets and with cornets
2chr1515 and all judah rejoiced at the oath for they had sworn with all their heart and sought him with their whole desire and he was found of them and the lord gave them rest round about
2chr1516 and also concerning maachah the mother of asa the king he removed her from being queen because she had made an idol in a grove and asa cut down her idol and stamped it and burnt it at the brook kidron
2chr1517 but the high places were not taken away out of israel nevertheless the heart of asa was perfect all his days
2chr1518 and he brought into the house of god the things that his father had dedicated and that he himself had dedicated silver and gold and vessels
2chr1519 and there was no more war unto the five and thirtieth year of the reign of asa
2chr161 in the six and thirtieth year of the reign of asa baasha king of israel came up against judah and built ramah to the intent that he might let none go out or come in to asa king of judah
2chr162 then asa brought out silver and gold out of the treasures of the house of the lord and of the king's house and sent to benhadad king of syria that dwelt at damascus saying
2chr163 there is a league between me and thee as there was between my father and thy father behold i have sent thee silver and gold go break thy league with baasha king of israel that he may depart from me
2chr164 and benhadad hearkened unto king asa and sent the captains of his armies against the cities of israel and they smote ijon and dan and abelmaim and all the store cities of naphtali
2chr165 and it came to pass when baasha heard it that he left off building of ramah and let his work cease
2chr166 then asa the king took all judah and they carried away the stones of ramah and the timber thereof wherewith baasha was building and he built therewith geba and mizpah
2chr167 and at that time hanani the seer came to asa king of judah and said unto him because thou hast relied on the king of syria and not relied on the lord thy god therefore is the host of the king of syria escaped out of thine hand
2chr168 were not the ethiopians and the lubims a huge host with very many chariots and horsemen yet because thou didst rely on the lord he delivered them into thine hand
2chr169 for the eyes of the lord run to and fro throughout the whole earth to shew himself strong in the behalf of them whose heart is perfect toward him herein thou hast done foolishly therefore from henceforth thou shalt have wars
2chr1610 then asa was wroth with the seer and put him in a prison house for he was in a rage with him because of this thing and asa oppressed some of the people the same time
2chr1611 and behold the acts of asa first and last lo they are written in the book of the kings of judah and israel
2chr1612 and asa in the thirty and ninth year of his reign was diseased in his feet until his disease was exceeding great yet in his disease he sought not to the lord but to the physicians
2chr1613 and asa slept with his fathers and died in the one and fortieth year of his reign
2chr1614 and they buried him in his own sepulchres which he had made for himself in the city of david and laid him in the bed which was filled with sweet odours and divers kinds of spices prepared by the apothecaries art and they made a very great burning for him
2chr171 and jehoshaphat his son reigned in his stead and strengthened himself against israel
2chr172 and he placed forces in all the fenced cities of judah and set garrisons in the land of judah and in the cities of ephraim which asa his father had taken
2chr173 and the lord was with jehoshaphat because he walked in the first ways of his father david and sought not unto baalim
2chr174 but sought to the lord god of his father and walked in his commandments and not after the doings of israel
2chr175 therefore the lord stablished the kingdom in his hand and all judah brought to jehoshaphat presents and he had riches and honour in abundance
2chr176 and his heart was lifted up in the ways of the lord moreover he took away the high places and groves out of judah
2chr177 also in the third year of his reign he sent to his princes even to benhail and to obadiah and to zechariah and to nethaneel and to michaiah to teach in the cities of judah
2chr178 and with them he sent levites even shemaiah and nethaniah and zebadiah and asahel and shemiramoth and jehonathan and adonijah and tobijah and tobadonijah levites and with them elishama and jehoram priests
2chr179 and they taught in judah and had the book of the law of the lord with them and went about throughout all the cities of judah and taught the people
2chr1710 and the fear of the lord fell upon all the kingdoms of the lands that were round about judah so that they made no war against jehoshaphat
2chr1711 also some of the philistines brought jehoshaphat presents and tribute silver and the arabians brought him flocks seven thousand and seven hundred rams and seven thousand and seven hundred he goats
2chr1712 and jehoshaphat waxed great exceedingly and he built in judah castles and cities of store
2chr1713 and he had much business in the cities of judah and the men of war mighty men of valour were in jerusalem
2chr1714 and these are the numbers of them according to the house of their fathers of judah the captains of thousands adnah the chief and with him mighty men of valour three hundred thousand
2chr1715 and next to him was jehohanan the captain and with him two hundred and fourscore thousand
2chr1716 and next him was amasiah the son of zichri who willingly offered himself unto the lord and with him two hundred thousand mighty men of valour
2chr1717 and of benjamin eliada a mighty man of valour and with him armed men with bow and shield two hundred thousand
2chr1718 and next him was jehozabad and with him an hundred and fourscore thousand ready prepared for the war
2chr1719 these waited on the king beside those whom the king put in the fenced cities throughout all judah
2chr181 now jehoshaphat had riches and honour in abundance and joined affinity with ahab
2chr182 and after certain years he went down to ahab to samaria and ahab killed sheep and oxen for him in abundance and for the people that he had with him and persuaded him to go up with him to ramothgilead
2chr183 and ahab king of israel said unto jehoshaphat king of judah wilt thou go with me to ramothgilead and he answered him i am as thou art and my people as thy people and we will be with thee in the war
2chr184 and jehoshaphat said unto the king of israel enquire i pray thee at the word of the lord to day
2chr185 therefore the king of israel gathered together of prophets four hundred men and said unto them shall we go to ramothgilead to battle or shall i forbear and they said go up for god will deliver it into the king's hand
2chr186 but jehoshaphat said is there not here a prophet of the lord besides that we might enquire of him
2chr187 and the king of israel said unto jehoshaphat there is yet one man by whom we may enquire of the lord but i hate him for he never prophesied good unto me but always evil the same is micaiah the son of imla and jehoshaphat said let not the king say so
2chr188 and the king of israel called for one of his officers and said fetch quickly micaiah the son of imla
2chr189 and the king of israel and jehoshaphat king of judah sat either of them on his throne clothed in their robes and they sat in a void place at the entering in of the gate of samaria and all the prophets prophesied before them
2chr1810 and zedekiah the son of chenaanah had made him horns of iron and said thus saith the lord with these thou shalt push syria until they be consumed
2chr1811 and all the prophets prophesied so saying go up to ramothgilead and prosper for the lord shall deliver it into the hand of the king
2chr1812 and the messenger that went to call micaiah spake to him saying behold the words of the prophets declare good to the king with one assent let thy word therefore i pray thee be like one of theirs and speak thou good
2chr1813 and micaiah said as the lord liveth even what my god saith that will i speak
2chr1814 and when he was come to the king the king said unto him micaiah shall we go to ramothgilead to battle or shall i forbear and he said go ye up and prosper and they shall be delivered into your hand
2chr1815 and the king said to him how many times shall i adjure thee that thou say nothing but the truth to me in the name of the lord
2chr1816 then he said i did see all israel scattered upon the mountains as sheep that have no shepherd and the lord said these have no master let them return therefore every man to his house in peace
2chr1817 and the king of israel said to jehoshaphat did i not tell thee that he would not prophesy good unto me but evil
2chr1818 again he said therefore hear the word of the lord i saw the lord sitting upon his throne and all the host of heaven standing on his right hand and on his left
2chr1819 and the lord said who shall entice ahab king of israel that he may go up and fall at ramothgilead and one spake saying after this manner and another saying after that manner
2chr1820 then there came out a spirit and stood before the lord and said i will entice him and the lord said unto him wherewith
2chr1821 and he said i will go out and be a lying spirit in the mouth of all his prophets and the lord said thou shalt entice him and thou shalt also prevail go out and do even so
2chr1822 now therefore behold the lord hath put a lying spirit in the mouth of these thy prophets and the lord hath spoken evil against thee
2chr1823 then zedekiah the son of chenaanah came near and smote micaiah upon the cheek and said which way went the spirit of the lord from me to speak unto thee
2chr1824 and micaiah said behold thou shalt see on that day when thou shalt go into an inner chamber to hide thyself
2chr1825 then the king of israel said take ye micaiah and carry him back to amon the governor of the city and to joash the king's son
2chr1826 and say thus saith the king put this fellow in the prison and feed him with bread of affliction and with water of affliction until i return in peace
2chr1827 and micaiah said if thou certainly return in peace then hath not the lord spoken by me and he said hearken all ye people
2chr1828 so the king of israel and jehoshaphat the king of judah went up to ramothgilead
2chr1829 and the king of israel said unto jehoshaphat i will disguise myself and will go to the battle but put thou on thy robes so the king of israel disguised himself and they went to the battle
2chr1830 now the king of syria had commanded the captains of the chariots that were with him saying fight ye not with small or great save only with the king of israel
2chr1831 and it came to pass when the captains of the chariots saw jehoshaphat that they said it is the king of israel therefore they compassed about him to fight but jehoshaphat cried out and the lord helped him and god moved them to depart from him
2chr1832 for it came to pass that when the captains of the chariots perceived that it was not the king of israel they turned back again from pursuing him
2chr1833 and a certain man drew a bow at a venture and smote the king of israel between the joints of the harness therefore he said to his chariot man turn thine hand that thou mayest carry me out of the host for i am wounded
2chr1834 and the battle increased that day howbeit the king of israel stayed himself up in his chariot against the syrians until the even and about the time of the sun going down he died
2chr191 and jehoshaphat the king of judah returned to his house in peace to jerusalem
2chr192 and jehu the son of hanani the seer went out to meet him and said to king jehoshaphat shouldest thou help the ungodly and love them that hate the lord therefore is wrath upon thee from before the lord
2chr193 nevertheless there are good things found in thee in that thou hast taken away the groves out of the land and hast prepared thine heart to seek god
2chr194 and jehoshaphat dwelt at jerusalem and he went out again through the people from beersheba to mount ephraim and brought them back unto the lord god of their fathers
2chr195 and he set judges in the land throughout all the fenced cities of judah city by city
2chr196 and said to the judges take heed what ye do for ye judge not for man but for the lord who is with you in the judgment
2chr197 wherefore now let the fear of the lord be upon you take heed and do it for there is no iniquity with the lord our god nor respect of persons nor taking of gifts
2chr198 moreover in jerusalem did jehoshaphat set of the levites and of the priests and of the chief of the fathers of israel for the judgment of the lord and for controversies when they returned to jerusalem
2chr199 and he charged them saying thus shall ye do in the fear of the lord faithfully and with a perfect heart
2chr1910 and what cause soever shall come to you of your brethren that dwell in their cities between blood and blood between law and commandment statutes and judgments ye shall even warn them that they trespass not against the lord and so wrath come upon you and upon your brethren this do and ye shall not trespass
2chr1911 and behold amariah the chief priest is over you in all matters of the lord and zebadiah the son of ishmael the ruler of the house of judah for all the king's matters also the levites shall be officers before you deal courageously and the lord shall be with the good
2chr201 it came to pass after this also that the children of moab and the children of ammon and with them other beside the ammonites came against jehoshaphat to battle
2chr202 then there came some that told jehoshaphat saying there cometh a great multitude against thee from beyond the sea on this side syria and behold they be in hazazontamar which is engedi
2chr203 and jehoshaphat feared and set himself to seek the lord and proclaimed a fast throughout all judah
2chr204 and judah gathered themselves together to ask help of the lord even out of all the cities of judah they came to seek the lord
2chr205 and jehoshaphat stood in the congregation of judah and jerusalem in the house of the lord before the new court
2chr206 and said o lord god of our fathers art not thou god in heaven and rulest not thou over all the kingdoms of the heathen and in thine hand is there not power and might so that none is able to withstand thee
2chr207 art not thou our god who didst drive out the inhabitants of this land before thy people israel and gavest it to the seed of abraham thy friend for ever
2chr208 and they dwelt therein and have built thee a sanctuary therein for thy name saying
2chr209 if when evil cometh upon us as the sword judgment or pestilence or famine we stand before this house and in thy presence for thy name is in this house and cry unto thee in our affliction then thou wilt hear and help
2chr2010 and now behold the children of ammon and moab and mount seir whom thou wouldest not let israel invade when they came out of the land of egypt but they turned from them and destroyed them not
