and aaron the priest went up into mount hor at the commandment of the lord and died there in the fortieth year after the children of israel were come out of the land of egypt in the first day of the fifth month
and aaron was an hundred and twenty and three years old when he died in mount hor
and king arad the canaanite which dwelt in the south in the land of canaan heard of the coming of the children of israel
and they departed from mount hor and pitched in zalmonah
and they departed from zalmonah and pitched in punon
and they departed from punon and pitched in oboth
and they departed from oboth and pitched in ijeabarim in the border of moab
and they departed from iim and pitched in dibongad
and they removed from dibongad and encamped in almondiblathaim
and they removed from almondiblathaim and pitched in the mountains of abarim before nebo
and they departed from the mountains of abarim and pitched in the plains of moab by jordan near jericho
and they pitched by jordan from bethjesimoth even unto abelshittim in the plains of moab
and the lord spake unto moses in the plains of moab by jordan near jericho saying
speak unto the children of israel and say unto them when ye are passed over jordan into the land of canaan
then ye shall drive out all the inhabitants of the land from before you and destroy all their pictures and destroy all their molten images and quite pluck down all their high places
and ye shall dispossess the inhabitants of the land and dwell therein for i have given you the land to possess it
and ye shall divide the land by lot for an inheritance among your families and to the more ye shall give the more inheritance and to the fewer ye shall give the less inheritance every man's inheritance shall be in the place where his lot falleth according to the tribes of your fathers ye shall inherit
but if ye will not drive out the inhabitants of the land from before you then it shall come to pass that those which ye let remain of them shall be pricks in your eyes and thorns in your sides and shall vex you in the land wherein ye dwell
moreover it shall come to pass that i shall do unto you as i thought to do unto them
and the lord spake unto moses saying
command the children of israel and say unto them when ye come into the land of canaan this is the land that shall fall unto you for an inheritance even the land of canaan with the coasts thereof
then your south quarter shall be from the wilderness of zin along by the coast of edom and your south border shall be the outmost coast of the salt sea eastward
and your border shall turn from the south to the ascent of akrabbim and pass on to zin and the going forth thereof shall be from the south to kadeshbarnea and shall go on to hazaraddar and pass on to azmon
and the border shall fetch a compass from azmon unto the river of egypt and the goings out of it shall be at the sea
and as for the western border ye shall even have the great sea for a border this shall be your west border
and this shall be your north border from the great sea ye shall point out for you mount hor
from mount hor ye shall point out your border unto the entrance of hamath and the goings forth of the border shall be to zedad
and the border shall go on to ziphron and the goings out of it shall be at hazarenan this shall be your north border
and ye shall point out your east border from hazarenan to shepham
and the coast shall go down from shepham to riblah on the east side of ain and the border shall descend and shall reach unto the side of the sea of chinnereth eastward
and the border shall go down to jordan and the goings out of it shall be at the salt sea this shall be your land with the coasts thereof round about
and moses commanded the children of israel saying this is the land which ye shall inherit by lot which the lord commanded to give unto the nine tribes and to the half tribe
for the tribe of the children of reuben according to the house of their fathers and the tribe of the children of gad according to the house of their fathers have received their inheritance and half the tribe of manasseh have received their inheritance
the two tribes and the half tribe have received their inheritance on this side jordan near jericho eastward toward the sunrising
and the lord spake unto moses saying
these are the names of the men which shall divide the land unto you eleazar the priest and joshua the son of nun
and ye shall take one prince of every tribe to divide the land by inheritance
and the names of the men are these of the tribe of judah caleb the son of jephunneh
and of the tribe of the children of simeon shemuel the son of ammihud
of the tribe of benjamin elidad the son of chislon
and the prince of the tribe of the children of dan bukki the son of jogli
the prince of the children of joseph for the tribe of the children of manasseh hanniel the son of ephod
and the prince of the tribe of the children of ephraim kemuel the son of shiphtan
and the prince of the tribe of the children of zebulun elizaphan the son of parnach
and the prince of the tribe of the children of issachar paltiel the son of azzan
and the prince of the tribe of the children of asher ahihud the son of shelomi
and the prince of the tribe of the children of naphtali pedahel the son of ammihud
these are they whom the lord commanded to divide the inheritance unto the children of israel in the land of canaan
and the lord spake unto moses in the plains of moab by jordan near jericho saying
command the children of israel that they give unto the levites of the inheritance of their possession cities to dwell in and ye shall give also unto the levites suburbs for the cities round about them
and the cities shall they have to dwell in and the suburbs of them shall be for their cattle and for their goods and for all their beasts
and the suburbs of the cities which ye shall give unto the levites shall reach from the wall of the city and outward a thousand cubits round about
and ye shall measure from without the city on the east side two thousand cubits and on the south side two thousand cubits and on the west side two thousand cubits and on the north side two thousand cubits and the city shall be in the midst this shall be to them the suburbs of the cities
and among the cities which ye shall give unto the levites there shall be six cities for refuge which ye shall appoint for the manslayer that he may flee thither and to them ye shall add forty and two cities
so all the cities which ye shall give to the levites shall be forty and eight cities them shall ye give with their suburbs
and the cities which ye shall give shall be of the possession of the children of israel from them that have many ye shall give many but from them that have few ye shall give few every one shall give of his cities unto the levites according to his inheritance which he inheriteth
and the lord spake unto moses saying
speak unto the children of israel and say unto them when ye be come over jordan into the land of canaan
then ye shall appoint you cities to be cities of refuge for you that the slayer may flee thither which killeth any person at unawares
and they shall be unto you cities for refuge from the avenger that the manslayer die not until he stand before the congregation in judgment
and of these cities which ye shall give six cities shall ye have for refuge
ye shall give three cities on this side jordan and three cities shall ye give in the land of canaan which shall be cities of refuge
these six cities shall be a refuge both for the children of israel and for the stranger and for the sojourner among them that every one that killeth any person unawares may flee thither
and if he smite him with an instrument of iron so that he die he is a murderer the murderer shall surely be put to death
and if he smite him with throwing a stone wherewith he may die and he die he is a murderer the murderer shall surely be put to death
or if he smite him with an hand weapon of wood wherewith he may die and he die he is a murderer the murderer shall surely be put to death
the revenger of blood himself shall slay the murderer when he meeteth him he shall slay him
but if he thrust him of hatred or hurl at him by laying of wait that he die
or in enmity smite him with his hand that he die he that smote him shall surely be put to death for he is a murderer the revenger of blood shall slay the murderer when he meeteth him
but if he thrust him suddenly without enmity or have cast upon him any thing without laying of wait
or with any stone wherewith a man may die seeing him not and cast it upon him that he die and was not his enemy neither sought his harm
then the congregation shall judge between the slayer and the revenger of blood according to these judgments
and the congregation shall deliver the slayer out of the hand of the revenger of blood and the congregation shall restore him to the city of his refuge whither he was fled and he shall abide in it unto the death of the high priest which was anointed with the holy oil
but if the slayer shall at any time come without the border of the city of his refuge whither he was fled
and the revenger of blood find him without the borders of the city of his refuge and the revenger of blood kill the slayer he shall not be guilty of blood
because he should have remained in the city of his refuge until the death of the high priest but after the death of the high priest the slayer shall return into the land of his possession
so these things shall be for a statute of judgment unto you throughout your generations in all your dwellings
whoso killeth any person the murderer shall be put to death by the mouth of witnesses but one witness shall not testify against any person to cause him to die
moreover ye shall take no satisfaction for the life of a murderer which is guilty of death but he shall be surely put to death
and ye shall take no satisfaction for him that is fled to the city of his refuge that he should come again to dwell in the land until the death of the priest
so ye shall not pollute the land wherein ye are for blood it defileth the land and the land cannot be cleansed of the blood that is shed therein but by the blood of him that shed it
defile not therefore the land which ye shall inhabit wherein i dwell for i the lord dwell among the children of israel
and the chief fathers of the families of the children of gilead the son of machir the son of manasseh of the families of the sons of joseph came near and spake before moses and before the princes the chief fathers of the children of israel
and they said the lord commanded my lord to give the land for an inheritance by lot to the children of israel and my lord was commanded by the lord to give the inheritance of zelophehad our brother unto his daughters
and if they be married to any of the sons of the other tribes of the children of israel then shall their inheritance be taken from the inheritance of our fathers and shall be put to the inheritance of the tribe whereunto they are received so shall it be taken from the lot of our inheritance
and when the jubile of the children of israel shall be then shall their inheritance be put unto the inheritance of the tribe whereunto they are received so shall their inheritance be taken away from the inheritance of the tribe of our fathers
and moses commanded the children of israel according to the word of the lord saying the tribe of the sons of joseph hath said well
this is the thing which the lord doth command concerning the daughters of zelophehad saying let them marry to whom they think best only to the family of the tribe of their father shall they marry
so shall not the inheritance of the children of israel remove from tribe to tribe for every one of the children of israel shall keep himself to the inheritance of the tribe of his fathers
and every daughter that possesseth an inheritance in any tribe of the children of israel shall be wife unto one of the family of the tribe of her father that the children of israel may enjoy every man the inheritance of his fathers
neither shall the inheritance remove from one tribe to another tribe but every one of the tribes of the children of israel shall keep himself to his own inheritance
even as the lord commanded moses so did the daughters of zelophehad
for mahlah tirzah and hoglah and milcah and noah the daughters of zelophehad were married unto their father's brothers sons
and they were married into the families of the sons of manasseh the son of joseph and their inheritance remained in the tribe of the family of their father
these are the commandments and the judgments which the lord commanded by the hand of moses unto the children of israel in the plains of moab by jordan near jericho
these be the words which moses spake unto all israel on this side jordan in the wilderness in the plain over against the red sea between paran and tophel and laban and hazeroth and dizahab
there are eleven days journey from horeb by the way of mount seir unto kadeshbarnea
and it came to pass in the fortieth year in the eleventh month on the first day of the month that moses spake unto the children of israel according unto all that the lord had given him in commandment unto them
after he had slain sihon the king of the amorites which dwelt in heshbon and og the king of bashan which dwelt at astaroth in edrei
on this side jordan in the land of moab began moses to declare this law saying
the lord our god spake unto us in horeb saying ye have dwelt long enough in this mount
turn you and take your journey and go to the mount of the amorites and unto all the places nigh thereunto in the plain in the hills and in the vale and in the south and by the sea side to the land of the canaanites and unto lebanon unto the great river the river euphrates
behold i have set the land before you go in and possess the land which the lord sware unto your fathers abraham isaac and jacob to give unto them and to their seed after them
and i spake unto you at that time saying i am not able to bear you myself alone
the lord your god hath multiplied you and behold ye are this day as the stars of heaven for multitude
the lord god of your fathers make you a thousand times so many more as ye are and bless you as he hath promised you
how can i myself alone bear your cumbrance and your burden and your strife
take you wise men and understanding and known among your tribes and i will make them rulers over you
and ye answered me and said the thing which thou hast spoken is good for us to do
so i took the chief of your tribes wise men and known and made them heads over you captains over thousands and captains over hundreds and captains over fifties and captains over tens and officers among your tribes
and i charged your judges at that time saying hear the causes between your brethren and judge righteously between every man and his brother and the stranger that is with him
ye shall not respect persons in judgment but ye shall hear the small as well as the great ye shall not be afraid of the face of man for the judgment is god's and the cause that is too hard for you bring it unto me and i will hear it
and i commanded you at that time all the things which ye should do
and when we departed from horeb we went through all that great and terrible wilderness which ye saw by the way of the mountain of the amorites as the lord our god commanded us and we came to kadeshbarnea
and i said unto you ye are come unto the mountain of the amorites which the lord our god doth give unto us
behold the lord thy god hath set the land before thee go up and possess it as the lord god of thy fathers hath said unto thee fear not neither be discouraged
and ye came near unto me every one of you and said we will send men before us and they shall search us out the land and bring us word again by what way we must go up and into what cities we shall come
and the saying pleased me well and i took twelve men of you one of a tribe
and they turned and went up into the mountain and came unto the valley of eshcol and searched it out
and they took of the fruit of the land in their hands and brought it down unto us and brought us word again and said it is a good land which the lord our god doth give us
notwithstanding ye would not go up but rebelled against the commandment of the lord your god
and ye murmured in your tents and said because the lord hated us he hath brought us forth out of the land of egypt to deliver us into the hand of the amorites to destroy us
whither shall we go up our brethren have discouraged our heart saying the people is greater and taller than we the cities are great and walled up to heaven and moreover we have seen the sons of the anakims there
then i said unto you dread not neither be afraid of them
the lord your god which goeth before you he shall fight for you according to all that he did for you in egypt before your eyes
and in the wilderness where thou hast seen how that the lord thy god bare thee as a man doth bear his son in all the way that ye went until ye came into this place
yet in this thing ye did not believe the lord your god
who went in the way before you to search you out a place to pitch your tents in in fire by night to shew you by what way ye should go and in a cloud by day
and the lord heard the voice of your words and was wroth and sware saying
surely there shall not one of these men of this evil generation see that good land which i sware to give unto your fathers
save caleb the son of jephunneh he shall see it and to him will i give the land that he hath trodden upon and to his children because he hath wholly followed the lord
also the lord was angry with me for your sakes saying thou also shalt not go in thither
but joshua the son of nun which standeth before thee he shall go in thither encourage him for he shall cause israel to inherit it
moreover your little ones which ye said should be a prey and your children which in that day had no knowledge between good and evil they shall go in thither and unto them will i give it and they shall possess it
but as for you turn you and take your journey into the wilderness by the way of the red sea
then ye answered and said unto me we have sinned against the lord we will go up and fight according to all that the lord our god commanded us and when ye had girded on every man his weapons of war ye were ready to go up into the hill
and the lord said unto me say unto them go not up neither fight for i am not among you lest ye be smitten before your enemies
so i spake unto you and ye would not hear but rebelled against the commandment of the lord and went presumptuously up into the hill
and the amorites which dwelt in that mountain came out against you and chased you as bees do and destroyed you in seir even unto hormah
and ye returned and wept before the lord but the lord would not hearken to your voice nor give ear unto you
so ye abode in kadesh many days according unto the days that ye abode there
then we turned and took our journey into the wilderness by the way of the red sea as the lord spake unto me and we compassed mount seir many days
and the lord spake unto me saying
ye have compassed this mountain long enough turn you northward
and command thou the people saying ye are to pass through the coast of your brethren the children of esau which dwell in seir and they shall be afraid of you take ye good heed unto yourselves therefore
meddle not with them for i will not give you of their land no not so much as a foot breadth because i have given mount seir unto esau for a possession
ye shall buy meat of them for money that ye may eat and ye shall also buy water of them for money that ye may drink
for the lord thy god hath blessed thee in all the works of thy hand he knoweth thy walking through this great wilderness these forty years the lord thy god hath been with thee thou hast lacked nothing
and when we passed by from our brethren the children of esau which dwelt in seir through the way of the plain from elath and from eziongaber we turned and passed by the way of the wilderness of moab
and the lord said unto me distress not the moabites neither contend with them in battle for i will not give thee of their land for a possession because i have given ar unto the children of lot for a possession
the emims dwelt therein in times past a people great and many and tall as the anakims
which also were accounted giants as the anakims but the moabites call them emims
the horims also dwelt in seir beforetime but the children of esau succeeded them when they had destroyed them from before them and dwelt in their stead as israel did unto the land of his possession which the lord gave unto them
now rise up said i and get you over the brook zered and we went over the brook zered
and the space in which we came from kadeshbarnea until we were come over the brook zered was thirty and eight years until all the generation of the men of war were wasted out from among the host as the lord sware unto them
for indeed the hand of the lord was against them to destroy them from among the host until they were consumed
so it came to pass when all the men of war were consumed and dead from among the people
that the lord spake unto me saying
thou art to pass over through ar the coast of moab this day
and when thou comest nigh over against the children of ammon distress them not nor meddle with them for i will not give thee of the land of the children of ammon any possession because i have given it unto the children of lot for a possession
that also was accounted a land of giants giants dwelt therein in old time and the ammonites call them zamzummims
a people great and many and tall as the anakims but the lord destroyed them before them and they succeeded them and dwelt in their stead
as he did to the children of esau which dwelt in seir when he destroyed the horims from before them and they succeeded them and dwelt in their stead even unto this day
and the avims which dwelt in hazerim even unto azzah the caphtorims which came forth out of caphtor destroyed them and dwelt in their stead
rise ye up take your journey and pass over the river arnon behold i have given into thine hand sihon the amorite king of heshbon and his land begin to possess it and contend with him in battle
this day will i begin to put the dread of thee and the fear of thee upon the nations that are under the whole heaven who shall hear report of thee and shall tremble and be in anguish because of thee
and i sent messengers out of the wilderness of kedemoth unto sihon king of heshbon with words of peace saying
let me pass through thy land i will go along by the high way i will neither turn unto the right hand nor to the left
thou shalt sell me meat for money that i may eat and give me water for money that i may drink only i will pass through on my feet
as the children of esau which dwell in seir and the moabites which dwell in ar did unto me until i shall pass over jordan into the land which the lord our god giveth us
but sihon king of heshbon would not let us pass by him for the lord thy god hardened his spirit and made his heart obstinate that he might deliver him into thy hand as appeareth this day
and the lord said unto me behold i have begun to give sihon and his land before thee begin to possess that thou mayest inherit his land
then sihon came out against us he and all his people to fight at jahaz
and the lord our god delivered him before us and we smote him and his sons and all his people
and we took all his cities at that time and utterly destroyed the men and the women and the little ones of every city we left none to remain
only the cattle we took for a prey unto ourselves and the spoil of the cities which we took
from aroer which is by the brink of the river of arnon and from the city that is by the river even unto gilead there was not one city too strong for us the lord our god delivered all unto us
only unto the land of the children of ammon thou camest not nor unto any place of the river jabbok nor unto the cities in the mountains nor unto whatsoever the lord our god forbad us
then we turned and went up the way to bashan and og the king of bashan came out against us he and all his people to battle at edrei
and the lord said unto me fear him not for i will deliver him and all his people and his land into thy hand and thou shalt do unto him as thou didst unto sihon king of the amorites which dwelt at heshbon
so the lord our god delivered into our hands og also the king of bashan and all his people and we smote him until none was left to him remaining
and we took all his cities at that time there was not a city which we took not from them threescore cities all the region of argob the kingdom of og in bashan
all these cities were fenced with high walls gates and bars beside unwalled towns a great many
and we utterly destroyed them as we did unto sihon king of heshbon utterly destroying the men women and children of every city
but all the cattle and the spoil of the cities we took for a prey to ourselves
and we took at that time out of the hand of the two kings of the amorites the land that was on this side jordan from the river of arnon unto mount hermon
which hermon the sidonians call sirion and the amorites call it shenir
all the cities of the plain and all gilead and all bashan unto salchah and edrei cities of the kingdom of og in bashan
for only og king of bashan remained of the remnant of giants behold his bedstead was a bedstead of iron is it not in rabbath of the children of ammon nine cubits was the length thereof and four cubits the breadth of it after the cubit of a man
and this land which we possessed at that time from aroer which is by the river arnon and half mount gilead and the cities thereof gave i unto the reubenites and to the gadites
and the rest of gilead and all bashan being the kingdom of og gave i unto the half tribe of manasseh all the region of argob with all bashan which was called the land of giants
jair the son of manasseh took all the country of argob unto the coasts of geshuri and maachathi and called them after his own name bashanhavothjair unto this day
and i gave gilead unto machir
and unto the reubenites and unto the gadites i gave from gilead even unto the river arnon half the valley and the border even unto the river jabbok which is the border of the children of ammon
the plain also and jordan and the coast thereof from chinnereth even unto the sea of the plain even the salt sea under ashdothpisgah eastward
and i commanded you at that time saying the lord your god hath given you this land to possess it ye shall pass over armed before your brethren the children of israel all that are meet for the war
but your wives and your little ones and your cattle for i know that ye have much cattle shall abide in your cities which i have given you
until the lord have given rest unto your brethren as well as unto you and until they also possess the land which the lord your god hath given them beyond jordan and then shall ye return every man unto his possession which i have given you
and i commanded joshua at that time saying thine eyes have seen all that the lord your god hath done unto these two kings so shall the lord do unto all the kingdoms whither thou passest
ye shall not fear them for the lord your god he shall fight for you
