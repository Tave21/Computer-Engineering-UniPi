1ki1314 and went after the man of god and found him sitting under an oak and he said unto him art thou the man of god that camest from judah and he said i am
1ki1315 then he said unto him come home with me and eat bread
1ki1316 and he said i may not return with thee nor go in with thee neither will i eat bread nor drink water with thee in this place
1ki1317 for it was said to me by the word of the lord thou shalt eat no bread nor drink water there nor turn again to go by the way that thou camest
1ki1318 he said unto him i am a prophet also as thou art and an angel spake unto me by the word of the lord saying bring him back with thee into thine house that he may eat bread and drink water but he lied unto him
1ki1319 so he went back with him and did eat bread in his house and drank water
1ki1320 and it came to pass as they sat at the table that the word of the lord came unto the prophet that brought him back
1ki1321 and he cried unto the man of god that came from judah saying thus saith the lord forasmuch as thou hast disobeyed the mouth of the lord and hast not kept the commandment which the lord thy god commanded thee
1ki1322 but camest back and hast eaten bread and drunk water in the place of the which the lord did say to thee eat no bread and drink no water thy carcase shall not come unto the sepulchre of thy fathers
1ki1323 and it came to pass after he had eaten bread and after he had drunk that he saddled for him the ass to wit for the prophet whom he had brought back
1ki1324 and when he was gone a lion met him by the way and slew him and his carcase was cast in the way and the ass stood by it the lion also stood by the carcase
1ki1325 and behold men passed by and saw the carcase cast in the way and the lion standing by the carcase and they came and told it in the city where the old prophet dwelt
1ki1326 and when the prophet that brought him back from the way heard thereof he said it is the man of god who was disobedient unto the word of the lord therefore the lord hath delivered him unto the lion which hath torn him and slain him according to the word of the lord which he spake unto him
1ki1327 and he spake to his sons saying saddle me the ass and they saddled him
1ki1328 and he went and found his carcase cast in the way and the ass and the lion standing by the carcase the lion had not eaten the carcase nor torn the ass
1ki1329 and the prophet took up the carcase of the man of god and laid it upon the ass and brought it back and the old prophet came to the city to mourn and to bury him
1ki1330 and he laid his carcase in his own grave and they mourned over him saying alas my brother
1ki1331 and it came to pass after he had buried him that he spake to his sons saying when i am dead then bury me in the sepulchre wherein the man of god is buried lay my bones beside his bones
1ki1332 for the saying which he cried by the word of the lord against the altar in bethel and against all the houses of the high places which are in the cities of samaria shall surely come to pass
1ki1333 after this thing jeroboam returned not from his evil way but made again of the lowest of the people priests of the high places whosoever would he consecrated him and he became one of the priests of the high places
1ki1334 and this thing became sin unto the house of jeroboam even to cut it off and to destroy it from off the face of the earth
1ki141 at that time abijah the son of jeroboam fell sick
1ki142 and jeroboam said to his wife arise i pray thee and disguise thyself that thou be not known to be the wife of jeroboam and get thee to shiloh behold there is ahijah the prophet which told me that i should be king over this people
1ki143 and take with thee ten loaves and cracknels and a cruse of honey and go to him he shall tell thee what shall become of the child
1ki144 and jeroboam's wife did so and arose and went to shiloh and came to the house of ahijah but ahijah could not see for his eyes were set by reason of his age
1ki145 and the lord said unto ahijah behold the wife of jeroboam cometh to ask a thing of thee for her son for he is sick thus and thus shalt thou say unto her for it shall be when she cometh in that she shall feign herself to be another woman
1ki146 and it was so when ahijah heard the sound of her feet as she came in at the door that he said come in thou wife of jeroboam why feignest thou thyself to be another for i am sent to thee with heavy tidings
1ki147 go tell jeroboam thus saith the lord god of israel forasmuch as i exalted thee from among the people and made thee prince over my people israel
1ki148 and rent the kingdom away from the house of david and gave it thee and yet thou hast not been as my servant david who kept my commandments and who followed me with all his heart to do that only which was right in mine eyes
1ki149 but hast done evil above all that were before thee for thou hast gone and made thee other gods and molten images to provoke me to anger and hast cast me behind thy back
1ki1410 therefore behold i will bring evil upon the house of jeroboam and will cut off from jeroboam him that pisseth against the wall and him that is shut up and left in israel and will take away the remnant of the house of jeroboam as a man taketh away dung till it be all gone
1ki1411 him that dieth of jeroboam in the city shall the dogs eat and him that dieth in the field shall the fowls of the air eat for the lord hath spoken it
1ki1412 arise thou therefore get thee to thine own house and when thy feet enter into the city the child shall die
1ki1413 and all israel shall mourn for him and bury him for he only of jeroboam shall come to the grave because in him there is found some good thing toward the lord god of israel in the house of jeroboam
1ki1414 moreover the lord shall raise him up a king over israel who shall cut off the house of jeroboam that day but what even now
1ki1415 for the lord shall smite israel as a reed is shaken in the water and he shall root up israel out of this good land which he gave to their fathers and shall scatter them beyond the river because they have made their groves provoking the lord to anger
1ki1416 and he shall give israel up because of the sins of jeroboam who did sin and who made israel to sin
1ki1417 and jeroboam's wife arose and departed and came to tirzah and when she came to the threshold of the door the child died
1ki1418 and they buried him and all israel mourned for him according to the word of the lord which he spake by the hand of his servant ahijah the prophet
1ki1419 and the rest of the acts of jeroboam how he warred and how he reigned behold they are written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of israel
1ki1420 and the days which jeroboam reigned were two and twenty years and he slept with his fathers and nadab his son reigned in his stead
1ki1421 and rehoboam the son of solomon reigned in judah rehoboam was forty and one years old when he began to reign and he reigned seventeen years in jerusalem the city which the lord did choose out of all the tribes of israel to put his name there and his mother's name was naamah an ammonitess
1ki1422 and judah did evil in the sight of the lord and they provoked him to jealousy with their sins which they had committed above all that their fathers had done
1ki1423 for they also built them high places and images and groves on every high hill and under every green tree
1ki1424 and there were also sodomites in the land and they did according to all the abominations of the nations which the lord cast out before the children of israel
1ki1425 and it came to pass in the fifth year of king rehoboam that shishak king of egypt came up against jerusalem
1ki1426 and he took away the treasures of the house of the lord and the treasures of the king's house he even took away all and he took away all the shields of gold which solomon had made
1ki1427 and king rehoboam made in their stead brasen shields and committed them unto the hands of the chief of the guard which kept the door of the king's house
1ki1428 and it was so when the king went into the house of the lord that the guard bare them and brought them back into the guard chamber
1ki1429 now the rest of the acts of rehoboam and all that he did are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of judah
1ki1430 and there was war between rehoboam and jeroboam all their days
1ki1431 and rehoboam slept with his fathers and was buried with his fathers in the city of david and his mother's name was naamah an ammonitess and abijam his son reigned in his stead
1ki151 now in the eighteenth year of king jeroboam the son of nebat reigned abijam over judah
1ki152 three years reigned he in jerusalem and his mother's name was maachah the daughter of abishalom
1ki153 and he walked in all the sins of his father which he had done before him and his heart was not perfect with the lord his god as the heart of david his father
1ki154 nevertheless for david's sake did the lord his god give him a lamp in jerusalem to set up his son after him and to establish jerusalem
1ki155 because david did that which was right in the eyes of the lord and turned not aside from any thing that he commanded him all the days of his life save only in the matter of uriah the hittite
1ki156 and there was war between rehoboam and jeroboam all the days of his life
1ki157 now the rest of the acts of abijam and all that he did are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of judah and there was war between abijam and jeroboam
1ki158 and abijam slept with his fathers and they buried him in the city of david and asa his son reigned in his stead
1ki159 and in the twentieth year of jeroboam king of israel reigned asa over judah
1ki1510 and forty and one years reigned he in jerusalem and his mother's name was maachah the daughter of abishalom
1ki1511 and asa did that which was right in the eyes of the lord as did david his father
1ki1512 and he took away the sodomites out of the land and removed all the idols that his fathers had made
1ki1513 and also maachah his mother even her he removed from being queen because she had made an idol in a grove and asa destroyed her idol and burnt it by the brook kidron
1ki1514 but the high places were not removed nevertheless asa's heart was perfect with the lord all his days
1ki1515 and he brought in the things which his father had dedicated and the things which himself had dedicated into the house of the lord silver and gold and vessels
1ki1516 and there was war between asa and baasha king of israel all their days
1ki1517 and baasha king of israel went up against judah and built ramah that he might not suffer any to go out or come in to asa king of judah
1ki1518 then asa took all the silver and the gold that were left in the treasures of the house of the lord and the treasures of the king's house and delivered them into the hand of his servants and king asa sent them to benhadad the son of tabrimon the son of hezion king of syria that dwelt at damascus saying
1ki1519 there is a league between me and thee and between my father and thy father behold i have sent unto thee a present of silver and gold come and break thy league with baasha king of israel that he may depart from me
1ki1520 so benhadad hearkened unto king asa and sent the captains of the hosts which he had against the cities of israel and smote ijon and dan and abelbethmaachah and all cinneroth with all the land of naphtali
1ki1521 and it came to pass when baasha heard thereof that he left off building of ramah and dwelt in tirzah
1ki1522 then king asa made a proclamation throughout all judah none was exempted and they took away the stones of ramah and the timber thereof wherewith baasha had builded and king asa built with them geba of benjamin and mizpah
1ki1523 the rest of all the acts of asa and all his might and all that he did and the cities which he built are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of judah nevertheless in the time of his old age he was diseased in his feet
1ki1524 and asa slept with his fathers and was buried with his fathers in the city of david his father and jehoshaphat his son reigned in his stead
1ki1525 and nadab the son of jeroboam began to reign over israel in the second year of asa king of judah and reigned over israel two years
1ki1526 and he did evil in the sight of the lord and walked in the way of his father and in his sin wherewith he made israel to sin
1ki1527 and baasha the son of ahijah of the house of issachar conspired against him and baasha smote him at gibbethon which belonged to the philistines for nadab and all israel laid siege to gibbethon
1ki1528 even in the third year of asa king of judah did baasha slay him and reigned in his stead
1ki1529 and it came to pass when he reigned that he smote all the house of jeroboam he left not to jeroboam any that breathed until he had destroyed him according unto the saying of the lord which he spake by his servant ahijah the shilonite
1ki1530 because of the sins of jeroboam which he sinned and which he made israel sin by his provocation wherewith he provoked the lord god of israel to anger
1ki1531 now the rest of the acts of nadab and all that he did are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of israel
1ki1532 and there was war between asa and baasha king of israel all their days
1ki1533 in the third year of asa king of judah began baasha the son of ahijah to reign over all israel in tirzah twenty and four years
1ki1534 and he did evil in the sight of the lord and walked in the way of jeroboam and in his sin wherewith he made israel to sin
1ki161 then the word of the lord came to jehu the son of hanani against baasha saying
1ki162 forasmuch as i exalted thee out of the dust and made thee prince over my people israel and thou hast walked in the way of jeroboam and hast made my people israel to sin to provoke me to anger with their sins
1ki163 behold i will take away the posterity of baasha and the posterity of his house and will make thy house like the house of jeroboam the son of nebat
1ki164 him that dieth of baasha in the city shall the dogs eat and him that dieth of his in the fields shall the fowls of the air eat
1ki165 now the rest of the acts of baasha and what he did and his might are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of israel
1ki166 so baasha slept with his fathers and was buried in tirzah and elah his son reigned in his stead
1ki167 and also by the hand of the prophet jehu the son of hanani came the word of the lord against baasha and against his house even for all the evil that he did in the sight of the lord in provoking him to anger with the work of his hands in being like the house of jeroboam and because he killed him
1ki168 in the twenty and sixth year of asa king of judah began elah the son of baasha to reign over israel in tirzah two years
1ki169 and his servant zimri captain of half his chariots conspired against him as he was in tirzah drinking himself drunk in the house of arza steward of his house in tirzah
1ki1610 and zimri went in and smote him and killed him in the twenty and seventh year of asa king of judah and reigned in his stead
1ki1611 and it came to pass when he began to reign as soon as he sat on his throne that he slew all the house of baasha he left him not one that pisseth against a wall neither of his kinsfolks nor of his friends
1ki1612 thus did zimri destroy all the house of baasha according to the word of the lord which he spake against baasha by jehu the prophet
1ki1613 for all the sins of baasha and the sins of elah his son by which they sinned and by which they made israel to sin in provoking the lord god of israel to anger with their vanities
1ki1614 now the rest of the acts of elah and all that he did are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of israel
1ki1615 in the twenty and seventh year of asa king of judah did zimri reign seven days in tirzah and the people were encamped against gibbethon which belonged to the philistines
1ki1616 and the people that were encamped heard say zimri hath conspired and hath also slain the king wherefore all israel made omri the captain of the host king over israel that day in the camp
1ki1617 and omri went up from gibbethon and all israel with him and they besieged tirzah
1ki1618 and it came to pass when zimri saw that the city was taken that he went into the palace of the king's house and burnt the king's house over him with fire and died
1ki1619 for his sins which he sinned in doing evil in the sight of the lord in walking in the way of jeroboam and in his sin which he did to make israel to sin
1ki1620 now the rest of the acts of zimri and his treason that he wrought are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of israel
1ki1621 then were the people of israel divided into two parts half of the people followed tibni the son of ginath to make him king and half followed omri
1ki1622 but the people that followed omri prevailed against the people that followed tibni the son of ginath so tibni died and omri reigned
1ki1623 in the thirty and first year of asa king of judah began omri to reign over israel twelve years six years reigned he in tirzah
1ki1624 and he bought the hill samaria of shemer for two talents of silver and built on the hill and called the name of the city which he built after the name of shemer owner of the hill samaria
1ki1625 but omri wrought evil in the eyes of the lord and did worse than all that were before him
1ki1626 for he walked in all the way of jeroboam the son of nebat and in his sin wherewith he made israel to sin to provoke the lord god of israel to anger with their vanities
1ki1627 now the rest of the acts of omri which he did and his might that he shewed are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of israel
1ki1628 so omri slept with his fathers and was buried in samaria and ahab his son reigned in his stead
1ki1629 and in the thirty and eighth year of asa king of judah began ahab the son of omri to reign over israel and ahab the son of omri reigned over israel in samaria twenty and two years
1ki1630 and ahab the son of omri did evil in the sight of the lord above all that were before him
1ki1631 and it came to pass as if it had been a light thing for him to walk in the sins of jeroboam the son of nebat that he took to wife jezebel the daughter of ethbaal king of the zidonians and went and served baal and worshipped him
1ki1632 and he reared up an altar for baal in the house of baal which he had built in samaria
1ki1633 and ahab made a grove and ahab did more to provoke the lord god of israel to anger than all the kings of israel that were before him
1ki1634 in his days did hiel the bethelite build jericho he laid the foundation thereof in abiram his firstborn and set up the gates thereof in his youngest son segub according to the word of the lord which he spake by joshua the son of nun
1ki171 and elijah the tishbite who was of the inhabitants of gilead said unto ahab as the lord god of israel liveth before whom i stand there shall not be dew nor rain these years but according to my word
1ki172 and the word of the lord came unto him saying
1ki173 get thee hence and turn thee eastward and hide thyself by the brook cherith that is before jordan
1ki174 and it shall be that thou shalt drink of the brook and i have commanded the ravens to feed thee there
1ki175 so he went and did according unto the word of the lord for he went and dwelt by the brook cherith that is before jordan
1ki176 and the ravens brought him bread and flesh in the morning and bread and flesh in the evening and he drank of the brook
1ki177 and it came to pass after a while that the brook dried up because there had been no rain in the land
1ki178 and the word of the lord came unto him saying
1ki179 arise get thee to zarephath which belongeth to zidon and dwell there behold i have commanded a widow woman there to sustain thee
1ki1710 so he arose and went to zarephath and when he came to the gate of the city behold the widow woman was there gathering of sticks and he called to her and said fetch me i pray thee a little water in a vessel that i may drink
1ki1711 and as she was going to fetch it he called to her and said bring me i pray thee a morsel of bread in thine hand
1ki1712 and she said as the lord thy god liveth i have not a cake but an handful of meal in a barrel and a little oil in a cruse and behold i am gathering two sticks that i may go in and dress it for me and my son that we may eat it and die
1ki1713 and elijah said unto her fear not go and do as thou hast said but make me thereof a little cake first and bring it unto me and after make for thee and for thy son
1ki1714 for thus saith the lord god of israel the barrel of meal shall not waste neither shall the cruse of oil fail until the day that the lord sendeth rain upon the earth
1ki1715 and she went and did according to the saying of elijah and she and he and her house did eat many days
1ki1716 and the barrel of meal wasted not neither did the cruse of oil fail according to the word of the lord which he spake by elijah
1ki1717 and it came to pass after these things that the son of the woman the mistress of the house fell sick and his sickness was so sore that there was no breath left in him
1ki1718 and she said unto elijah what have i to do with thee o thou man of god art thou come unto me to call my sin to remembrance and to slay my son
1ki1719 and he said unto her give me thy son and he took him out of her bosom and carried him up into a loft where he abode and laid him upon his own bed
1ki1720 and he cried unto the lord and said o lord my god hast thou also brought evil upon the widow with whom i sojourn by slaying her son
1ki1721 and he stretched himself upon the child three times and cried unto the lord and said o lord my god i pray thee let this child's soul come into him again
1ki1722 and the lord heard the voice of elijah and the soul of the child came into him again and he revived
1ki1723 and elijah took the child and brought him down out of the chamber into the house and delivered him unto his mother and elijah said see thy son liveth
1ki1724 and the woman said to elijah now by this i know that thou art a man of god and that the word of the lord in thy mouth is truth
1ki181 and it came to pass after many days that the word of the lord came to elijah in the third year saying go shew thyself unto ahab and i will send rain upon the earth
1ki182 and elijah went to shew himself unto ahab and there was a sore famine in samaria
1ki183 and ahab called obadiah which was the governor of his house now obadiah feared the lord greatly
1ki184 for it was so when jezebel cut off the prophets of the lord that obadiah took an hundred prophets and hid them by fifty in a cave and fed them with bread and water
1ki185 and ahab said unto obadiah go into the land unto all fountains of water and unto all brooks peradventure we may find grass to save the horses and mules alive that we lose not all the beasts
1ki186 so they divided the land between them to pass throughout it ahab went one way by himself and obadiah went another way by himself
1ki187 and as obadiah was in the way behold elijah met him and he knew him and fell on his face and said art thou that my lord elijah
1ki188 and he answered him i am go tell thy lord behold elijah is here
1ki189 and he said what have i sinned that thou wouldest deliver thy servant into the hand of ahab to slay me
1ki1810 as the lord thy god liveth there is no nation or kingdom whither my lord hath not sent to seek thee and when they said he is not there he took an oath of the kingdom and nation that they found thee not
1ki1811 and now thou sayest go tell thy lord behold elijah is here
1ki1812 and it shall come to pass as soon as i am gone from thee that the spirit of the lord shall carry thee whither i know not and so when i come and tell ahab and he cannot find thee he shall slay me but i thy servant fear the lord from my youth
1ki1813 was it not told my lord what i did when jezebel slew the prophets of the lord how i hid an hundred men of the lord's prophets by fifty in a cave and fed them with bread and water
1ki1814 and now thou sayest go tell thy lord behold elijah is here and he shall slay me
1ki1815 and elijah said as the lord of hosts liveth before whom i stand i will surely shew myself unto him to day
1ki1816 so obadiah went to meet ahab and told him and ahab went to meet elijah
1ki1817 and it came to pass when ahab saw elijah that ahab said unto him art thou he that troubleth israel
1ki1818 and he answered i have not troubled israel but thou and thy father's house in that ye have forsaken the commandments of the lord and thou hast followed baalim
1ki1819 now therefore send and gather to me all israel unto mount carmel and the prophets of baal four hundred and fifty and the prophets of the groves four hundred which eat at jezebel's table
1ki1820 so ahab sent unto all the children of israel and gathered the prophets together unto mount carmel
1ki1821 and elijah came unto all the people and said how long halt ye between two opinions if the lord be god follow him but if baal then follow him and the people answered him not a word
1ki1822 then said elijah unto the people i even i only remain a prophet of the lord but baal's prophets are four hundred and fifty men
1ki1823 let them therefore give us two bullocks and let them choose one bullock for themselves and cut it in pieces and lay it on wood and put no fire under and i will dress the other bullock and lay it on wood and put no fire under
1ki1824 and call ye on the name of your gods and i will call on the name of the lord and the god that answereth by fire let him be god and all the people answered and said it is well spoken
1ki1825 and elijah said unto the prophets of baal choose you one bullock for yourselves and dress it first for ye are many and call on the name of your gods but put no fire under
1ki1826 and they took the bullock which was given them and they dressed it and called on the name of baal from morning even until noon saying o baal hear us but there was no voice nor any that answered and they leaped upon the altar which was made
1ki1827 and it came to pass at noon that elijah mocked them and said cry aloud for he is a god either he is talking or he is pursuing or he is in a journey or peradventure he sleepeth and must be awaked
1ki1828 and they cried aloud and cut themselves after their manner with knives and lancets till the blood gushed out upon them
1ki1829 and it came to pass when midday was past and they prophesied until the time of the offering of the evening sacrifice that there was neither voice nor any to answer nor any that regarded
1ki1830 and elijah said unto all the people come near unto me and all the people came near unto him and he repaired the altar of the lord that was broken down
1ki1831 and elijah took twelve stones according to the number of the tribes of the sons of jacob unto whom the word of the lord came saying israel shall be thy name
1ki1832 and with the stones he built an altar in the name of the lord and he made a trench about the altar as great as would contain two measures of seed
1ki1833 and he put the wood in order and cut the bullock in pieces and laid him on the wood and said fill four barrels with water and pour it on the burnt sacrifice and on the wood
1ki1834 and he said do it the second time and they did it the second time and he said do it the third time and they did it the third time
1ki1835 and the water ran round about the altar and he filled the trench also with water
1ki1836 and it came to pass at the time of the offering of the evening sacrifice that elijah the prophet came near and said lord god of abraham isaac and of israel let it be known this day that thou art god in israel and that i am thy servant and that i have done all these things at thy word
1ki1837 hear me o lord hear me that this people may know that thou art the lord god and that thou hast turned their heart back again
1ki1838 then the fire of the lord fell and consumed the burnt sacrifice and the wood and the stones and the dust and licked up the water that was in the trench
1ki1839 and when all the people saw it they fell on their faces and they said the lord he is the god the lord he is the god
1ki1840 and elijah said unto them take the prophets of baal let not one of them escape and they took them and elijah brought them down to the brook kishon and slew them there
1ki1841 and elijah said unto ahab get thee up eat and drink for there is a sound of abundance of rain
1ki1842 so ahab went up to eat and to drink and elijah went up to the top of carmel and he cast himself down upon the earth and put his face between his knees
1ki1843 and said to his servant go up now look toward the sea and he went up and looked and said there is nothing and he said go again seven times
1ki1844 and it came to pass at the seventh time that he said behold there ariseth a little cloud out of the sea like a man's hand and he said go up say unto ahab prepare thy chariot and get thee down that the rain stop thee not
1ki1845 and it came to pass in the mean while that the heaven was black with clouds and wind and there was a great rain and ahab rode and went to jezreel
1ki1846 and the hand of the lord was on elijah and he girded up his loins and ran before ahab to the entrance of jezreel
1ki191 and ahab told jezebel all that elijah had done and withal how he had slain all the prophets with the sword
1ki192 then jezebel sent a messenger unto elijah saying so let the gods do to me and more also if i make not thy life as the life of one of them by to morrow about this time
1ki193 and when he saw that he arose and went for his life and came to beersheba which belongeth to judah and left his servant there
1ki194 but he himself went a day's journey into the wilderness and came and sat down under a juniper tree and he requested for himself that he might die and said it is enough now o lord take away my life for i am not better than my fathers
1ki195 and as he lay and slept under a juniper tree behold then an angel touched him and said unto him arise and eat
1ki196 and he looked and behold there was a cake baken on the coals and a cruse of water at his head and he did eat and drink and laid him down again
1ki197 and the angel of the lord came again the second time and touched him and said arise and eat because the journey is too great for thee
1ki198 and he arose and did eat and drink and went in the strength of that meat forty days and forty nights unto horeb the mount of god
1ki199 and he came thither unto a cave and lodged there and behold the word of the lord came to him and he said unto him what doest thou here elijah
1ki1910 and he said i have been very jealous for the lord god of hosts for the children of israel have forsaken thy covenant thrown down thine altars and slain thy prophets with the sword and i even i only am left and they seek my life to take it away
