upon that blessed wood whose motion sounds
with thy sweet fingers when thou gently sway'st
the wiry concord that mine ear confounds
do i envy those jacks that nimble leap
to kiss the tender inward of thy hand
whilst my poor lips which should that harvest reap
at the wood's boldness by thee blushing stand
to be so tickled they would change their state
and situation with those dancing chips
o'er whom thy fingers walk with gentle gait
making dead wood more blest than living lips
 since saucy jacks so happy are in this
 give them thy fingers me thy lips to kiss
cxxix
the expense of spirit in a waste of shame
is lust in action and till action lust
is perjured murderous bloody full of blame
savage extreme rude cruel not to trust
enjoy'd no sooner but despised straight
past reason hunted and no sooner had
past reason hated as a swallow'd bait
on purpose laid to make the taker mad
mad in pursuit and in possession so
had having and in quest to have extreme
a bliss in proof and proved a very woe
before a joy proposed behind a dream
 all this the world well knows yet none knows well
 to shun the heaven that leads men to this hell
cxxx
my mistress eyes are nothing like the sun
coral is far more red than her lips red
if snow be white why then her breasts are dun
if hairs be wires black wires grow on her head
i have seen roses damask'd red and white
but no such roses see i in her cheeks
and in some perfumes is there more delight
than in the breath that from my mistress reeks
i love to hear her speak yet well i know
that music hath a far more pleasing sound
i grant i never saw a goddess go
my mistress when she walks treads on the ground
 and yet by heaven i think my love as rare
 as any she belied with false compare
cxxxi
thou art as tyrannous so as thou art
as those whose beauties proudly make them cruel
for well thou know'st to my dear doting heart
thou art the fairest and most precious jewel
yet in good faith some say that thee behold
thy face hath not the power to make love groan
to say they err i dare not be so bold
although i swear it to myself alone
and to be sure that is not false i swear
a thousand groans but thinking on thy face
one on another's neck do witness bear
thy black is fairest in my judgment's place
 in nothing art thou black save in thy deeds
 and thence this slander as i think proceeds
cxxxii
thine eyes i love and they as pitying me
knowing thy heart torments me with disdain
have put on black and loving mourners be
looking with pretty ruth upon my pain
and truly not the morning sun of heaven
better becomes the grey cheeks of the east
nor that full star that ushers in the even
doth half that glory to the sober west
as those two mourning eyes become thy face
o let it then as well beseem thy heart
to mourn for me since mourning doth thee grace
and suit thy pity like in every part
 then will i swear beauty herself is black
 and all they foul that thy complexion lack
cxxxiii
beshrew that heart that makes my heart to groan
for that deep wound it gives my friend and me
is't not enough to torture me alone
but slave to slavery my sweet'st friend must be
me from myself thy cruel eye hath taken
and my next self thou harder hast engross'd
of him myself and thee i am forsaken
a torment thrice threefold thus to be cross'd
prison my heart in thy steel bosom's ward
but then my friend's heart let my poor heart bail
whoe'er keeps me let my heart be his guard
thou canst not then use rigor in my gaol
 and yet thou wilt for i being pent in thee
 perforce am thine and all that is in me
cxxxiv
so now i have confess'd that he is thine
and i myself am mortgaged to thy will
myself i'll forfeit so that other mine
thou wilt restore to be my comfort still
but thou wilt not nor he will not be free
for thou art covetous and he is kind
he learn'd but suretylike to write for me
under that bond that him as fast doth bind
the statute of thy beauty thou wilt take
thou usurer that put'st forth all to use
and sue a friend came debtor for my sake
so him i lose through my unkind abuse
 him have i lost thou hast both him and me
 he pays the whole and yet am i not free
cxxxv
whoever hath her wish thou hast thy will'
and will to boot and will in overplus
more than enough am i that vex thee still
to thy sweet will making addition thus
wilt thou whose will is large and spacious
not once vouchsafe to hide my will in thine
shall will in others seem right gracious
and in my will no fair acceptance shine
the sea all water yet receives rain still
and in abundance addeth to his store
so thou being rich in will add to thy will'
one will of mine to make thy large will more
 let no unkind no fair beseechers kill
 think all but one and me in that one will'
cxxxvi
if thy soul cheque thee that i come so near
swear to thy blind soul that i was thy will'
and will thy soul knows is admitted there
thus far for love my lovesuit sweet fulfil
'will will fulfil the treasure of thy love
ay fill it full with wills and my will one
in things of great receipt with ease we prove
among a number one is reckon'd none
then in the number let me pass untold
though in thy stores account i one must be
for nothing hold me so it please thee hold
that nothing me a something sweet to thee
 make but my name thy love and love that still
 and then thou lovest me for my name is will'
cxxxvii
thou blind fool love what dost thou to mine eyes
that they behold and see not what they see
they know what beauty is see where it lies
yet what the best is take the worst to be
if eyes corrupt by overpartial looks
be anchor'd in the bay where all men ride
why of eyes falsehood hast thou forged hooks
whereto the judgment of my heart is tied
why should my heart think that a several plot
which my heart knows the wide world's common place
or mine eyes seeing this say this is not
to put fair truth upon so foul a face
 in things right true my heart and eyes have erred
 and to this false plague are they now transferr'd
cxxxviii
when my love swears that she is made of truth
i do believe her though i know she lies
that she might think me some untutor'd youth
unlearned in the world's false subtleties
thus vainly thinking that she thinks me young
although she knows my days are past the best
simply i credit her false speaking tongue
on both sides thus is simple truth suppress'd
but wherefore says she not she is unjust
and wherefore say not i that i am old
o love's best habit is in seeming trust
and age in love loves not to have years told
 therefore i lie with her and she with me
 and in our faults by lies we flatter'd be
cxxxix
o call not me to justify the wrong
that thy unkindness lays upon my heart
wound me not with thine eye but with thy tongue
use power with power and slay me not by art
tell me thou lovest elsewhere but in my sight
dear heart forbear to glance thine eye aside
what need'st thou wound with cunning when thy might
is more than my o'erpress'd defense can bide
let me excuse thee ah my love well knows
her pretty looks have been mine enemies
and therefore from my face she turns my foes
that they elsewhere might dart their injuries
 yet do not so but since i am near slain
 kill me outright with looks and rid my pain
cxl
be wise as thou art cruel do not press
my tonguetied patience with too much disdain
lest sorrow lend me words and words express
the manner of my pitywanting pain
if i might teach thee wit better it were
though not to love yet love to tell me so
as testy sick men when their deaths be near
no news but health from their physicians know
for if i should despair i should grow mad
and in my madness might speak ill of thee
now this illwresting world is grown so bad
mad slanderers by mad ears believed be
 that i may not be so nor thou belied
 bear thine eyes straight though thy proud heart go wide
cxli
in faith i do not love thee with mine eyes
for they in thee a thousand errors note
but tis my heart that loves what they despise
who in despite of view is pleased to dote
nor are mine ears with thy tongue's tune delighted
nor tender feeling to base touches prone
