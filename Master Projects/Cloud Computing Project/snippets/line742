 by heaven i think my sword's as sharp as yours
 i would not have you lord forget yourself
 nor tempt the danger of my true defence
 lest i by marking of your rage forget
 your worth your greatness and nobility
bigot out dunghill darest thou brave a nobleman
hubert not for my life but yet i dare defend
 my innocent life against an emperor
salisbury thou art a murderer
hubert do not prove me so
 yet i am none whose tongue soe'er speaks false
 not truly speaks who speaks not truly lies
pembroke cut him to pieces
bastard keep the peace i say
salisbury stand by or i shall gall you faulconbridge
bastard thou wert better gall the devil salisbury
 if thou but frown on me or stir thy foot
 or teach thy hasty spleen to do me shame
 i'll strike thee dead put up thy sword betime
 or i'll so maul you and your toastingiron
 that you shall think the devil is come from hell
bigot what wilt thou do renowned faulconbridge
 second a villain and a murderer
hubert lord bigot i am none
bigot who kill'd this prince
hubert tis not an hour since i left him well
 i honour'd him i loved him and will weep
 my date of life out for his sweet life's loss
salisbury trust not those cunning waters of his eyes
 for villany is not without such rheum
 and he long traded in it makes it seem
 like rivers of remorse and innocency
 away with me all you whose souls abhor
 the uncleanly savours of a slaughterhouse
 for i am stifled with this smell of sin
bigot away toward bury to the dauphin there
pembroke there tell the king he may inquire us out
 exeunt lords
bastard here's a good world knew you of this fair work
 beyond the infinite and boundless reach
 of mercy if thou didst this deed of death
 art thou damn'd hubert
hubert do but hear me sir
bastard ha i'll tell thee what
 thou'rt damn'd as blacknay nothing is so black
 thou art more deep damn'd than prince lucifer
 there is not yet so ugly a fiend of hell
 as thou shalt be if thou didst kill this child
hubert upon my soul
bastard if thou didst but consent
 to this most cruel act do but despair
 and if thou want'st a cord the smallest thread
 that ever spider twisted from her womb
 will serve to strangle thee a rush will be a beam
 to hang thee on or wouldst thou drown thyself
 put but a little water in a spoon
 and it shall be as all the ocean
 enough to stifle such a villain up
 i do suspect thee very grievously
hubert if i in act consent or sin of thought
 be guilty of the stealing that sweet breath
 which was embounded in this beauteous clay
 let hell want pains enough to torture me
 i left him well
bastard go bear him in thine arms
 i am amazed methinks and lose my way
 among the thorns and dangers of this world
 how easy dost thou take all england up
 from forth this morsel of dead royalty
 the life the right and truth of all this realm
 is fled to heaven and england now is left
 to tug and scamble and to part by the teeth
 the unowed interest of proudswelling state
 now for the barepick'd bone of majesty
 doth dogged war bristle his angry crest
 and snarleth in the gentle eyes of peace
 now powers from home and discontents at home
 meet in one line and vast confusion waits
 as doth a raven on a sickfall'n beast
 the imminent decay of wrested pomp
 now happy he whose cloak and cincture can
 hold out this tempest bear away that child
 and follow me with speed i'll to the king
 a thousand businesses are brief in hand
 and heaven itself doth frown upon the land

act v
scene i king john's palace
 enter king john cardinal pandulph and attendants
king john thus have i yielded up into your hand
 the circle of my glory
 giving the crown
cardinal pandulph take again
 from this my hand as holding of the pope
 your sovereign greatness and authority
king john now keep your holy word go meet the french
 and from his holiness use all your power
 to stop their marches fore we are inflamed
 our discontented counties do revolt
 our people quarrel with obedience
 swearing allegiance and the love of soul
 to stranger blood to foreign royalty
 this inundation of mistemper'd humour
 rests by you only to be qualified
 then pause not for the present time's so sick
 that present medicine must be minister'd
 or overthrow incurable ensues
cardinal pandulph it was my breath that blew this tempest up
 upon your stubborn usage of the pope
 but since you are a gentle convertite
 my tongue shall hush again this storm of war
 and make fair weather in your blustering land
 on this ascensionday remember well
 upon your oath of service to the pope
 go i to make the french lay down their arms
 exit
king john is this ascensionday did not the prophet
 say that before ascensionday at noon
 my crown i should give off even so i have
 i did suppose it should be on constraint
 but heaven be thank'd it is but voluntary
 enter the bastard
bastard all kent hath yielded nothing there holds out
 but dover castle london hath received
 like a kind host the dauphin and his powers
 your nobles will not hear you but are gone
 to offer service to your enemy
 and wild amazement hurries up and down
 the little number of your doubtful friends
king john would not my lords return to me again
 after they heard young arthur was alive
bastard they found him dead and cast into the streets
 an empty casket where the jewel of life
 by some damn'd hand was robb'd and ta'en away
king john that villain hubert told me he did live
bastard so on my soul he did for aught he knew
 but wherefore do you droop why look you sad
 be great in act as you have been in thought
 let not the world see fear and sad distrust
 govern the motion of a kingly eye
 be stirring as the time be fire with fire
 threaten the threatener and outface the brow
 of bragging horror so shall inferior eyes
 that borrow their behaviors from the great
 grow great by your example and put on
 the dauntless spirit of resolution
 away and glister like the god of war
 when he intendeth to become the field
 show boldness and aspiring confidence
 what shall they seek the lion in his den
 and fright him there and make him tremble there
 o let it not be said forage and run
 to meet displeasure farther from the doors
 and grapple with him ere he comes so nigh
king john the legate of the pope hath been with me
 and i have made a happy peace with him
 and he hath promised to dismiss the powers
 led by the dauphin
bastard o inglorious league
 shall we upon the footing of our land
 send fairplay orders and make compromise
 insinuation parley and base truce
 to arms invasive shall a beardless boy
 a cocker'd silken wanton brave our fields
 and flesh his spirit in a warlike soil
 mocking the air with colours idly spread
 and find no cheque let us my liege to arms
 perchance the cardinal cannot make your peace
 or if he do let it at least be said
 they saw we had a purpose of defence
king john have thou the ordering of this present time
bastard away then with good courage yet i know
 our party may well meet a prouder foe
 exeunt
 king john
act v
scene ii lewis's camp at st edmundsbury
 enter in arms lewis salisbury melun pembroke
 bigot and soldiers
lewis my lord melun let this be copied out
 and keep it safe for our remembrance
 return the precedent to these lords again
 that having our fair order written down
 both they and we perusing o'er these notes
 may know wherefore we took the sacrament
 and keep our faiths firm and inviolable
salisbury upon our sides it never shall be broken
 and noble dauphin albeit we swear
 a voluntary zeal and an unurged faith
 to your proceedings yet believe me prince
 i am not glad that such a sore of time
 should seek a plaster by contemn'd revolt
 and heal the inveterate canker of one wound
 by making many o it grieves my soul
 that i must draw this metal from my side
 to be a widowmaker o and there
 where honourable rescue and defence
 cries out upon the name of salisbury
 but such is the infection of the time
