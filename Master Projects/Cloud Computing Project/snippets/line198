 now for ourself and for this time of meeting
 thus much the business is we have here writ
 to norway uncle of young fortinbras
 who impotent and bedrid scarcely hears
 of this his nephew's purposeto suppress
 his further gait herein in that the levies
 the lists and full proportions are all made
 out of his subject and we here dispatch
 you good cornelius and you voltimand
 for bearers of this greeting to old norway
 giving to you no further personal power
 to business with the king more than the scope
 of these delated articles allow
 farewell and let your haste commend your duty
cornelius 
 in that and all things will we show our duty
voltimand 
king claudius we doubt it nothing heartily farewell
 exeunt voltimand and cornelius
 and now laertes what's the news with you
 you told us of some suit what is't laertes
 you cannot speak of reason to the dane
 and loose your voice what wouldst thou beg laertes
 that shall not be my offer not thy asking
 the head is not more native to the heart
 the hand more instrumental to the mouth
 than is the throne of denmark to thy father
 what wouldst thou have laertes
laertes my dread lord
 your leave and favour to return to france
 from whence though willingly i came to denmark
 to show my duty in your coronation
 yet now i must confess that duty done
 my thoughts and wishes bend again toward france
 and bow them to your gracious leave and pardon
king claudius have you your father's leave what says polonius
lord polonius he hath my lord wrung from me my slow leave
 by laboursome petition and at last
 upon his will i seal'd my hard consent
 i do beseech you give him leave to go
king claudius take thy fair hour laertes time be thine
 and thy best graces spend it at thy will
 but now my cousin hamlet and my son
hamlet aside a little more than kin and less than kind
king claudius how is it that the clouds still hang on you
hamlet not so my lord i am too much i the sun
queen gertrude good hamlet cast thy nighted colour off
 and let thine eye look like a friend on denmark
 do not for ever with thy vailed lids
 seek for thy noble father in the dust
 thou know'st tis common all that lives must die
 passing through nature to eternity
hamlet ay madam it is common
queen gertrude if it be
 why seems it so particular with thee
hamlet seems madam nay it is i know not seems'
 tis not alone my inky cloak good mother
 nor customary suits of solemn black
 nor windy suspiration of forced breath
 no nor the fruitful river in the eye
 nor the dejected havior of the visage
 together with all forms moods shapes of grief
 that can denote me truly these indeed seem
 for they are actions that a man might play
 but i have that within which passeth show
 these but the trappings and the suits of woe
king claudius tis sweet and commendable in your nature hamlet
 to give these mourning duties to your father
 but you must know your father lost a father
 that father lost lost his and the survivor bound
 in filial obligation for some term
 to do obsequious sorrow but to persever
 in obstinate condolement is a course
 of impious stubbornness tis unmanly grief
 it shows a will most incorrect to heaven
 a heart unfortified a mind impatient
 an understanding simple and unschool'd
 for what we know must be and is as common
 as any the most vulgar thing to sense
 why should we in our peevish opposition
 take it to heart fie tis a fault to heaven
 a fault against the dead a fault to nature
 to reason most absurd whose common theme
 is death of fathers and who still hath cried
 from the first corse till he that died today
 this must be so we pray you throw to earth
 this unprevailing woe and think of us
 as of a father for let the world take note
 you are the most immediate to our throne
 and with no less nobility of love
 than that which dearest father bears his son
 do i impart toward you for your intent
 in going back to school in wittenberg
 it is most retrograde to our desire
 and we beseech you bend you to remain
 here in the cheer and comfort of our eye
 our chiefest courtier cousin and our son
queen gertrude let not thy mother lose her prayers hamlet
 i pray thee stay with us go not to wittenberg
hamlet i shall in all my best obey you madam
king claudius why tis a loving and a fair reply
 be as ourself in denmark madam come
 this gentle and unforced accord of hamlet
 sits smiling to my heart in grace whereof
 no jocund health that denmark drinks today
 but the great cannon to the clouds shall tell
 and the king's rouse the heavens all bruit again
 respeaking earthly thunder come away
 exeunt all but hamlet
hamlet o that this too too solid flesh would melt
 thaw and resolve itself into a dew
 or that the everlasting had not fix'd
 his canon gainst selfslaughter o god god
 how weary stale flat and unprofitable
 seem to me all the uses of this world
 fie on't ah fie tis an unweeded garden
 that grows to seed things rank and gross in nature
 possess it merely that it should come to this
 but two months dead nay not so much not two
 so excellent a king that was to this
 hyperion to a satyr so loving to my mother
 that he might not beteem the winds of heaven
 visit her face too roughly heaven and earth
 must i remember why she would hang on him
 as if increase of appetite had grown
 by what it fed on and yet within a month
 let me not think on'tfrailty thy name is woman
 a little month or ere those shoes were old
 with which she follow'd my poor father's body
 like niobe all tearswhy she even she
 o god a beast that wants discourse of reason
 would have mourn'd longermarried with my uncle
 my father's brother but no more like my father
 than i to hercules within a month
 ere yet the salt of most unrighteous tears
 had left the flushing in her galled eyes
 she married o most wicked speed to post
 with such dexterity to incestuous sheets
 it is not nor it cannot come to good
 but break my heart for i must hold my tongue
 enter horatio marcellus and bernardo
horatio hail to your lordship
hamlet i am glad to see you well
 horatioor i do forget myself
horatio the same my lord and your poor servant ever
hamlet sir my good friend i'll change that name with you
 and what make you from wittenberg horatio marcellus
marcellus my good lord
hamlet i am very glad to see you good even sir
 but what in faith make you from wittenberg
horatio a truant disposition good my lord
hamlet i would not hear your enemy say so
 nor shall you do mine ear that violence
 to make it truster of your own report
 against yourself i know you are no truant
 but what is your affair in elsinore
 we'll teach you to drink deep ere you depart
horatio my lord i came to see your father's funeral
hamlet i pray thee do not mock me fellowstudent
 i think it was to see my mother's wedding
horatio indeed my lord it follow'd hard upon
hamlet thrift thrift horatio the funeral baked meats
 did coldly furnish forth the marriage tables
 would i had met my dearest foe in heaven
 or ever i had seen that day horatio
 my fathermethinks i see my father
horatio where my lord
hamlet in my mind's eye horatio
horatio i saw him once he was a goodly king
hamlet he was a man take him for all in all
 i shall not look upon his like again
horatio my lord i think i saw him yesternight
hamlet saw who
horatio my lord the king your father
hamlet the king my father
horatio season your admiration for awhile
 with an attent ear till i may deliver
 upon the witness of these gentlemen
 this marvel to you
hamlet for god's love let me hear
horatio two nights together had these gentlemen
 marcellus and bernardo on their watch
 in the dead vast and middle of the night
 been thus encounter'd a figure like your father
 armed at point exactly capape
 appears before them and with solemn march
 goes slow and stately by them thrice he walk'd
 by their oppress'd and fearsurprised eyes
 within his truncheon's length whilst they distilled
 almost to jelly with the act of fear
 stand dumb and speak not to him this to me
 in dreadful secrecy impart they did
 and i with them the third night kept the watch
 where as they had deliver'd both in time
 form of the thing each word made true and good
 the apparition comes i knew your father
 these hands are not more like
hamlet but where was this
marcellus my lord upon the platform where we watch'd
hamlet did you not speak to it
