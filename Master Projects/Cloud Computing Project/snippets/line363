 impossible be strange attempts to those
 that weigh their pains in sense and do suppose
 what hath been cannot be who ever strove

scene ii paris the king's palace
 flourish of cornets enter the king of france
 with letters and divers attendants
king the florentines and senoys are by the ears
 have fought with equal fortune and continue
 a braving war
first lord so tis reported sir
king nay tis most credible we here received it
 a certainty vouch'd from our cousin austria
 with caution that the florentine will move us
 for speedy aid wherein our dearest friend
 prejudicates the business and would seem
 to have us make denial
first lord his love and wisdom
 approved so to your majesty may plead
 for amplest credence
king he hath arm'd our answer
 and florence is denied before he comes
 yet for our gentlemen that mean to see
 the tuscan service freely have they leave
 to stand on either part
second lord it well may serve
 a nursery to our gentry who are sick
 for breathing and exploit
king what's he comes here
 enter bertram lafeu and parolles
first lord it is the count rousillon my good lord
 young bertram
king youth thou bear'st thy father's face
 frank nature rather curious than in haste
 hath well composed thee thy father's moral parts
 mayst thou inherit too welcome to paris
bertram my thanks and duty are your majesty's
king i would i had that corporal soundness now
 as when thy father and myself in friendship
 first tried our soldiership he did look far
 into the service of the time and was
 discipled of the bravest he lasted long
 but on us both did haggish age steal on
 and wore us out of act it much repairs me
 to talk of your good father in his youth
 he had the wit which i can well observe
 today in our young lords but they may jest
 till their own scorn return to them unnoted
 ere they can hide their levity in honour
 so like a courtier contempt nor bitterness
 were in his pride or sharpness if they were
 his equal had awaked them and his honour
 clock to itself knew the true minute when
 exception bid him speak and at this time
 his tongue obey'd his hand who were below him
 he used as creatures of another place
 and bow'd his eminent top to their low ranks
 making them proud of his humility
 in their poor praise he humbled such a man
 might be a copy to these younger times
 which follow'd well would demonstrate them now
 but goers backward
bertram his good remembrance sir
 lies richer in your thoughts than on his tomb
 so in approof lives not his epitaph
 as in your royal speech
king would i were with him he would always say
 methinks i hear him now his plausive words
 he scatter'd not in ears but grafted them
 to grow there and to bear'let me not live'
 this his good melancholy oft began
 on the catastrophe and heel of pastime
 when it was out'let me not live quoth he
 after my flame lacks oil to be the snuff
 of younger spirits whose apprehensive senses
 all but new things disdain whose judgments are
 mere fathers of their garments whose constancies
 expire before their fashions this he wish'd
 i after him do after him wish too
 since i nor wax nor honey can bring home
 i quickly were dissolved from my hive
 to give some labourers room
second lord you are loved sir
 they that least lend it you shall lack you first
king i fill a place i know't how long is't count
 since the physician at your father's died
 he was much famed
bertram some six months since my lord
king if he were living i would try him yet
 lend me an arm the rest have worn me out
 with several applications nature and sickness
 debate it at their leisure welcome count
 my son's no dearer
bertram thank your majesty

 of my flesh and blood he that cherishes my flesh
 and blood loves my flesh and blood he that loves my
 flesh and blood is my friend ergo he that kisses

 hurt done though honesty be no puritan yet it
 will do no hurt it will wear the surplice of
 humility over the black gown of a big heart i am

 more owing her than is paid and more shall be paid
