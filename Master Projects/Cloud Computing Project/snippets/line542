 they'll tell the clock to any business that
 we say befits the hour

sebastian whiles we stood here securing your repose
 even now we heard a hollow burst of bellowing
 like bulls or rather lions did't not wake you
 it struck mine ear most terribly
alonso i heard nothing
antonio o twas a din to fright a monster's ear
 to make an earthquake sure it was the roar
 of a whole herd of lions
alonso heard you this gonzalo
gonzalo upon mine honour sir i heard a humming
 and that a strange one too which did awake me
 i shaked you sir and cried as mine eyes open'd
 i saw their weapons drawn there was a noise
 that's verily tis best we stand upon our guard
 or that we quit this place let's draw our weapons

 the tempest
act ii
scene ii another part of the island
 enter caliban with a burden of wood a noise of
 thunder heard
caliban all the infections that the sun sucks up
 from bogs fens flats on prosper fall and make him
 by inchmeal a disease his spirits hear me
 and yet i needs must curse but they'll nor pinch
 fright me with urchinshows pitch me i the mire
 nor lead me like a firebrand in the dark
 out of my way unless he bid em but
 for every trifle are they set upon me
 sometime like apes that mow and chatter at me
 and after bite me then like hedgehogs which
 lie tumbling in my barefoot way and mount
 their pricks at my footfall sometime am i
 all wound with adders who with cloven tongues
 do hiss me into madness
 enter trinculo
 lo now lo
 here comes a spirit of his and to torment me
 for bringing wood in slowly i'll fall flat
 perchance he will not mind me
trinculo here's neither bush nor shrub to bear off
 any weather at all and another storm brewing
 i hear it sing i the wind yond same black
 cloud yond huge one looks like a foul
 bombard that would shed his liquor if it
 should thunder as it did before i know not
 where to hide my head yond same cloud cannot
 choose but fall by pailfuls what have we
 here a man or a fish dead or alive a fish
 he smells like a fish a very ancient and fish
 like smell a kind of not of the newest poor
 john a strange fish were i in england now
 as once i was and had but this fish painted
 not a holiday fool there but would give a piece
 of silver there would this monster make a
 man any strange beast there makes a man
 when they will not give a doit to relieve a lame
 beggar they will lazy out ten to see a dead
 indian legged like a man and his fins like
 arms warm o my troth i do now let loose
 my opinion hold it no longer this is no fish
 but an islander that hath lately suffered by a
 thunderbolt
 thunder
 alas the storm is come again my best way is to
 creep under his gaberdine there is no other
 shelter hereabouts misery acquaints a man with
 strange bedfellows i will here shroud till the
 dregs of the storm be past
 enter stephano singing a bottle in his hand
stephano i shall no more to sea to sea
 here shall i die ashore
 this is a very scurvy tune to sing at a man's
 funeral well here's my comfort drinks
 sings
 the master the swabber the boatswain and i
 the gunner and his mate
 loved mall meg and marian and margery
 but none of us cared for kate
 for she had a tongue with a tang
 would cry to a sailor go hang
 she loved not the savour of tar nor of pitch
 yet a tailor might scratch her where'er she did itch
 then to sea boys and let her go hang
 this is a scurvy tune too but here's my comfort
 drinks

 tricks upon's with savages and men of ind ha i

 present for any emperor that ever trod on neat's leather

 escaped upon a butt of sack which the sailors
 heaved o'erboard by this bottle which i made of
 the bark of a tree with mine own hands since i was
 cast ashore
