for david after he had served his own generation by the will of god fell on sleep and was laid unto his fathers and saw corruption
but he whom god raised again saw no corruption
be it known unto you therefore men and brethren that through this man is preached unto you the forgiveness of sins
and by him all that believe are justified from all things from which ye could not be justified by the law of moses
beware therefore lest that come upon you which is spoken of in the prophets
behold ye despisers and wonder and perish for i work a work in your days a work which ye shall in no wise believe though a man declare it unto you
and when the jews were gone out of the synagogue the gentiles besought that these words might be preached to them the next sabbath
now when the congregation was broken up many of the jews and religious proselytes followed paul and barnabas who speaking to them persuaded them to continue in the grace of god
and the next sabbath day came almost the whole city together to hear the word of god
but when the jews saw the multitudes they were filled with envy and spake against those things which were spoken by paul contradicting and blaspheming
then paul and barnabas waxed bold and said it was necessary that the word of god should first have been spoken to you but seeing ye put it from you and judge yourselves unworthy of everlasting life lo we turn to the gentiles
for so hath the lord commanded us saying i have set thee to be a light of the gentiles that thou shouldest be for salvation unto the ends of the earth
and when the gentiles heard this they were glad and glorified the word of the lord and as many as were ordained to eternal life believed
and the word of the lord was published throughout all the region
but the jews stirred up the devout and honourable women and the chief men of the city and raised persecution against paul and barnabas and expelled them out of their coasts
but they shook off the dust of their feet against them and came unto iconium
and the disciples were filled with joy and with the holy ghost
and it came to pass in iconium that they went both together into the synagogue of the jews and so spake that a great multitude both of the jews and also of the greeks believed
but the unbelieving jews stirred up the gentiles and made their minds evil affected against the brethren
long time therefore abode they speaking boldly in the lord which gave testimony unto the word of his grace and granted signs and wonders to be done by their hands
but the multitude of the city was divided and part held with the jews and part with the apostles
and when there was an assault made both of the gentiles and also of the jews with their rulers to use them despitefully and to stone them
they were ware of it and fled unto lystra and derbe cities of lycaonia and unto the region that lieth round about
and there they preached the gospel
and there sat a certain man at lystra impotent in his feet being a cripple from his mother's womb who never had walked
the same heard paul speak who stedfastly beholding him and perceiving that he had faith to be healed
said with a loud voice stand upright on thy feet and he leaped and walked
and when the people saw what paul had done they lifted up their voices saying in the speech of lycaonia the gods are come down to us in the likeness of men
and they called barnabas jupiter and paul mercurius because he was the chief speaker
then the priest of jupiter which was before their city brought oxen and garlands unto the gates and would have done sacrifice with the people
which when the apostles barnabas and paul heard of they rent their clothes and ran in among the people crying out
and saying sirs why do ye these things we also are men of like passions with you and preach unto you that ye should turn from these vanities unto the living god which made heaven and earth and the sea and all things that are therein
who in times past suffered all nations to walk in their own ways
nevertheless he left not himself without witness in that he did good and gave us rain from heaven and fruitful seasons filling our hearts with food and gladness
and with these sayings scarce restrained they the people that they had not done sacrifice unto them
and there came thither certain jews from antioch and iconium who persuaded the people and having stoned paul drew him out of the city supposing he had been dead
howbeit as the disciples stood round about him he rose up and came into the city and the next day he departed with barnabas to derbe
and when they had preached the gospel to that city and had taught many they returned again to lystra and to iconium and antioch
confirming the souls of the disciples and exhorting them to continue in the faith and that we must through much tribulation enter into the kingdom of god
and when they had ordained them elders in every church and had prayed with fasting they commended them to the lord on whom they believed
and after they had passed throughout pisidia they came to pamphylia
and when they had preached the word in perga they went down into attalia
and thence sailed to antioch from whence they had been recommended to the grace of god for the work which they fulfilled
and when they were come and had gathered the church together they rehearsed all that god had done with them and how he had opened the door of faith unto the gentiles
and there they abode long time with the disciples
and certain men which came down from judaea taught the brethren and said except ye be circumcised after the manner of moses ye cannot be saved
when therefore paul and barnabas had no small dissension and disputation with them they determined that paul and barnabas and certain other of them should go up to jerusalem unto the apostles and elders about this question
and being brought on their way by the church they passed through phenice and samaria declaring the conversion of the gentiles and they caused great joy unto all the brethren
and when they were come to jerusalem they were received of the church and of the apostles and elders and they declared all things that god had done with them
but there rose up certain of the sect of the pharisees which believed saying that it was needful to circumcise them and to command them to keep the law of moses
and the apostles and elders came together for to consider of this matter
and when there had been much disputing peter rose up and said unto them men and brethren ye know how that a good while ago god made choice among us that the gentiles by my mouth should hear the word of the gospel and believe
and god which knoweth the hearts bare them witness giving them the holy ghost even as he did unto us
and put no difference between us and them purifying their hearts by faith
now therefore why tempt ye god to put a yoke upon the neck of the disciples which neither our fathers nor we were able to bear
but we believe that through the grace of the lord jesus christ we shall be saved even as they
then all the multitude kept silence and gave audience to barnabas and paul declaring what miracles and wonders god had wrought among the gentiles by them
and after they had held their peace james answered saying men and brethren hearken unto me
simeon hath declared how god at the first did visit the gentiles to take out of them a people for his name
and to this agree the words of the prophets as it is written
after this i will return and will build again the tabernacle of david which is fallen down and i will build again the ruins thereof and i will set it up
that the residue of men might seek after the lord and all the gentiles upon whom my name is called saith the lord who doeth all these things
known unto god are all his works from the beginning of the world
wherefore my sentence is that we trouble not them which from among the gentiles are turned to god
but that we write unto them that they abstain from pollutions of idols and from fornication and from things strangled and from blood
for moses of old time hath in every city them that preach him being read in the synagogues every sabbath day
then pleased it the apostles and elders with the whole church to send chosen men of their own company to antioch with paul and barnabas namely judas surnamed barsabas and silas chief men among the brethren
and they wrote letters by them after this manner the apostles and elders and brethren send greeting unto the brethren which are of the gentiles in antioch and syria and cilicia
forasmuch as we have heard that certain which went out from us have troubled you with words subverting your souls saying ye must be circumcised and keep the law to whom we gave no such commandment
it seemed good unto us being assembled with one accord to send chosen men unto you with our beloved barnabas and paul
men that have hazarded their lives for the name of our lord jesus christ
we have sent therefore judas and silas who shall also tell you the same things by mouth
for it seemed good to the holy ghost and to us to lay upon you no greater burden than these necessary things
that ye abstain from meats offered to idols and from blood and from things strangled and from fornication from which if ye keep yourselves ye shall do well fare ye well
so when they were dismissed they came to antioch and when they had gathered the multitude together they delivered the epistle
which when they had read they rejoiced for the consolation
and judas and silas being prophets also themselves exhorted the brethren with many words and confirmed them
and after they had tarried there a space they were let go in peace from the brethren unto the apostles
notwithstanding it pleased silas to abide there still
paul also and barnabas continued in antioch teaching and preaching the word of the lord with many others also
and some days after paul said unto barnabas let us go again and visit our brethren in every city where we have preached the word of the lord and see how they do
and barnabas determined to take with them john whose surname was mark
but paul thought not good to take him with them who departed from them from pamphylia and went not with them to the work
and the contention was so sharp between them that they departed asunder one from the other and so barnabas took mark and sailed unto cyprus
and paul chose silas and departed being recommended by the brethren unto the grace of god
and he went through syria and cilicia confirming the churches
then came he to derbe and lystra and behold a certain disciple was there named timotheus the son of a certain woman which was a jewess and believed but his father was a greek
which was well reported of by the brethren that were at lystra and iconium
him would paul have to go forth with him and took and circumcised him because of the jews which were in those quarters for they knew all that his father was a greek
and as they went through the cities they delivered them the decrees for to keep that were ordained of the apostles and elders which were at jerusalem
and so were the churches established in the faith and increased in number daily
now when they had gone throughout phrygia and the region of galatia and were forbidden of the holy ghost to preach the word in asia
after they were come to mysia they assayed to go into bithynia but the spirit suffered them not
and they passing by mysia came down to troas
and a vision appeared to paul in the night there stood a man of macedonia and prayed him saying come over into macedonia and help us
and after he had seen the vision immediately we endeavoured to go into macedonia assuredly gathering that the lord had called us for to preach the gospel unto them
therefore loosing from troas we came with a straight course to samothracia and the next day to neapolis
and from thence to philippi which is the chief city of that part of macedonia and a colony and we were in that city abiding certain days
and on the sabbath we went out of the city by a river side where prayer was wont to be made and we sat down and spake unto the women which resorted thither
and a certain woman named lydia a seller of purple of the city of thyatira which worshipped god heard us whose heart the lord opened that she attended unto the things which were spoken of paul
and when she was baptized and her household she besought us saying if ye have judged me to be faithful to the lord come into my house and abide there and she constrained us
and it came to pass as we went to prayer a certain damsel possessed with a spirit of divination met us which brought her masters much gain by soothsaying
the same followed paul and us and cried saying these men are the servants of the most high god which shew unto us the way of salvation
and this did she many days but paul being grieved turned and said to the spirit i command thee in the name of jesus christ to come out of her and he came out the same hour
and when her masters saw that the hope of their gains was gone they caught paul and silas and drew them into the marketplace unto the rulers
and brought them to the magistrates saying these men being jews do exceedingly trouble our city
and teach customs which are not lawful for us to receive neither to observe being romans
and the multitude rose up together against them and the magistrates rent off their clothes and commanded to beat them
and when they had laid many stripes upon them they cast them into prison charging the jailor to keep them safely
who having received such a charge thrust them into the inner prison and made their feet fast in the stocks
and at midnight paul and silas prayed and sang praises unto god and the prisoners heard them
and suddenly there was a great earthquake so that the foundations of the prison were shaken and immediately all the doors were opened and every one's bands were loosed
and the keeper of the prison awaking out of his sleep and seeing the prison doors open he drew out his sword and would have killed himself supposing that the prisoners had been fled
but paul cried with a loud voice saying do thyself no harm for we are all here
then he called for a light and sprang in and came trembling and fell down before paul and silas
and brought them out and said sirs what must i do to be saved
and they said believe on the lord jesus christ and thou shalt be saved and thy house
and they spake unto him the word of the lord and to all that were in his house
and he took them the same hour of the night and washed their stripes and was baptized he and all his straightway
and when he had brought them into his house he set meat before them and rejoiced believing in god with all his house
and when it was day the magistrates sent the serjeants saying let those men go
and the keeper of the prison told this saying to paul the magistrates have sent to let you go now therefore depart and go in peace
but paul said unto them they have beaten us openly uncondemned being romans and have cast us into prison and now do they thrust us out privily nay verily but let them come themselves and fetch us out
and the serjeants told these words unto the magistrates and they feared when they heard that they were romans
and they came and besought them and brought them out and desired them to depart out of the city
and they went out of the prison and entered into the house of lydia and when they had seen the brethren they comforted them and departed
now when they had passed through amphipolis and apollonia they came to thessalonica where was a synagogue of the jews
and paul as his manner was went in unto them and three sabbath days reasoned with them out of the scriptures
opening and alleging that christ must needs have suffered and risen again from the dead and that this jesus whom i preach unto you is christ
and some of them believed and consorted with paul and silas and of the devout greeks a great multitude and of the chief women not a few
but the jews which believed not moved with envy took unto them certain lewd fellows of the baser sort and gathered a company and set all the city on an uproar and assaulted the house of jason and sought to bring them out to the people
and when they found them not they drew jason and certain brethren unto the rulers of the city crying these that have turned the world upside down are come hither also
whom jason hath received and these all do contrary to the decrees of caesar saying that there is another king one jesus
and they troubled the people and the rulers of the city when they heard these things
and when they had taken security of jason and of the other they let them go
and the brethren immediately sent away paul and silas by night unto berea who coming thither went into the synagogue of the jews
these were more noble than those in thessalonica in that they received the word with all readiness of mind and searched the scriptures daily whether those things were so
therefore many of them believed also of honourable women which were greeks and of men not a few
but when the jews of thessalonica had knowledge that the word of god was preached of paul at berea they came thither also and stirred up the people
and then immediately the brethren sent away paul to go as it were to the sea but silas and timotheus abode there still
and they that conducted paul brought him unto athens and receiving a commandment unto silas and timotheus for to come to him with all speed they departed
now while paul waited for them at athens his spirit was stirred in him when he saw the city wholly given to idolatry
therefore disputed he in the synagogue with the jews and with the devout persons and in the market daily with them that met with him
then certain philosophers of the epicureans and of the stoicks encountered him and some said what will this babbler say other some he seemeth to be a setter forth of strange gods because he preached unto them jesus and the resurrection
and they took him and brought him unto areopagus saying may we know what this new doctrine whereof thou speakest is
for thou bringest certain strange things to our ears we would know therefore what these things mean
for all the athenians and strangers which were there spent their time in nothing else but either to tell or to hear some new thing
then paul stood in the midst of mars hill and said ye men of athens i perceive that in all things ye are too superstitious
for as i passed by and beheld your devotions i found an altar with this inscription to the unknown god whom therefore ye ignorantly worship him declare i unto you
god that made the world and all things therein seeing that he is lord of heaven and earth dwelleth not in temples made with hands
neither is worshipped with men's hands as though he needed any thing seeing he giveth to all life and breath and all things
and hath made of one blood all nations of men for to dwell on all the face of the earth and hath determined the times before appointed and the bounds of their habitation
that they should seek the lord if haply they might feel after him and find him though he be not far from every one of us
for in him we live and move and have our being as certain also of your own poets have said for we are also his offspring
forasmuch then as we are the offspring of god we ought not to think that the godhead is like unto gold or silver or stone graven by art and man's device
and the times of this ignorance god winked at but now commandeth all men every where to repent
because he hath appointed a day in the which he will judge the world in righteousness by that man whom he hath ordained whereof he hath given assurance unto all men in that he hath raised him from the dead
and when they heard of the resurrection of the dead some mocked and others said we will hear thee again of this matter
so paul departed from among them
howbeit certain men clave unto him and believed among the which was dionysius the areopagite and a woman named damaris and others with them
after these things paul departed from athens and came to corinth
and found a certain jew named aquila born in pontus lately come from italy with his wife priscilla because that claudius had commanded all jews to depart from rome and came unto them
and because he was of the same craft he abode with them and wrought for by their occupation they were tentmakers
and he reasoned in the synagogue every sabbath and persuaded the jews and the greeks
and when silas and timotheus were come from macedonia paul was pressed in the spirit and testified to the jews that jesus was christ
and when they opposed themselves and blasphemed he shook his raiment and said unto them your blood be upon your own heads i am clean from henceforth i will go unto the gentiles
and he departed thence and entered into a certain man's house named justus one that worshipped god whose house joined hard to the synagogue
and crispus the chief ruler of the synagogue believed on the lord with all his house and many of the corinthians hearing believed and were baptized
then spake the lord to paul in the night by a vision be not afraid but speak and hold not thy peace
for i am with thee and no man shall set on thee to hurt thee for i have much people in this city
and he continued there a year and six months teaching the word of god among them
and when gallio was the deputy of achaia the jews made insurrection with one accord against paul and brought him to the judgment seat
saying this fellow persuadeth men to worship god contrary to the law
and when paul was now about to open his mouth gallio said unto the jews if it were a matter of wrong or wicked lewdness o ye jews reason would that i should bear with you
but if it be a question of words and names and of your law look ye to it for i will be no judge of such matters
and he drave them from the judgment seat
then all the greeks took sosthenes the chief ruler of the synagogue and beat him before the judgment seat and gallio cared for none of those things
and paul after this tarried there yet a good while and then took his leave of the brethren and sailed thence into syria and with him priscilla and aquila having shorn his head in cenchrea for he had a vow
and he came to ephesus and left them there but he himself entered into the synagogue and reasoned with the jews
when they desired him to tarry longer time with them he consented not
but bade them farewell saying i must by all means keep this feast that cometh in jerusalem but i will return again unto you if god will and he sailed from ephesus
and when he had landed at caesarea and gone up and saluted the church he went down to antioch
and after he had spent some time there he departed and went over all the country of galatia and phrygia in order strengthening all the disciples
and a certain jew named apollos born at alexandria an eloquent man and mighty in the scriptures came to ephesus
this man was instructed in the way of the lord and being fervent in the spirit he spake and taught diligently the things of the lord knowing only the baptism of john
and he began to speak boldly in the synagogue whom when aquila and priscilla had heard they took him unto them and expounded unto him the way of god more perfectly
and when he was disposed to pass into achaia the brethren wrote exhorting the disciples to receive him who when he was come helped them much which had believed through grace
for he mightily convinced the jews and that publickly shewing by the scriptures that jesus was christ
and it came to pass that while apollos was at corinth paul having passed through the upper coasts came to ephesus and finding certain disciples
he said unto them have ye received the holy ghost since ye believed and they said unto him we have not so much as heard whether there be any holy ghost
and he said unto them unto what then were ye baptized and they said unto john's baptism
then said paul john verily baptized with the baptism of repentance saying unto the people that they should believe on him which should come after him that is on christ jesus
when they heard this they were baptized in the name of the lord jesus
and when paul had laid his hands upon them the holy ghost came on them and they spake with tongues and prophesied
and all the men were about twelve
and he went into the synagogue and spake boldly for the space of three months disputing and persuading the things concerning the kingdom of god
but when divers were hardened and believed not but spake evil of that way before the multitude he departed from them and separated the disciples disputing daily in the school of one tyrannus
and this continued by the space of two years so that all they which dwelt in asia heard the word of the lord jesus both jews and greeks
and god wrought special miracles by the hands of paul
so that from his body were brought unto the sick handkerchiefs or aprons and the diseases departed from them and the evil spirits went out of them
