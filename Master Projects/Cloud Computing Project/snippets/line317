 upon the thracian tyrant in his tent
 may favor tamora the queen of goths
 when goths were goths and tamora was queen
 to quit the bloody wrongs upon her foes
 reenter lucius quintus martius and mutius with
 their swords bloody
lucius see lord and father how we have perform'd
 our roman rites alarbus limbs are lopp'd
 and entrails feed the sacrificing fire
 whose smoke like incense doth perfume the sky
 remaineth nought but to inter our brethren
 and with loud larums welcome them to rome
titus andronicus let it be so and let andronicus
 make this his latest farewell to their souls
 trumpets sounded and the coffin laid in the tomb
 in peace and honour rest you here my sons
 rome's readiest champions repose you here in rest
 secure from worldly chances and mishaps
 here lurks no treason here no envy swells
 here grow no damned grudges here are no storms
 no noise but silence and eternal sleep
 in peace and honour rest you here my sons
 enter lavinia
lavinia in peace and honour live lord titus long
 my noble lord and father live in fame
 lo at this tomb my tributary tears
 i render for my brethren's obsequies
 and at thy feet i kneel with tears of joy
 shed on the earth for thy return to rome
 o bless me here with thy victorious hand
 whose fortunes rome's best citizens applaud
titus andronicus kind rome that hast thus lovingly reserved
 the cordial of mine age to glad my heart
 lavinia live outlive thy father's days
 and fame's eternal date for virtue's praise
 enter below marcus andronicus and tribunes
 reenter saturninus and bassianus attended
marcus andronicus long live lord titus my beloved brother
 gracious triumpher in the eyes of rome
titus andronicus thanks gentle tribune noble brother marcus
marcus andronicus and welcome nephews from successful wars
 you that survive and you that sleep in fame
 fair lords your fortunes are alike in all
 that in your country's service drew your swords
 but safer triumph is this funeral pomp
 that hath aspired to solon's happiness
 and triumphs over chance in honour's bed
 titus andronicus the people of rome
 whose friend in justice thou hast ever been
 send thee by me their tribune and their trust
 this palliament of white and spotless hue
 and name thee in election for the empire
 with these our latedeceased emperor's sons
 be candidatus then and put it on
 and help to set a head on headless rome
titus andronicus a better head her glorious body fits
 than his that shakes for age and feebleness
 what should i don this robe and trouble you
 be chosen with proclamations today
 tomorrow yield up rule resign my life
 and set abroad new business for you all
 rome i have been thy soldier forty years
 and led my country's strength successfully
 and buried one and twenty valiant sons
 knighted in field slain manfully in arms
 in right and service of their noble country
 give me a staff of honour for mine age
 but not a sceptre to control the world
 upright he held it lords that held it last
marcus andronicus titus thou shalt obtain and ask the empery
saturninus proud and ambitious tribune canst thou tell
titus andronicus patience prince saturninus
saturninus romans do me right
 patricians draw your swords and sheathe them not
 till saturninus be rome's emperor
 andronicus would thou wert shipp'd to hell
 rather than rob me of the people's hearts
lucius proud saturnine interrupter of the good
 that nobleminded titus means to thee
titus andronicus content thee prince i will restore to thee
 the people's hearts and wean them from themselves
bassianus andronicus i do not flatter thee
 but honour thee and will do till i die
 my faction if thou strengthen with thy friends
 i will most thankful be and thanks to men
 of noble minds is honourable meed
titus andronicus people of rome and people's tribunes here
 i ask your voices and your suffrages
 will you bestow them friendly on andronicus
tribunes to gratify the good andronicus
 and gratulate his safe return to rome
 the people will accept whom he admits
titus andronicus tribunes i thank you and this suit i make
 that you create your emperor's eldest son
 lord saturnine whose virtues will i hope
 reflect on rome as titan's rays on earth
 and ripen justice in this commonweal
 then if you will elect by my advice
 crown him and say long live our emperor'
marcus andronicus with voices and applause of every sort
 patricians and plebeians we create
 lord saturninus rome's great emperor
 and say long live our emperor saturnine'
 a long flourish till they come down
saturninus titus andronicus for thy favors done
 to us in our election this day
 i give thee thanks in part of thy deserts
 and will with deeds requite thy gentleness
 and for an onset titus to advance
 thy name and honourable family
 lavinia will i make my empress
 rome's royal mistress mistress of my heart
 and in the sacred pantheon her espouse
 tell me andronicus doth this motion please thee
titus andronicus it doth my worthy lord and in this match
 i hold me highly honour'd of your grace
 and here in sight of rome to saturnine
 king and commander of our commonweal
 the wide world's emperor do i consecrate
 my sword my chariot and my prisoners
 presents well worthy rome's imperial lord
 receive them then the tribute that i owe
 mine honour's ensigns humbled at thy feet
saturninus thanks noble titus father of my life
 how proud i am of thee and of thy gifts
 rome shall record and when i do forget
 the least of these unspeakable deserts
 romans forget your fealty to me
titus andronicus to tamora now madam are you prisoner to
 an emperor
 to him that for your honour and your state
 will use you nobly and your followers
saturninus a goodly lady trust me of the hue
 that i would choose were i to choose anew
 clear up fair queen that cloudy countenance
 though chance of war hath wrought this change of cheer
 thou comest not to be made a scorn in rome
 princely shall be thy usage every way
 rest on my word and let not discontent
 daunt all your hopes madam he comforts you
 can make you greater than the queen of goths
 lavinia you are not displeased with this
lavinia not i my lord sith true nobility
 warrants these words in princely courtesy
saturninus thanks sweet lavinia romans let us go
 ransomless here we set our prisoners free
 proclaim our honours lords with trump and drum
 flourish saturninus courts tamora in dumb show
bassianus lord titus by your leave this maid is mine
 seizing lavinia
titus andronicus how sir are you in earnest then my lord
bassianus ay noble titus and resolved withal
 to do myself this reason and this right
marcus andronicus suum cuique is our roman justice
 this prince in justice seizeth but his own
lucius and that he will and shall if lucius live
titus andronicus traitors avaunt where is the emperor's guard
 treason my lord lavinia is surprised
saturninus surprised by whom
bassianus by him that justly may
 bear his betroth'd from all the world away
 exeunt bassianus and marcus with lavinia
mutius brothers help to convey her hence away
 and with my sword i'll keep this door safe
 exeunt lucius quintus and martius
titus andronicus follow my lord and i'll soon bring her back
mutius my lord you pass not here
titus andronicus what villain boy
 barr'st me my way in rome
 stabbing mutius
mutius help lucius help
 dies
 during the fray saturninus tamora demetrius
 chiron and aaron go out and reenter above
 reenter lucius
lucius my lord you are unjust and more than so
 in wrongful quarrel you have slain your son
titus andronicus nor thou nor he are any sons of mine
 my sons would never so dishonour me
 traitor restore lavinia to the emperor
lucius dead if you will but not to be his wife
 that is another's lawful promised love
 exit
saturninus no titus no the emperor needs her not
 nor her nor thee nor any of thy stock
 i'll trust by leisure him that mocks me once
 thee never nor thy traitorous haughty sons
 confederates all thus to dishonour me
 was there none else in rome to make a stale
 but saturnine full well andronicus
 agree these deeds with that proud brag of thine
 that said'st i begg'd the empire at thy hands
titus andronicus o monstrous what reproachful words are these
saturninus but go thy ways go give that changing piece
 to him that flourish'd for her with his sword
 a valiant soninlaw thou shalt enjoy
 one fit to bandy with thy lawless sons
 to ruffle in the commonwealth of rome
titus andronicus these words are razors to my wounded heart
saturninus and therefore lovely tamora queen of goths
