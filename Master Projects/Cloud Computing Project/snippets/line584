 on you i can hardly think you my master
valentine are all these things perceived in me
speed they are all perceived without ye
valentine without me they cannot
speed without you nay that's certain for without you
 were so simple none else would but you are so
 without these follies that these follies are within
 you and shine through you like the water in an
 urinal that not an eye that sees you but is a
 physician to comment on your malady
valentine but tell me dost thou know my lady silvia
speed she that you gaze on so as she sits at supper
valentine hast thou observed that even she i mean
speed why sir i know her not
valentine dost thou know her by my gazing on her and yet
 knowest her not
speed is she not hardfavoured sir
valentine not so fair boy as wellfavoured
speed sir i know that well enough
valentine what dost thou know
speed that she is not so fair as of you wellfavoured
valentine i mean that her beauty is exquisite but her favour infinite
speed that's because the one is painted and the other out
 of all count
valentine how painted and how out of count
speed marry sir so painted to make her fair that no
 man counts of her beauty
valentine how esteemest thou me i account of her beauty
speed you never saw her since she was deformed
valentine how long hath she been deformed
speed ever since you loved her
valentine i have loved her ever since i saw her and still i
 see her beautiful
speed if you love her you cannot see her
valentine why
speed because love is blind o that you had mine eyes
 or your own eyes had the lights they were wont to
 have when you chid at sir proteus for going
 ungartered
valentine what should i see then
speed your own present folly and her passing deformity
 for he being in love could not see to garter his
 hose and you being in love cannot see to put on your hose
valentine belike boy then you are in love for last
 morning you could not see to wipe my shoes
speed true sir i was in love with my bed i thank you
 you swinged me for my love which makes me the
 bolder to chide you for yours
valentine in conclusion i stand affected to her
speed i would you were set so your affection would cease
valentine last night she enjoined me to write some lines to
 one she loves
speed and have you
valentine i have
speed are they not lamely writ
valentine no boy but as well as i can do them peace
 here she comes
speed aside o excellent motion o exceeding puppet
 now will he interpret to her
 enter silvia
valentine madam and mistress a thousand goodmorrows
speed aside o give ye good even here's a million of manners
silvia sir valentine and servant to you two thousand
speed aside he should give her interest and she gives it him
valentine as you enjoin'd me i have writ your letter
 unto the secret nameless friend of yours
 which i was much unwilling to proceed in
 but for my duty to your ladyship
silvia i thank you gentle servant tis very clerkly done
valentine now trust me madam it came hardly off
 for being ignorant to whom it goes
 i writ at random very doubtfully
silvia perchance you think too much of so much pains
valentine no madam so it stead you i will write
 please you command a thousand times as much and yet
silvia a pretty period well i guess the sequel
 and yet i will not name it and yet i care not
 and yet take this again and yet i thank you
 meaning henceforth to trouble you no more
speed aside and yet you will and yet another yet'
valentine what means your ladyship do you not like it
silvia yes yes the lines are very quaintly writ
 but since unwillingly take them again
 nay take them
valentine madam they are for you
silvia ay ay you writ them sir at my request
 but i will none of them they are for you
 i would have had them writ more movingly
valentine please you i'll write your ladyship another
silvia and when it's writ for my sake read it over
 and if it please you so if not why so
valentine if it please me madam what then
silvia why if it please you take it for your labour
 and so good morrow servant
 exit
speed o jest unseen inscrutable invisible
 as a nose on a man's face or a weathercock on a steeple
 my master sues to her and she hath
 taught her suitor
 he being her pupil to become her tutor
 o excellent device was there ever heard a better
 that my master being scribe to himself should write
 the letter
valentine how now sir what are you reasoning with yourself
speed nay i was rhyming tis you that have the reason
valentine to do what
speed to be a spokesman for madam silvia
valentine to whom
speed to yourself why she wooes you by a figure
valentine what figure
speed by a letter i should say
valentine why she hath not writ to me
speed what need she when she hath made you write to
 yourself why do you not perceive the jest
valentine no believe me
speed no believing you indeed sir but did you perceive
 her earnest
valentine she gave me none except an angry word
speed why she hath given you a letter
valentine that's the letter i writ to her friend
speed and that letter hath she delivered and there an end
valentine i would it were no worse
speed i'll warrant you tis as well
 for often have you writ to her and she in modesty
 or else for want of idle time could not again reply
 or fearing else some messenger that might her mind discover
 herself hath taught her love himself to write unto her lover
 all this i speak in print for in print i found it
 why muse you sir tis dinnertime
valentine i have dined
speed ay but hearken sir though the chameleon love can
 feed on the air i am one that am nourished by my
 victuals and would fain have meat o be not like
 your mistress be moved be moved
