leonato indeed he looks younger than he did by the loss of a beard
don pedro nay a rubs himself with civet can you smell him
 out by that
claudio that's as much as to say the sweet youth's in love
don pedro the greatest note of it is his melancholy
claudio and when was he wont to wash his face
don pedro yea or to paint himself for the which i hear
 what they say of him
claudio nay but his jesting spirit which is now crept into
 a lutestring and now governed by stops
don pedro indeed that tells a heavy tale for him conclude
 conclude he is in love
claudio nay but i know who loves him
don pedro that would i know too i warrant one that knows him not
claudio yes and his ill conditions and in despite of
 all dies for him
don pedro she shall be buried with her face upwards

 signior walk aside with me i have studied eight
 or nine wise words to speak to you which these
 hobbyhorses must not hear

 played their parts with beatrice and then the two
 bears will not bite one another when they meet

act iii
scene iii a street
 enter dogberry and verges with the watch
dogberry are you good men and true
verges yea or else it were pity but they should suffer
 salvation body and soul
dogberry nay that were a punishment too good for them if
 they should have any allegiance in them being
 chosen for the prince's watch
verges well give them their charge neighbour dogberry
dogberry first who think you the most desertless man to be
 constable
first watchman hugh otecake sir or george seacole for they can
 write and read
dogberry come hither neighbour seacole god hath blessed
 you with a good name to be a wellfavoured man is
 the gift of fortune but to write and read comes by nature
second watchman both which master constable
dogberry you have i knew it would be your answer well
 for your favour sir why give god thanks and make
 no boast of it and for your writing and reading
 let that appear when there is no need of such
 vanity you are thought here to be the most
 senseless and fit man for the constable of the
 watch therefore bear you the lantern this is your
 charge you shall comprehend all vagrom men you are
 to bid any man stand in the prince's name
second watchman how if a will not stand
dogberry why then take no note of him but let him go and
 presently call the rest of the watch together and
 thank god you are rid of a knave
verges if he will not stand when he is bidden he is none
 of the prince's subjects
dogberry true and they are to meddle with none but the
 prince's subjects you shall also make no noise in
 the streets for for the watch to babble and to
 talk is most tolerable and not to be endured
watchman we will rather sleep than talk we know what
 belongs to a watch
dogberry why you speak like an ancient and most quiet
 watchman for i cannot see how sleeping should
 offend only have a care that your bills be not
 stolen well you are to call at all the
 alehouses and bid those that are drunk get them to bed
watchman how if they will not
dogberry why then let them alone till they are sober if
 they make you not then the better answer you may
 say they are not the men you took them for
watchman well sir
dogberry if you meet a thief you may suspect him by virtue
 of your office to be no true man and for such
 kind of men the less you meddle or make with them
 why the more is for your honesty
watchman if we know him to be a thief shall we not lay
 hands on him
dogberry truly by your office you may but i think they
 that touch pitch will be defiled the most peaceable
 way for you if you do take a thief is to let him
 show himself what he is and steal out of your company
verges you have been always called a merciful man partner
dogberry truly i would not hang a dog by my will much more
 a man who hath any honesty in him
verges if you hear a child cry in the night you must call
 to the nurse and bid her still it
watchman how if the nurse be asleep and will not hear us
dogberry why then depart in peace and let the child wake
 her with crying for the ewe that will not hear her
 lamb when it baes will never answer a calf when he bleats
verges tis very true
dogberry this is the end of the chargeyou constable are
 to present the prince's own person if you meet the
 prince in the night you may stay him
verges nay by'r our lady that i think a cannot
dogberry five shillings to one on't with any man that knows
 the statutes he may stay him marry not without
 the prince be willing for indeed the watch ought
 to offend no man and it is an offence to stay a
 man against his will
verges by'r lady i think it be so
dogberry ha ha ha well masters good night an there be
 any matter of weight chances call up me keep your
 fellows counsels and your own and good night
 come neighbour
watchman well masters we hear our charge let us go sit here
 upon the churchbench till two and then all to bed
dogberry one word more honest neighbours i pray you watch
 about signior leonato's door for the wedding being
 there tomorrow there is a great coil tonight
 adieu be vigitant i beseech you
 exeunt dogberry and verges
 enter borachio and conrade
borachio what conrade
watchman aside peace stir not
borachio conrade i say
conrade here man i am at thy elbow
borachio mass and my elbow itched i thought there would a
 scab follow
conrade i will owe thee an answer for that and now forward
 with thy tale
borachio stand thee close then under this penthouse for
 it drizzles rain and i will like a true drunkard
 utter all to thee
watchman aside some treason masters yet stand close
borachio therefore know i have earned of don john a thousand ducats
conrade is it possible that any villany should be so dear
borachio thou shouldst rather ask if it were possible any
 villany should be so rich for when rich villains
 have need of poor ones poor ones may make what
 price they will
conrade i wonder at it
borachio that shows thou art unconfirmed thou knowest that
 the fashion of a doublet or a hat or a cloak is
 nothing to a man
conrade yes it is apparel
borachio i mean the fashion
conrade yes the fashion is the fashion
borachio tush i may as well say the fool's the fool but
 seest thou not what a deformed thief this fashion
 is
watchman aside i know that deformed a has been a vile
