scene ii the forest
 enter orlando and oliver
orlando is't possible that on so little acquaintance you
 should like her that but seeing you should love
 her and loving woo and wooing she should
 grant and will you persever to enjoy her
oliver neither call the giddiness of it in question the
 poverty of her the small acquaintance my sudden
 wooing nor her sudden consenting but say with me
 i love aliena say with her that she loves me
 consent with both that we may enjoy each other it
 shall be to your good for my father's house and all
 the revenue that was old sir rowland's will i
 estate upon you and here live and die a shepherd
orlando you have my consent let your wedding be tomorrow
 thither will i invite the duke and all's contented
 followers go you and prepare aliena for look
 you here comes my rosalind
 enter rosalind
rosalind god save you brother
oliver and you fair sister
 exit
rosalind o my dear orlando how it grieves me to see thee
 wear thy heart in a scarf
orlando it is my arm
rosalind i thought thy heart had been wounded with the claws
 of a lion
orlando wounded it is but with the eyes of a lady
rosalind did your brother tell you how i counterfeited to
 swoon when he showed me your handkerchief
orlando ay and greater wonders than that
rosalind o i know where you are nay tis true there was
 never any thing so sudden but the fight of two rams
 and caesar's thrasonical brag of i came saw and
 overcame for your brother and my sister no sooner
 met but they looked no sooner looked but they
 loved no sooner loved but they sighed no sooner
 sighed but they asked one another the reason no
 sooner knew the reason but they sought the remedy
 and in these degrees have they made a pair of stairs
 to marriage which they will climb incontinent or
 else be incontinent before marriage they are in
 the very wrath of love and they will together clubs
 cannot part them
orlando they shall be married tomorrow and i will bid the
 duke to the nuptial but o how bitter a thing it
 is to look into happiness through another man's
 eyes by so much the more shall i tomorrow be at
 the height of heartheaviness by how much i shall
 think my brother happy in having what he wishes for
rosalind why then tomorrow i cannot serve your turn for rosalind
orlando i can live no longer by thinking
rosalind i will weary you then no longer with idle talking
 know of me then for now i speak to some purpose
 that i know you are a gentleman of good conceit i
 speak not this that you should bear a good opinion
 of my knowledge insomuch i say i know you are
 neither do i labour for a greater esteem than may in
 some little measure draw a belief from you to do
 yourself good and not to grace me believe then if
 you please that i can do strange things i have
 since i was three year old conversed with a
 magician most profound in his art and yet not
 damnable if you do love rosalind so near the heart
 as your gesture cries it out when your brother
 marries aliena shall you marry her i know into
 what straits of fortune she is driven and it is
 not impossible to me if it appear not inconvenient
 to you to set her before your eyes tomorrow human
 as she is and without any danger
orlando speakest thou in sober meanings
rosalind by my life i do which i tender dearly though i
 say i am a magician therefore put you in your
 best array bid your friends for if you will be
 married tomorrow you shall and to rosalind if you will

 it was a lover and his lass
 with a hey and a ho and a hey nonino
 that o'er the green cornfield did pass
 in the spring time the only pretty ring time
 when birds do sing hey ding a ding ding
 sweet lovers love the spring
 between the acres of the rye
 with a hey and a ho and a hey nonino
 these pretty country folks would lie
 in spring time &c
 this carol they began that hour
 with a hey and a ho and a hey nonino
 how that a life was but a flower
 in spring time &c
 and therefore take the present time
 with a hey and a ho and a hey nonino
 for love is crowned with the prime
 in spring time &c

 matter in the ditty yet the note was very
 untuneable
