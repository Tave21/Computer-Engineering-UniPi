 his face thou hast for even so look'd he
 accomplish'd with the number of thy hours
 but when he frown'd it was against the french
 and not against his friends his noble hand
 did will what he did spend and spent not that
 which his triumphant father's hand had won
 his hands were guilty of no kindred blood
 but bloody with the enemies of his kin
 o richard york is too far gone with grief
 or else he never would compare between
king richard ii why uncle what's the matter
duke of york o my liege
 pardon me if you please if not i pleased
 not to be pardon'd am content withal
 seek you to seize and gripe into your hands
 the royalties and rights of banish'd hereford
 is not gaunt dead and doth not hereford live
 was not gaunt just and is not harry true
 did not the one deserve to have an heir
 is not his heir a welldeserving son
 take hereford's rights away and take from time
 his charters and his customary rights
 let not tomorrow then ensue today
 be not thyself for how art thou a king
 but by fair sequence and succession
 now afore godgod forbid i say true
 if you do wrongfully seize hereford's rights
 call in the letters patent that he hath
 by his attorneysgeneral to sue
 his livery and deny his offer'd homage
 you pluck a thousand dangers on your head
 you lose a thousand welldisposed hearts
 and prick my tender patience to those thoughts
 which honour and allegiance cannot think
king richard ii think what you will we seize into our hands
 his plate his goods his money and his lands
duke of york i'll not be by the while my liege farewell
 what will ensue hereof there's none can tell
 but by bad courses may be understood
 that their events can never fall out good
 exit
king richard ii go bushy to the earl of wiltshire straight
 bid him repair to us to ely house
 to see this business tomorrow next
 we will for ireland and tis time i trow
 and we create in absence of ourself
 our uncle york lord governor of england
 for he is just and always loved us well
 come on our queen tomorrow must we part
 be merry for our time of stay is short
 flourish exeunt king richard ii queen duke of
 aumerle bushy green and bagot
northumberland well lords the duke of lancaster is dead
lord ross and living too for now his son is duke
lord willoughby barely in title not in revenue
northumberland richly in both if justice had her right
lord ross my heart is great but it must break with silence
 ere't be disburden'd with a liberal tongue
northumberland nay speak thy mind and let him ne'er speak more
 that speaks thy words again to do thee harm
lord willoughby tends that thou wouldst speak to the duke of hereford
 if it be so out with it boldly man
 quick is mine ear to hear of good towards him
lord ross no good at all that i can do for him
 unless you call it good to pity him
 bereft and gelded of his patrimony
northumberland now afore god tis shame such wrongs are borne
 in him a royal prince and many moe
 of noble blood in this declining land
 the king is not himself but basely led
 by flatterers and what they will inform
 merely in hate gainst any of us all
 that will the king severely prosecute
 gainst us our lives our children and our heirs
lord ross the commons hath he pill'd with grievous taxes
 and quite lost their hearts the nobles hath he fined
 for ancient quarrels and quite lost their hearts
lord willoughby and daily new exactions are devised
 as blanks benevolences and i wot not what
 but what o god's name doth become of this
northumberland wars have not wasted it for warr'd he hath not
 but basely yielded upon compromise
 that which his noble ancestors achieved with blows
 more hath he spent in peace than they in wars
lord ross the earl of wiltshire hath the realm in farm
lord willoughby the king's grown bankrupt like a broken man
northumberland reproach and dissolution hangeth over him
lord ross he hath not money for these irish wars
 his burthenous taxations notwithstanding
 but by the robbing of the banish'd duke
northumberland his noble kinsman most degenerate king
 but lords we hear this fearful tempest sing
 yet see no shelter to avoid the storm
 we see the wind sit sore upon our sails
 and yet we strike not but securely perish
lord ross we see the very wreck that we must suffer
 and unavoided is the danger now
 for suffering so the causes of our wreck
northumberland not so even through the hollow eyes of death
 i spy life peering but i dare not say
 how near the tidings of our comfort is
lord willoughby nay let us share thy thoughts as thou dost ours
lord ross be confident to speak northumberland
 we three are but thyself and speaking so
 thy words are but as thoughts therefore be bold
northumberland then thus i have from port le blanc a bay
 in brittany received intelligence
 that harry duke of hereford rainold lord cobham
 
 that late broke from the duke of exeter
 his brother archbishop late of canterbury
 sir thomas erpingham sir john ramston
 sir john norbery sir robert waterton and francis quoint
 all these well furnish'd by the duke of bretagne
 with eight tall ships three thousand men of war
 are making hither with all due expedience
 and shortly mean to touch our northern shore
 perhaps they had ere this but that they stay
 the first departing of the king for ireland
 if then we shall shake off our slavish yoke
 imp out our drooping country's broken wing
 redeem from broking pawn the blemish'd crown
 wipe off the dust that hides our sceptre's gilt
 and make high majesty look like itself
 away with me in post to ravenspurgh
 but if you faint as fearing to do so
 stay and be secret and myself will go
lord ross to horse to horse urge doubts to them that fear
lord willoughby hold out my horse and i will first be there
 exeunt
 king richard ii
act ii
scene ii the palace
 enter queen bushy and bagot
bushy madam your majesty is too much sad
 you promised when you parted with the king
 to lay aside lifeharming heaviness
 and entertain a cheerful disposition
queen to please the king i did to please myself
 i cannot do it yet i know no cause
 why i should welcome such a guest as grief
 save bidding farewell to so sweet a guest
 as my sweet richard yet again methinks
 some unborn sorrow ripe in fortune's womb
 is coming towards me and my inward soul
 with nothing trembles at some thing it grieves
 more than with parting from my lord the king
bushy each substance of a grief hath twenty shadows
 which shows like grief itself but is not so
 for sorrow's eye glazed with blinding tears
 divides one thing entire to many objects
 like perspectives which rightly gazed upon
 show nothing but confusion eyed awry
 distinguish form so your sweet majesty
 looking awry upon your lord's departure
 find shapes of grief more than himself to wail
 which look'd on as it is is nought but shadows
 of what it is not then thricegracious queen
 more than your lord's departure weep not more's not seen
 or if it be tis with false sorrow's eye
 which for things true weeps things imaginary
queen it may be so but yet my inward soul
 persuades me it is otherwise howe'er it be
 i cannot but be sad so heavy sad
 as though on thinking on no thought i think
 makes me with heavy nothing faint and shrink
bushy tis nothing but conceit my gracious lady
queen tis nothing less conceit is still derived
 from some forefather grief mine is not so
 for nothing had begot my something grief
 or something hath the nothing that i grieve
 tis in reversion that i do possess
 but what it is that is not yet known what
 i cannot name tis nameless woe i wot
 enter green
green god save your majesty and well met gentlemen
 i hope the king is not yet shipp'd for ireland
queen why hopest thou so tis better hope he is
 for his designs crave haste his haste good hope
 then wherefore dost thou hope he is not shipp'd
green that he our hope might have retired his power
 and driven into despair an enemy's hope
 who strongly hath set footing in this land
 the banish'd bolingbroke repeals himself
 and with uplifted arms is safe arrived
 at ravenspurgh
queen now god in heaven forbid
green ah madam tis too true and that is worse
 the lord northumberland his son young henry percy
 the lords of ross beaumond and willoughby
 with all their powerful friends are fled to him
bushy why have you not proclaim'd northumberland
 and all the rest revolted faction traitors
green we have whereupon the earl of worcester
 hath broke his staff resign'd his stewardship
 and all the household servants fled with him
 to bolingbroke
queen so green thou art the midwife to my woe
 and bolingbroke my sorrow's dismal heir
 now hath my soul brought forth her prodigy
