 they lay hands on york who struggles
clifford ay ay so strives the woodcock with the gin
northumberland so doth the cony struggle in the net
york so triumph thieves upon their conquer'd booty
 so true men yield with robbers so o'ermatch'd
northumberland what would your grace have done unto him now
queen margaret brave warriors clifford and northumberland
 come make him stand upon this molehill here
 that raught at mountains with outstretched arms
 yet parted but the shadow with his hand
 what was it you that would be england's king
 was't you that revell'd in our parliament
 and made a preachment of your high descent
 where are your mess of sons to back you now
 the wanton edward and the lusty george
 and where's that valiant crookback prodigy
 dicky your boy that with his grumbling voice
 was wont to cheer his dad in mutinies
 or with the rest where is your darling rutland
 look york i stain'd this napkin with the blood
 that valiant clifford with his rapier's point
 made issue from the bosom of the boy
 and if thine eyes can water for his death
 i give thee this to dry thy cheeks withal
 alas poor york but that i hate thee deadly
 i should lament thy miserable state
 i prithee grieve to make me merry york
 what hath thy fiery heart so parch'd thine entrails
 that not a tear can fall for rutland's death
 why art thou patient man thou shouldst be mad
 and i to make thee mad do mock thee thus
 stamp rave and fret that i may sing and dance
 thou wouldst be fee'd i see to make me sport
 york cannot speak unless he wear a crown
 a crown for york and lords bow low to him
 hold you his hands whilst i do set it on
 putting a paper crown on his head
 ay marry sir now looks he like a king
 ay this is he that took king henry's chair
 and this is he was his adopted heir
 but how is it that great plantagenet
 is crown'd so soon and broke his solemn oath
 as i bethink me you should not be king
 till our king henry had shook hands with death
 and will you pale your head in henry's glory
 and rob his temples of the diadem
 now in his life against your holy oath
 o tis a fault too too unpardonable
 off with the crown and with the crown his head
 and whilst we breathe take time to do him dead
clifford that is my office for my father's sake
queen margaret nay stay lets hear the orisons he makes
york shewolf of france but worse than wolves of france
 whose tongue more poisons than the adder's tooth
 how illbeseeming is it in thy sex
 to triumph like an amazonian trull
 upon their woes whom fortune captivates
 but that thy face is vizardlike unchanging
 made impudent with use of evil deeds
 i would assay proud queen to make thee blush
 to tell thee whence thou camest of whom derived
 were shame enough to shame thee wert thou not shameless
 thy father bears the type of king of naples
 of both the sicils and jerusalem
 yet not so wealthy as an english yeoman
 hath that poor monarch taught thee to insult
 it needs not nor it boots thee not proud queen
 unless the adage must be verified
 that beggars mounted run their horse to death
 tis beauty that doth oft make women proud
 but god he knows thy share thereof is small
 tis virtue that doth make them most admired
 the contrary doth make thee wonder'd at
 tis government that makes them seem divine
 the want thereof makes thee abominable
 thou art as opposite to every good
 as the antipodes are unto us
 or as the south to the septentrion
 o tiger's heart wrapt in a woman's hide
 how couldst thou drain the lifeblood of the child
 to bid the father wipe his eyes withal
 and yet be seen to bear a woman's face
 women are soft mild pitiful and flexible
 thou stern obdurate flinty rough remorseless
 bids't thou me rage why now thou hast thy wish
 wouldst have me weep why now thou hast thy will
 for raging wind blows up incessant showers
 and when the rage allays the rain begins
 these tears are my sweet rutland's obsequies
 and every drop cries vengeance for his death
 gainst thee fell clifford and thee false
 frenchwoman
northumberland beshrew me but his passion moves me so
 that hardly can i cheque my eyes from tears
york that face of his the hungry cannibals
 would not have touch'd would not have stain'd with blood
 but you are more inhuman more inexorable
 o ten times more than tigers of hyrcania
 see ruthless queen a hapless father's tears
 this cloth thou dip'dst in blood of my sweet boy
 and i with tears do wash the blood away
 keep thou the napkin and go boast of this
 and if thou tell'st the heavy story right
 upon my soul the hearers will shed tears
 yea even my foes will shed fastfalling tears
 and say alas it was a piteous deed'
 there take the crown and with the crown my curse
 and in thy need such comfort come to thee
 as now i reap at thy too cruel hand
 hardhearted clifford take me from the world
 my soul to heaven my blood upon your heads
northumberland had he been slaughterman to all my kin
 i should not for my life but weep with him
 to see how inly sorrow gripes his soul
queen margaret what weepingripe my lord northumberland
 think but upon the wrong he did us all
 and that will quickly dry thy melting tears
clifford here's for my oath here's for my father's death
 stabbing him
queen margaret and here's to right our gentlehearted king
 stabbing him
york open thy gate of mercy gracious god
 my soul flies through these wounds to seek out thee
 dies
queen margaret off with his head and set it on york gates
 so york may overlook the town of york
 flourish exeunt
 3 king henry vi
act ii
scene i a plain near mortimer's cross in herefordshire
 a march enter edward richard and their power
edward i wonder how our princely father scaped
 or whether he be scaped away or no
 from clifford's and northumberland's pursuit
 had he been ta'en we should have heard the news
 had he been slain we should have heard the news
 or had he scaped methinks we should have heard
 the happy tidings of his good escape
 how fares my brother why is he so sad
richard i cannot joy until i be resolved
 where our right valiant father is become
 i saw him in the battle range about
 and watch'd him how he singled clifford forth
 methought he bore him in the thickest troop
 as doth a lion in a herd of neat
 or as a bear encompass'd round with dogs
 who having pinch'd a few and made them cry
 the rest stand all aloof and bark at him
 so fared our father with his enemies
 so fled his enemies my warlike father
 methinks tis prize enough to be his son
 see how the morning opes her golden gates
 and takes her farewell of the glorious sun
 how well resembles it the prime of youth
 trimm'd like a younker prancing to his love
edward dazzle mine eyes or do i see three suns
richard three glorious suns each one a perfect sun
 not separated with the racking clouds
 but sever'd in a pale clearshining sky
 see see they join embrace and seem to kiss
 as if they vow'd some league inviolable
 now are they but one lamp one light one sun
 in this the heaven figures some event
edward tis wondrous strange the like yet never heard of
 i think it cites us brother to the field
 that we the sons of brave plantagenet
 each one already blazing by our meeds
 should notwithstanding join our lights together
 and overshine the earth as this the world
 whate'er it bodes henceforward will i bear
 upon my target three fairshining suns
richard nay bear three daughters by your leave i speak it
 you love the breeder better than the male
 enter a messenger
 but what art thou whose heavy looks foretell
 some dreadful story hanging on thy tongue
messenger ah one that was a woful lookeron
 when as the noble duke of york was slain
 your princely father and my loving lord
edward o speak no more for i have heard too much
richard say how he died for i will hear it all
messenger environed he was with many foes
 and stood against them as the hope of troy
 against the greeks that would have enter'd troy
 but hercules himself must yield to odds
 and many strokes though with a little axe
 hew down and fell the hardesttimber'd oak
 by many hands your father was subdued
 but only slaughter'd by the ireful arm
 of unrelenting clifford and the queen
 who crown'd the gracious duke in high despite
 laugh'd in his face and when with grief he wept
 the ruthless queen gave him to dry his cheeks
 a napkin steeped in the harmless blood
 of sweet young rutland by rough clifford slain
 and after many scorns many foul taunts
 they took his head and on the gates of york
 they set the same and there it doth remain
 the saddest spectacle that e'er i view'd
edward sweet duke of york our prop to lean upon
