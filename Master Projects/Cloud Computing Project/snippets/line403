 of the king's look's hath a heart that is not
 glad at the thing they scowl at
second gentleman and why so
first gentleman he that hath miss'd the princess is a thing
 too bad for bad report and he that hath her
 i mean that married her alack good man
 and therefore banish'dis a creature such
 as to seek through the regions of the earth
 for one his like there would be something failing
 in him that should compare i do not think
 so fair an outward and such stuff within
 endows a man but he
second gentleman you speak him far
first gentleman i do extend him sir within himself
 crush him together rather than unfold
 his measure duly
second gentleman what's his name and birth
first gentleman i cannot delve him to the root his father
 was call'd sicilius who did join his honour
 against the romans with cassibelan
 but had his titles by tenantius whom
 he served with glory and admired success
 so gain'd the suraddition leonatus
 and had besides this gentleman in question
 two other sons who in the wars o the time
 died with their swords in hand for which
 their father
 then old and fond of issue took such sorrow
 that he quit being and his gentle lady
 big of this gentleman our theme deceased
 as he was born the king he takes the babe
 to his protection calls him posthumus leonatus
 breeds him and makes him of his bedchamber
 puts to him all the learnings that his time
 could make him the receiver of which he took
 as we do air fast as twas minister'd
 and in's spring became a harvest lived in court
 which rare it is to domost praised most loved
 a sample to the youngest to the more mature
 a glass that feated them and to the graver
 a child that guided dotards to his mistress
 for whom he now is banish'd her own price
 proclaims how she esteem'd him and his virtue
 by her election may be truly read
 what kind of man he is
second gentleman i honour him
 even out of your report but pray you tell me
 is she sole child to the king
first gentleman his only child
 he had two sons if this be worth your hearing
 mark it the eldest of them at three years old
 i the swathingclothes the other from their nursery
 were stol'n and to this hour no guess in knowledge
 which way they went
second gentleman how long is this ago
first gentleman some twenty years
second gentleman that a king's children should be so convey'd
 so slackly guarded and the search so slow
 that could not trace them
first gentleman howsoe'er tis strange
 or that the negligence may well be laugh'd at
 yet is it true sir
second gentleman i do well believe you
first gentleman we must forbear here comes the gentleman
 the queen and princess
 exeunt
 enter the queen posthumus leonatus and imogen
queen no be assured you shall not find me daughter
 after the slander of most stepmothers
 evileyed unto you you're my prisoner but
 your gaoler shall deliver you the keys
 that lock up your restraint for you posthumus
 so soon as i can win the offended king
 i will be known your advocate marry yet
 the fire of rage is in him and twere good
 you lean'd unto his sentence with what patience
 your wisdom may inform you
posthumus leonatus please your highness

queen you know the peril
 i'll fetch a turn about the garden pitying
 the pangs of barr'd affections though the king
 hath charged you should not speak together
 exit
imogen o
 dissembling courtesy how fine this tyrant
 can tickle where she wounds my dearest husband
 i something fear my father's wrath but nothing
 always reserved my holy dutywhat
 his rage can do on me you must be gone
 and i shall here abide the hourly shot
 of angry eyes not comforted to live
 but that there is this jewel in the world
 that i may see again
posthumus leonatus my queen my mistress
 o lady weep no more lest i give cause
 to be suspected of more tenderness
 than doth become a man i will remain
 the loyal'st husband that did e'er plight troth
 my residence in rome at one philario's
 who to my father was a friend to me
 known but by letter thither write my queen
 and with mine eyes i'll drink the words you send
 though ink be made of gall
 reenter queen
queen be brief i pray you
 if the king come i shall incur i know not
 how much of his displeasure
 aside
 yet i'll move him
 to walk this way i never do him wrong
 but he does buy my injuries to be friends
 pays dear for my offences
 exit
posthumus leonatus should we be taking leave
 as long a term as yet we have to live
 the loathness to depart would grow adieu
imogen nay stay a little
 were you but riding forth to air yourself
 such parting were too petty look here love
 this diamond was my mother's take it heart
 but keep it till you woo another wife
 when imogen is dead
posthumus leonatus how how another
 you gentle gods give me but this i have
 and sear up my embracements from a next
 with bonds of death
 putting on the ring
 remain remain thou here
 while sense can keep it on and sweetest fairest
 as i my poor self did exchange for you
 to your so infinite loss so in our trifles
 i still win of you for my sake wear this
 it is a manacle of love i'll place it
 upon this fairest prisoner
 putting a bracelet upon her arm
imogen o the gods
 when shall we see again
 enter cymbeline and lords
posthumus leonatus alack the king
cymbeline thou basest thing avoid hence from my sight
 if after this command thou fraught the court
 with thy unworthiness thou diest away

posthumus leonatus the gods protect you
 and bless the good remainders of the court i am gone
 exit
imogen there cannot be a pinch in death
 more sharp than this is
cymbeline o disloyal thing
 that shouldst repair my youth thou heap'st
 a year's age on me
imogen i beseech you sir
 harm not yourself with your vexation
 i am senseless of your wrath a touch more rare
 subdues all pangs all fears
cymbeline past grace obedience
imogen past hope and in despair that way past grace
cymbeline that mightst have had the sole son of my queen
imogen o blest that i might not i chose an eagle
 and did avoid a puttock
cymbeline thou took'st a beggar wouldst have made my throne
 a seat for baseness
imogen no i rather added
 a lustre to it
cymbeline o thou vile one
imogen sir
 it is your fault that i have loved posthumus
 you bred him as my playfellow and he is
 a man worth any woman overbuys me
 almost the sum he pays
cymbeline what art thou mad
imogen almost sir heaven restore me would i were
 a neatherd's daughter and my leonatus
 our neighbour shepherd's son
cymbeline thou foolish thing
 reenter queen
 they were again together you have done
 not after our command away with her
 and pen her up
queen beseech your patience peace
 dear lady daughter peace sweet sovereign
 leave us to ourselves and make yourself some comfort
 out of your best advice

 a drop of blood a day and being aged
 die of this folly
 exeunt cymbeline and lords
queen fie you must give way
 enter pisanio

 by gentlemen at hand
queen i am very glad on't
imogen your son's my father's friend he takes his part
