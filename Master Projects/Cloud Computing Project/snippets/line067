thou hast sent widows away empty and the arms of the fatherless have been broken
therefore snares are round about thee and sudden fear troubleth thee
or darkness that thou canst not see and abundance of waters cover thee
is not god in the height of heaven and behold the height of the stars how high they are
and thou sayest how doth god know can he judge through the dark cloud
thick clouds are a covering to him that he seeth not and he walketh in the circuit of heaven
hast thou marked the old way which wicked men have trodden
which were cut down out of time whose foundation was overflown with a flood
which said unto god depart from us and what can the almighty do for them
yet he filled their houses with good things but the counsel of the wicked is far from me
the righteous see it and are glad and the innocent laugh them to scorn
whereas our substance is not cut down but the remnant of them the fire consumeth
acquaint now thyself with him and be at peace thereby good shall come unto thee
receive i pray thee the law from his mouth and lay up his words in thine heart
if thou return to the almighty thou shalt be built up thou shalt put away iniquity far from thy tabernacles
then shalt thou lay up gold as dust and the gold of ophir as the stones of the brooks
yea the almighty shall be thy defence and thou shalt have plenty of silver
for then shalt thou have thy delight in the almighty and shalt lift up thy face unto god
thou shalt make thy prayer unto him and he shall hear thee and thou shalt pay thy vows
thou shalt also decree a thing and it shall be established unto thee and the light shall shine upon thy ways
when men are cast down then thou shalt say there is lifting up and he shall save the humble person
he shall deliver the island of the innocent and it is delivered by the pureness of thine hands
then job answered and said
even to day is my complaint bitter my stroke is heavier than my groaning
oh that i knew where i might find him that i might come even to his seat
i would order my cause before him and fill my mouth with arguments
i would know the words which he would answer me and understand what he would say unto me
will he plead against me with his great power no but he would put strength in me
there the righteous might dispute with him so should i be delivered for ever from my judge
behold i go forward but he is not there and backward but i cannot perceive him
on the left hand where he doth work but i cannot behold him he hideth himself on the right hand that i cannot see him
but he knoweth the way that i take when he hath tried me i shall come forth as gold
my foot hath held his steps his way have i kept and not declined
neither have i gone back from the commandment of his lips i have esteemed the words of his mouth more than my necessary food
but he is in one mind and who can turn him and what his soul desireth even that he doeth
for he performeth the thing that is appointed for me and many such things are with him
therefore am i troubled at his presence when i consider i am afraid of him
for god maketh my heart soft and the almighty troubleth me
because i was not cut off before the darkness neither hath he covered the darkness from my face
why seeing times are not hidden from the almighty do they that know him not see his days
some remove the landmarks they violently take away flocks and feed thereof
they drive away the ass of the fatherless they take the widow's ox for a pledge
they turn the needy out of the way the poor of the earth hide themselves together
behold as wild asses in the desert go they forth to their work rising betimes for a prey the wilderness yieldeth food for them and for their children
they reap every one his corn in the field and they gather the vintage of the wicked
they cause the naked to lodge without clothing that they have no covering in the cold
they are wet with the showers of the mountains and embrace the rock for want of a shelter
they pluck the fatherless from the breast and take a pledge of the poor
they cause him to go naked without clothing and they take away the sheaf from the hungry
which make oil within their walls and tread their winepresses and suffer thirst
men groan from out of the city and the soul of the wounded crieth out yet god layeth not folly to them
they are of those that rebel against the light they know not the ways thereof nor abide in the paths thereof
the murderer rising with the light killeth the poor and needy and in the night is as a thief
the eye also of the adulterer waiteth for the twilight saying no eye shall see me and disguiseth his face
in the dark they dig through houses which they had marked for themselves in the daytime they know not the light
for the morning is to them even as the shadow of death if one know them they are in the terrors of the shadow of death
he is swift as the waters their portion is cursed in the earth he beholdeth not the way of the vineyards
drought and heat consume the snow waters so doth the grave those which have sinned
the womb shall forget him the worm shall feed sweetly on him he shall be no more remembered and wickedness shall be broken as a tree
he evil entreateth the barren that beareth not and doeth not good to the widow
he draweth also the mighty with his power he riseth up and no man is sure of life
though it be given him to be in safety whereon he resteth yet his eyes are upon their ways
they are exalted for a little while but are gone and brought low they are taken out of the way as all other and cut off as the tops of the ears of corn
and if it be not so now who will make me a liar and make my speech nothing worth
then answered bildad the shuhite and said
dominion and fear are with him he maketh peace in his high places
is there any number of his armies and upon whom doth not his light arise
how then can man be justified with god or how can he be clean that is born of a woman
behold even to the moon and it shineth not yea the stars are not pure in his sight
how much less man that is a worm and the son of man which is a worm
but job answered and said
how hast thou helped him that is without power how savest thou the arm that hath no strength
how hast thou counselled him that hath no wisdom and how hast thou plentifully declared the thing as it is
to whom hast thou uttered words and whose spirit came from thee
dead things are formed from under the waters and the inhabitants thereof
hell is naked before him and destruction hath no covering
he stretcheth out the north over the empty place and hangeth the earth upon nothing
he bindeth up the waters in his thick clouds and the cloud is not rent under them
he holdeth back the face of his throne and spreadeth his cloud upon it
he hath compassed the waters with bounds until the day and night come to an end
the pillars of heaven tremble and are astonished at his reproof
he divideth the sea with his power and by his understanding he smiteth through the proud
by his spirit he hath garnished the heavens his hand hath formed the crooked serpent
lo these are parts of his ways but how little a portion is heard of him but the thunder of his power who can understand
moreover job continued his parable and said
as god liveth who hath taken away my judgment and the almighty who hath vexed my soul
all the while my breath is in me and the spirit of god is in my nostrils
my lips shall not speak wickedness nor my tongue utter deceit
god forbid that i should justify you till i die i will not remove mine integrity from me
my righteousness i hold fast and will not let it go my heart shall not reproach me so long as i live
let mine enemy be as the wicked and he that riseth up against me as the unrighteous
for what is the hope of the hypocrite though he hath gained when god taketh away his soul
will god hear his cry when trouble cometh upon him
will he delight himself in the almighty will he always call upon god
i will teach you by the hand of god that which is with the almighty will i not conceal
behold all ye yourselves have seen it why then are ye thus altogether vain
this is the portion of a wicked man with god and the heritage of oppressors which they shall receive of the almighty
if his children be multiplied it is for the sword and his offspring shall not be satisfied with bread
those that remain of him shall be buried in death and his widows shall not weep
though he heap up silver as the dust and prepare raiment as the clay
he may prepare it but the just shall put it on and the innocent shall divide the silver
he buildeth his house as a moth and as a booth that the keeper maketh
the rich man shall lie down but he shall not be gathered he openeth his eyes and he is not
terrors take hold on him as waters a tempest stealeth him away in the night
the east wind carrieth him away and he departeth and as a storm hurleth him out of his place
for god shall cast upon him and not spare he would fain flee out of his hand
men shall clap their hands at him and shall hiss him out of his place
surely there is a vein for the silver and a place for gold where they fine it
iron is taken out of the earth and brass is molten out of the stone
he setteth an end to darkness and searcheth out all perfection the stones of darkness and the shadow of death
the flood breaketh out from the inhabitant even the waters forgotten of the foot they are dried up they are gone away from men
as for the earth out of it cometh bread and under it is turned up as it were fire
the stones of it are the place of sapphires and it hath dust of gold
there is a path which no fowl knoweth and which the vulture's eye hath not seen
the lion's whelps have not trodden it nor the fierce lion passed by it
he putteth forth his hand upon the rock he overturneth the mountains by the roots
he cutteth out rivers among the rocks and his eye seeth every precious thing
he bindeth the floods from overflowing and the thing that is hid bringeth he forth to light
but where shall wisdom be found and where is the place of understanding
man knoweth not the price thereof neither is it found in the land of the living
the depth saith it is not in me and the sea saith it is not with me
it cannot be gotten for gold neither shall silver be weighed for the price thereof
it cannot be valued with the gold of ophir with the precious onyx or the sapphire
the gold and the crystal cannot equal it and the exchange of it shall not be for jewels of fine gold
no mention shall be made of coral or of pearls for the price of wisdom is above rubies
the topaz of ethiopia shall not equal it neither shall it be valued with pure gold
whence then cometh wisdom and where is the place of understanding
seeing it is hid from the eyes of all living and kept close from the fowls of the air
destruction and death say we have heard the fame thereof with our ears
god understandeth the way thereof and he knoweth the place thereof
for he looketh to the ends of the earth and seeth under the whole heaven
to make the weight for the winds and he weigheth the waters by measure
when he made a decree for the rain and a way for the lightning of the thunder
then did he see it and declare it he prepared it yea and searched it out
and unto man he said behold the fear of the lord that is wisdom and to depart from evil is understanding
moreover job continued his parable and said
oh that i were as in months past as in the days when god preserved me
when his candle shined upon my head and when by his light i walked through darkness
as i was in the days of my youth when the secret of god was upon my tabernacle
when the almighty was yet with me when my children were about me
when i washed my steps with butter and the rock poured me out rivers of oil
when i went out to the gate through the city when i prepared my seat in the street
the young men saw me and hid themselves and the aged arose and stood up
the princes refrained talking and laid their hand on their mouth
the nobles held their peace and their tongue cleaved to the roof of their mouth
when the ear heard me then it blessed me and when the eye saw me it gave witness to me
because i delivered the poor that cried and the fatherless and him that had none to help him
the blessing of him that was ready to perish came upon me and i caused the widow's heart to sing for joy
i put on righteousness and it clothed me my judgment was as a robe and a diadem
i was eyes to the blind and feet was i to the lame
i was a father to the poor and the cause which i knew not i searched out
and i brake the jaws of the wicked and plucked the spoil out of his teeth
then i said i shall die in my nest and i shall multiply my days as the sand
my root was spread out by the waters and the dew lay all night upon my branch
my glory was fresh in me and my bow was renewed in my hand
unto me men gave ear and waited and kept silence at my counsel
after my words they spake not again and my speech dropped upon them
and they waited for me as for the rain and they opened their mouth wide as for the latter rain
if i laughed on them they believed it not and the light of my countenance they cast not down
i chose out their way and sat chief and dwelt as a king in the army as one that comforteth the mourners
but now they that are younger than i have me in derision whose fathers i would have disdained to have set with the dogs of my flock
yea whereto might the strength of their hands profit me in whom old age was perished
for want and famine they were solitary fleeing into the wilderness in former time desolate and waste
who cut up mallows by the bushes and juniper roots for their meat
they were driven forth from among men they cried after them as after a thief
to dwell in the cliffs of the valleys in caves of the earth and in the rocks
among the bushes they brayed under the nettles they were gathered together
they were children of fools yea children of base men they were viler than the earth
and now am i their song yea i am their byword
they abhor me they flee far from me and spare not to spit in my face
because he hath loosed my cord and afflicted me they have also let loose the bridle before me
upon my right hand rise the youth they push away my feet and they raise up against me the ways of their destruction
they mar my path they set forward my calamity they have no helper
they came upon me as a wide breaking in of waters in the desolation they rolled themselves upon me
terrors are turned upon me they pursue my soul as the wind and my welfare passeth away as a cloud
and now my soul is poured out upon me the days of affliction have taken hold upon me
my bones are pierced in me in the night season and my sinews take no rest
by the great force of my disease is my garment changed it bindeth me about as the collar of my coat
he hath cast me into the mire and i am become like dust and ashes
i cry unto thee and thou dost not hear me i stand up and thou regardest me not
thou art become cruel to me with thy strong hand thou opposest thyself against me
thou liftest me up to the wind thou causest me to ride upon it and dissolvest my substance
for i know that thou wilt bring me to death and to the house appointed for all living
howbeit he will not stretch out his hand to the grave though they cry in his destruction
did not i weep for him that was in trouble was not my soul grieved for the poor
when i looked for good then evil came unto me and when i waited for light there came darkness
my bowels boiled and rested not the days of affliction prevented me
i went mourning without the sun i stood up and i cried in the congregation
i am a brother to dragons and a companion to owls
my skin is black upon me and my bones are burned with heat
my harp also is turned to mourning and my organ into the voice of them that weep
i made a covenant with mine eyes why then should i think upon a maid
for what portion of god is there from above and what inheritance of the almighty from on high
is not destruction to the wicked and a strange punishment to the workers of iniquity
doth not he see my ways and count all my steps
if i have walked with vanity or if my foot hath hasted to deceit
let me be weighed in an even balance that god may know mine integrity
if my step hath turned out of the way and mine heart walked after mine eyes and if any blot hath cleaved to mine hands
then let me sow and let another eat yea let my offspring be rooted out
if mine heart have been deceived by a woman or if i have laid wait at my neighbour's door
