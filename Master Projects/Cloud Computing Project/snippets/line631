 here said they is the terror of the french
 the scarecrow that affrights our children so
 then broke i from the officers that led me
 and with my nails digg'd stones out of the ground
 to hurl at the beholders of my shame
 my grisly countenance made others fly
 none durst come near for fear of sudden death
 in iron walls they deem'd me not secure
 so great fear of my name mongst them was spread
 that they supposed i could rend bars of steel
 and spurn in pieces posts of adamant
 wherefore a guard of chosen shot i had
 that walked about me every minutewhile
 and if i did but stir out of my bed
 ready they were to shoot me to the heart
 enter the boy with a linstock
salisbury i grieve to hear what torments you endured
 but we will be revenged sufficiently
 now it is suppertime in orleans
 here through this grate i count each one
 and view the frenchmen how they fortify
 let us look in the sight will much delight thee
 sir thomas gargrave and sir william glansdale
 let me have your express opinions
 where is best place to make our battery next
gargrave i think at the north gate for there stand lords
glansdale and i here at the bulwark of the bridge
talbot for aught i see this city must be famish'd
 or with light skirmishes enfeebled
 here they shoot salisbury and gargrave fall
salisbury o lord have mercy on us wretched sinners
gargrave o lord have mercy on me woful man
talbot what chance is this that suddenly hath cross'd us
 speak salisbury at least if thou canst speak
 how farest thou mirror of all martial men
 one of thy eyes and thy cheek's side struck off
 accursed tower accursed fatal hand
 that hath contrived this woful tragedy
 in thirteen battles salisbury o'ercame
 henry the fifth he first train'd to the wars
 whilst any trump did sound or drum struck up
 his sword did ne'er leave striking in the field
 yet livest thou salisbury though thy speech doth fail
 one eye thou hast to look to heaven for grace
 the sun with one eye vieweth all the world
 heaven be thou gracious to none alive
 if salisbury wants mercy at thy hands
 bear hence his body i will help to bury it
 sir thomas gargrave hast thou any life
 speak unto talbot nay look up to him
 salisbury cheer thy spirit with this comfort
 thou shalt not die whiles
 he beckons with his hand and smiles on me
 as who should say when i am dead and gone
 remember to avenge me on the french'
 plantagenet i will and like thee nero
 play on the lute beholding the towns burn
 wretched shall france be only in my name
 here an alarum and it thunders and lightens
 what stir is this what tumult's in the heavens
 whence cometh this alarum and the noise
 enter a messenger
messenger my lord my lord the french have gathered head
 the dauphin with one joan la pucelle join'd
 a holy prophetess new risen up
 is come with a great power to raise the siege
 here salisbury lifteth himself up and groans
talbot hear hear how dying salisbury doth groan
 it irks his heart he cannot be revenged
 frenchmen i'll be a salisbury to you
 pucelle or puzzel dolphin or dogfish
 your hearts i'll stamp out with my horse's heels
 and make a quagmire of your mingled brains
 convey me salisbury into his tent
 and then we'll try what these dastard frenchmen dare
 alarum exeunt
 1 king henry vi
act i
scene v the same
 here an alarum again and talbot pursueth the
 dauphin and driveth him then enter joan la
 pucelle driving englishmen before her and exit
 after them then reenter talbot
talbot where is my strength my valour and my force
 our english troops retire i cannot stay them
 a woman clad in armour chaseth them
 reenter joan la pucelle
 here here she comes i'll have a bout with thee
 devil or devil's dam i'll conjure thee
 blood will i draw on thee thou art a witch
 and straightway give thy soul to him thou servest
joan la pucelle come come tis only i that must disgrace thee
 here they fight
talbot heavens can you suffer hell so to prevail
 my breast i'll burst with straining of my courage
 and from my shoulders crack my arms asunder
 but i will chastise this highminded strumpet
 they fight again
joan la pucelle talbot farewell thy hour is not yet come
 i must go victual orleans forthwith
 a short alarum then enter the town with soldiers
 o'ertake me if thou canst i scorn thy strength
 go go cheer up thy hungrystarved men
 help salisbury to make his testament
 this day is ours as many more shall be
 exit
talbot my thoughts are whirled like a potter's wheel
 i know not where i am nor what i do
 a witch by fear not force like hannibal
 drives back our troops and conquers as she lists
 so bees with smoke and doves with noisome stench
 are from their hives and houses driven away
 they call'd us for our fierceness english dogs
 now like to whelps we crying run away
 a short alarum
 hark countrymen either renew the fight
 or tear the lions out of england's coat
 renounce your soil give sheep in lions stead
 sheep run not half so treacherous from the wolf
 or horse or oxen from the leopard
 as you fly from your oftsubdued slaves
 alarum here another skirmish
 it will not be retire into your trenches
 you all consented unto salisbury's death
 for none would strike a stroke in his revenge
 pucelle is enter'd into orleans
 in spite of us or aught that we could do
 o would i were to die with salisbury
 the shame hereof will make me hide my head
 exit talbot alarum retreat flourish
 1 king henry vi
act i
scene vi the same
 enter on the walls joan la pucelle charles
 reignier alencon and soldiers
joan la pucelle advance our waving colours on the walls
 rescued is orleans from the english
 thus joan la pucelle hath perform'd her word
charles divinest creature astraea's daughter
 how shall i honour thee for this success
 thy promises are like adonis gardens
 that one day bloom'd and fruitful were the next
 france triumph in thy glorious prophetess
 recover'd is the town of orleans
 more blessed hap did ne'er befall our state
reignier why ring not out the bells aloud throughout the town
 dauphin command the citizens make bonfires
 and feast and banquet in the open streets
 to celebrate the joy that god hath given us
alencon all france will be replete with mirth and joy
 when they shall hear how we have play'd the men
charles tis joan not we by whom the day is won
 for which i will divide my crown with her
 and all the priests and friars in my realm
 shall in procession sing her endless praise
 a statelier pyramis to her i'll rear
 than rhodope's or memphis ever was
 in memory of her when she is dead
 her ashes in an urn more precious
 than the richjewel'd of darius
 transported shall be at high festivals
 before the kings and queens of france
 no longer on saint denis will we cry
 but joan la pucelle shall be france's saint
 come in and let us banquet royally
 after this golden day of victory
 flourish exeunt
 1 king henry vi
act ii
scene i before orleans
 enter a sergeant of a band with two sentinels
sergeant sirs take your places and be vigilant
 if any noise or soldier you perceive
 near to the walls by some apparent sign
 let us have knowledge at the court of guard
first sentinel sergeant you shall
 exit sergeant
 thus are poor servitors
 when others sleep upon their quiet beds
 constrain'd to watch in darkness rain and cold
 enter talbot bedford burgundy and forces with
 scalingladders their drums beating a dead march
talbot lord regent and redoubted burgundy
 by whose approach the regions of artois
 wallon and picardy are friends to us
 this happy night the frenchmen are secure
 having all day caroused and banqueted
 embrace we then this opportunity
 as fitting best to quittance their deceit
 contrived by art and baleful sorcery
bedford coward of france how much he wrongs his fame
 despairing of his own arm's fortitude
 to join with witches and the help of hell
burgundy traitors have never other company
 but what's that pucelle whom they term so pure
talbot a maid they say
bedford a maid and be so martial
burgundy pray god she prove not masculine ere long
 if underneath the standard of the french
 she carry armour as she hath begun
