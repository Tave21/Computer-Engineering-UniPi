1th38 for now we live if ye stand fast in the lord
1th39 for what thanks can we render to god again for you for all the joy wherewith we joy for your sakes before our god
1th310 night and day praying exceedingly that we might see your face and might perfect that which is lacking in your faith
1th311 now god himself and our father and our lord jesus christ direct our way unto you
1th312 and the lord make you to increase and abound in love one toward another and toward all men even as we do toward you
1th313 to the end he may stablish your hearts unblameable in holiness before god even our father at the coming of our lord jesus christ with all his saints
1th41 furthermore then we beseech you brethren and exhort you by the lord jesus that as ye have received of us how ye ought to walk and to please god so ye would abound more and more
1th42 for ye know what commandments we gave you by the lord jesus
1th43 for this is the will of god even your sanctification that ye should abstain from fornication
1th44 that every one of you should know how to possess his vessel in sanctification and honour
1th45 not in the lust of concupiscence even as the gentiles which know not god
1th46 that no man go beyond and defraud his brother in any matter because that the lord is the avenger of all such as we also have forewarned you and testified
1th47 for god hath not called us unto uncleanness but unto holiness
1th48 he therefore that despiseth despiseth not man but god who hath also given unto us his holy spirit
1th49 but as touching brotherly love ye need not that i write unto you for ye yourselves are taught of god to love one another
1th410 and indeed ye do it toward all the brethren which are in all macedonia but we beseech you brethren that ye increase more and more
1th411 and that ye study to be quiet and to do your own business and to work with your own hands as we commanded you
1th412 that ye may walk honestly toward them that are without and that ye may have lack of nothing
1th413 but i would not have you to be ignorant brethren concerning them which are asleep that ye sorrow not even as others which have no hope
1th414 for if we believe that jesus died and rose again even so them also which sleep in jesus will god bring with him
1th415 for this we say unto you by the word of the lord that we which are alive and remain unto the coming of the lord shall not prevent them which are asleep
1th416 for the lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout with the voice of the archangel and with the trump of god and the dead in christ shall rise first
1th417 then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the lord in the air and so shall we ever be with the lord
1th418 wherefore comfort one another with these words
1th51 but of the times and the seasons brethren ye have no need that i write unto you
1th52 for yourselves know perfectly that the day of the lord so cometh as a thief in the night
1th53 for when they shall say peace and safety then sudden destruction cometh upon them as travail upon a woman with child and they shall not escape
1th54 but ye brethren are not in darkness that that day should overtake you as a thief
1th55 ye are all the children of light and the children of the day we are not of the night nor of darkness
1th56 therefore let us not sleep as do others but let us watch and be sober
1th57 for they that sleep sleep in the night and they that be drunken are drunken in the night
1th58 but let us who are of the day be sober putting on the breastplate of faith and love and for an helmet the hope of salvation
1th59 for god hath not appointed us to wrath but to obtain salvation by our lord jesus christ
1th510 who died for us that whether we wake or sleep we should live together with him
1th511 wherefore comfort yourselves together and edify one another even as also ye do
1th512 and we beseech you brethren to know them which labour among you and are over you in the lord and admonish you
1th513 and to esteem them very highly in love for their work's sake and be at peace among yourselves
1th514 now we exhort you brethren warn them that are unruly comfort the feebleminded support the weak be patient toward all men
1th515 see that none render evil for evil unto any man but ever follow that which is good both among yourselves and to all men
1th516 rejoice evermore
1th517 pray without ceasing
1th518 in every thing give thanks for this is the will of god in christ jesus concerning you
1th519 quench not the spirit
1th520 despise not prophesyings
1th521 prove all things hold fast that which is good
1th522 abstain from all appearance of evil
1th523 and the very god of peace sanctify you wholly and i pray god your whole spirit and soul and body be preserved blameless unto the coming of our lord jesus christ
1th524 faithful is he that calleth you who also will do it
1th525 brethren pray for us
1th526 greet all the brethren with an holy kiss
1th527 i charge you by the lord that this epistle be read unto all the holy brethren
1th528 the grace of our lord jesus christ be with you amen
2th11 paul and silvanus and timotheus unto the church of the thessalonians in god our father and the lord jesus christ
2th12 grace unto you and peace from god our father and the lord jesus christ
2th13 we are bound to thank god always for you brethren as it is meet because that your faith groweth exceedingly and the charity of every one of you all toward each other aboundeth
2th14 so that we ourselves glory in you in the churches of god for your patience and faith in all your persecutions and tribulations that ye endure
2th15 which is a manifest token of the righteous judgment of god that ye may be counted worthy of the kingdom of god for which ye also suffer
2th16 seeing it is a righteous thing with god to recompense tribulation to them that trouble you
2th17 and to you who are troubled rest with us when the lord jesus shall be revealed from heaven with his mighty angels
2th18 in flaming fire taking vengeance on them that know not god and that obey not the gospel of our lord jesus christ
2th19 who shall be punished with everlasting destruction from the presence of the lord and from the glory of his power
2th110 when he shall come to be glorified in his saints and to be admired in all them that believe because our testimony among you was believed in that day
2th111 wherefore also we pray always for you that our god would count you worthy of this calling and fulfil all the good pleasure of his goodness and the work of faith with power
2th112 that the name of our lord jesus christ may be glorified in you and ye in him according to the grace of our god and the lord jesus christ
2th21 now we beseech you brethren by the coming of our lord jesus christ and by our gathering together unto him
2th22 that ye be not soon shaken in mind or be troubled neither by spirit nor by word nor by letter as from us as that the day of christ is at hand
2th23 let no man deceive you by any means for that day shall not come except there come a falling away first and that man of sin be revealed the son of perdition
2th24 who opposeth and exalteth himself above all that is called god or that is worshipped so that he as god sitteth in the temple of god shewing himself that he is god
2th25 remember ye not that when i was yet with you i told you these things
2th26 and now ye know what withholdeth that he might be revealed in his time
2th27 for the mystery of iniquity doth already work only he who now letteth will let until he be taken out of the way
2th28 and then shall that wicked be revealed whom the lord shall consume with the spirit of his mouth and shall destroy with the brightness of his coming
2th29 even him whose coming is after the working of satan with all power and signs and lying wonders
2th210 and with all deceivableness of unrighteousness in them that perish because they received not the love of the truth that they might be saved
2th211 and for this cause god shall send them strong delusion that they should believe a lie
2th212 that they all might be damned who believed not the truth but had pleasure in unrighteousness
2th213 but we are bound to give thanks alway to god for you brethren beloved of the lord because god hath from the beginning chosen you to salvation through sanctification of the spirit and belief of the truth
2th214 whereunto he called you by our gospel to the obtaining of the glory of our lord jesus christ
2th215 therefore brethren stand fast and hold the traditions which ye have been taught whether by word or our epistle
2th216 now our lord jesus christ himself and god even our father which hath loved us and hath given us everlasting consolation and good hope through grace
2th217 comfort your hearts and stablish you in every good word and work
2th31 finally brethren pray for us that the word of the lord may have free course and be glorified even as it is with you
2th32 and that we may be delivered from unreasonable and wicked men for all men have not faith
2th33 but the lord is faithful who shall stablish you and keep you from evil
2th34 and we have confidence in the lord touching you that ye both do and will do the things which we command you
2th35 and the lord direct your hearts into the love of god and into the patient waiting for christ
2th36 now we command you brethren in the name of our lord jesus christ that ye withdraw yourselves from every brother that walketh disorderly and not after the tradition which he received of us
2th37 for yourselves know how ye ought to follow us for we behaved not ourselves disorderly among you
2th38 neither did we eat any man's bread for nought but wrought with labour and travail night and day that we might not be chargeable to any of you
2th39 not because we have not power but to make ourselves an ensample unto you to follow us
2th310 for even when we were with you this we commanded you that if any would not work neither should he eat
2th311 for we hear that there are some which walk among you disorderly working not at all but are busybodies
2th312 now them that are such we command and exhort by our lord jesus christ that with quietness they work and eat their own bread
2th313 but ye brethren be not weary in well doing
2th314 and if any man obey not our word by this epistle note that man and have no company with him that he may be ashamed
2th315 yet count him not as an enemy but admonish him as a brother
2th316 now the lord of peace himself give you peace always by all means the lord be with you all
2th317 the salutation of paul with mine own hand which is the token in every epistle so i write
2th318 the grace of our lord jesus christ be with you all amen
1tim11 paul an apostle of jesus christ by the commandment of god our saviour and lord jesus christ which is our hope
1tim12 unto timothy my own son in the faith grace mercy and peace from god our father and jesus christ our lord
1tim13 as i besought thee to abide still at ephesus when i went into macedonia that thou mightest charge some that they teach no other doctrine
1tim14 neither give heed to fables and endless genealogies which minister questions rather than godly edifying which is in faith so do
1tim15 now the end of the commandment is charity out of a pure heart and of a good conscience and of faith unfeigned
1tim16 from which some having swerved have turned aside unto vain jangling
1tim17 desiring to be teachers of the law understanding neither what they say nor whereof they affirm
1tim18 but we know that the law is good if a man use it lawfully
1tim19 knowing this that the law is not made for a righteous man but for the lawless and disobedient for the ungodly and for sinners for unholy and profane for murderers of fathers and murderers of mothers for manslayers
1tim110 for whoremongers for them that defile themselves with mankind for menstealers for liars for perjured persons and if there be any other thing that is contrary to sound doctrine
1tim111 according to the glorious gospel of the blessed god which was committed to my trust
1tim112 and i thank christ jesus our lord who hath enabled me for that he counted me faithful putting me into the ministry
1tim113 who was before a blasphemer and a persecutor and injurious but i obtained mercy because i did it ignorantly in unbelief
1tim114 and the grace of our lord was exceeding abundant with faith and love which is in christ jesus
1tim115 this is a faithful saying and worthy of all acceptation that christ jesus came into the world to save sinners of whom i am chief
1tim116 howbeit for this cause i obtained mercy that in me first jesus christ might shew forth all longsuffering for a pattern to them which should hereafter believe on him to life everlasting
1tim117 now unto the king eternal immortal invisible the only wise god be honour and glory for ever and ever amen
1tim118 this charge i commit unto thee son timothy according to the prophecies which went before on thee that thou by them mightest war a good warfare
1tim119 holding faith and a good conscience which some having put away concerning faith have made shipwreck
1tim120 of whom is hymenaeus and alexander whom i have delivered unto satan that they may learn not to blaspheme
1tim21 i exhort therefore that first of all supplications prayers intercessions and giving of thanks be made for all men
1tim22 for kings and for all that are in authority that we may lead a quiet and peaceable life in all godliness and honesty
1tim23 for this is good and acceptable in the sight of god our saviour
1tim24 who will have all men to be saved and to come unto the knowledge of the truth
1tim25 for there is one god and one mediator between god and men the man christ jesus
1tim26 who gave himself a ransom for all to be testified in due time
1tim27 whereunto i am ordained a preacher and an apostle i speak the truth in christ and lie not a teacher of the gentiles in faith and verity
1tim28 i will therefore that men pray every where lifting up holy hands without wrath and doubting
1tim29 in like manner also that women adorn themselves in modest apparel with shamefacedness and sobriety not with broided hair or gold or pearls or costly array
1tim210 but which becometh women professing godliness with good works
1tim211 let the woman learn in silence with all subjection
1tim212 but i suffer not a woman to teach nor to usurp authority over the man but to be in silence
1tim213 for adam was first formed then eve
1tim214 and adam was not deceived but the woman being deceived was in the transgression
1tim215 notwithstanding she shall be saved in childbearing if they continue in faith and charity and holiness with sobriety
1tim31 this is a true saying if a man desire the office of a bishop he desireth a good work
1tim32 a bishop then must be blameless the husband of one wife vigilant sober of good behaviour given to hospitality apt to teach
1tim33 not given to wine no striker not greedy of filthy lucre but patient not a brawler not covetous
1tim34 one that ruleth well his own house having his children in subjection with all gravity
1tim35 for if a man know not how to rule his own house how shall he take care of the church of god
1tim36 not a novice lest being lifted up with pride he fall into the condemnation of the devil
1tim37 moreover he must have a good report of them which are without lest he fall into reproach and the snare of the devil
1tim38 likewise must the deacons be grave not doubletongued not given to much wine not greedy of filthy lucre
1tim39 holding the mystery of the faith in a pure conscience
1tim310 and let these also first be proved then let them use the office of a deacon being found blameless
1tim311 even so must their wives be grave not slanderers sober faithful in all things
1tim312 let the deacons be the husbands of one wife ruling their children and their own houses well
1tim313 for they that have used the office of a deacon well purchase to themselves a good degree and great boldness in the faith which is in christ jesus
1tim314 these things write i unto thee hoping to come unto thee shortly
1tim315 but if i tarry long that thou mayest know how thou oughtest to behave thyself in the house of god which is the church of the living god the pillar and ground of the truth
1tim316 and without controversy great is the mystery of godliness god was manifest in the flesh justified in the spirit seen of angels preached unto the gentiles believed on in the world received up into glory
1tim41 now the spirit speaketh expressly that in the latter times some shall depart from the faith giving heed to seducing spirits and doctrines of devils
1tim42 speaking lies in hypocrisy having their conscience seared with a hot iron
1tim43 forbidding to marry and commanding to abstain from meats which god hath created to be received with thanksgiving of them which believe and know the truth
1tim44 for every creature of god is good and nothing to be refused if it be received with thanksgiving
1tim45 for it is sanctified by the word of god and prayer
1tim46 if thou put the brethren in remembrance of these things thou shalt be a good minister of jesus christ nourished up in the words of faith and of good doctrine whereunto thou hast attained
1tim47 but refuse profane and old wives fables and exercise thyself rather unto godliness
1tim48 for bodily exercise profiteth little but godliness is profitable unto all things having promise of the life that now is and of that which is to come
1tim49 this is a faithful saying and worthy of all acceptation
1tim410 for therefore we both labour and suffer reproach because we trust in the living god who is the saviour of all men specially of those that believe
1tim411 these things command and teach
1tim412 let no man despise thy youth but be thou an example of the believers in word in conversation in charity in spirit in faith in purity
1tim413 till i come give attendance to reading to exhortation to doctrine
1tim414 neglect not the gift that is in thee which was given thee by prophecy with the laying on of the hands of the presbytery
1tim415 meditate upon these things give thyself wholly to them that thy profiting may appear to all
1tim416 take heed unto thyself and unto the doctrine continue in them for in doing this thou shalt both save thyself and them that hear thee
1tim51 rebuke not an elder but intreat him as a father and the younger men as brethren
1tim52 the elder women as mothers the younger as sisters with all purity
1tim53 honour widows that are widows indeed
1tim54 but if any widow have children or nephews let them learn first to shew piety at home and to requite their parents for that is good and acceptable before god
1tim55 now she that is a widow indeed and desolate trusteth in god and continueth in supplications and prayers night and day
1tim56 but she that liveth in pleasure is dead while she liveth
1tim57 and these things give in charge that they may be blameless
1tim58 but if any provide not for his own and specially for those of his own house he hath denied the faith and is worse than an infidel
1tim59 let not a widow be taken into the number under threescore years old having been the wife of one man
1tim510 well reported of for good works if she have brought up children if she have lodged strangers if she have washed the saints feet if she have relieved the afflicted if she have diligently followed every good work
1tim511 but the younger widows refuse for when they have begun to wax wanton against christ they will marry
1tim512 having damnation because they have cast off their first faith
1tim513 and withal they learn to be idle wandering about from house to house and not only idle but tattlers also and busybodies speaking things which they ought not
1tim514 i will therefore that the younger women marry bear children guide the house give none occasion to the adversary to speak reproachfully
1tim515 for some are already turned aside after satan
1tim516 if any man or woman that believeth have widows let them relieve them and let not the church be charged that it may relieve them that are widows indeed
1tim517 let the elders that rule well be counted worthy of double honour especially they who labour in the word and doctrine
1tim518 for the scripture saith thou shalt not muzzle the ox that treadeth out the corn and the labourer is worthy of his reward
1tim519 against an elder receive not an accusation but before two or three witnesses
1tim520 them that sin rebuke before all that others also may fear
1tim521 i charge thee before god and the lord jesus christ and the elect angels that thou observe these things without preferring one before another doing nothing by partiality
1tim522 lay hands suddenly on no man neither be partaker of other men's sins keep thyself pure
1tim523 drink no longer water but use a little wine for thy stomach's sake and thine often infirmities
1tim524 some men's sins are open beforehand going before to judgment and some men they follow after
1tim525 likewise also the good works of some are manifest beforehand and they that are otherwise cannot be hid
1tim61 let as many servants as are under the yoke count their own masters worthy of all honour that the name of god and his doctrine be not blasphemed
1tim62 and they that have believing masters let them not despise them because they are brethren but rather do them service because they are faithful and beloved partakers of the benefit these things teach and exhort
1tim63 if any man teach otherwise and consent not to wholesome words even the words of our lord jesus christ and to the doctrine which is according to godliness
1tim64 he is proud knowing nothing but doting about questions and strifes of words whereof cometh envy strife railings evil surmisings
1tim65 perverse disputings of men of corrupt minds and destitute of the truth supposing that gain is godliness from such withdraw thyself
1tim66 but godliness with contentment is great gain
1tim67 for we brought nothing into this world and it is certain we can carry nothing out
1tim68 and having food and raiment let us be therewith content
1tim69 but they that will be rich fall into temptation and a snare and into many foolish and hurtful lusts which drown men in destruction and perdition
